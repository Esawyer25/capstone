"9234515","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries. Insulin resistance is a common feature of PCOS, and the resultant hyperinsulinemia has been theorized to promote hyperandrogenism in the disorder. However, 30-50% of women with PCOS who are lean do not have insulin resistance. Women with PCOS also exhibit chronic low-grade inflammation. We have shown that in PCOS, glucose ingestion activates nuclear factor ?B (NF?B), the cardinal signal of inflammation culminating in upregulation of the inflammation pathway within mononuclear cells (MNC). This phenomenon is independent of excess adiposity and is highly correlated with circulating androgens. In addition, in vitro exposure to proinflammatory stimuli is capable of directly stimulating ovarian theca cell androgen production. Salicylate administration has been shown to suppress NF?B activation, and the nonacetylated form of salicylate is well tolerated in humans. The proposed research is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of 90 women with PCOS. Forty-five subjects with PCOS (15 lean without insulin resistance (IR), 15 lean with IR and 15 obese) receiving salsalate, a nonacetylated salicylate, at an oral dose of 3-4 gm daily for 12 weeks will be compared with 45 age- and body-composition-matched control women with PCOS receiving placebo. The overarching hypothesis is that inflammation contributes to ovarian dysfunction, independent of excess adiposity or IR. The specific aims are, I: To examine the effect of salsalate administration on the ovarian capacity to secrete androgen on and insulin sensitivity in PCOS. II: To examine the effect of salsalate administration on the inflammatory response of mononuclear cells induced by lipid ingestion and glucose infusion in PCOS. The approach involves evaluation of ovarian androgen secretion in response to human chorionic gonadotropin administration and insulin sensitivity during the euglycemic phase of a two-step pancreatic clamp along with ovulation monitoring before and after salsalate administration. The inflammatory response of MNC to lipid ingestion and the hyperglycemic phase of the two-step clamp will also be evaluated during treatment by measuring reactive oxygen species, the RNA and protein content of inflammation markers, nuclear factor ?B activation and cytokine release in culture. It is our expectation that women wit PCOS receiving salsalate will exhibit decreased ovarian androgen secretion and reduced inflammation regardless of degree of adiposity or IR status. These results will be significant because they will show that in PCOS, treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent directly attenuates ovarian androgen secretion and inflammation triggered by dietary components. This will lead to important advances in the therapy of PCOS that will ameliorate androgen excess and by reducing inflammation."

"9420064","PROJECT SUMMARY DESCRIPTION: Dementia, especially Alzheimer?s dementia (AD), is a growing public health problem with a prevalence of 5M in the US alone (33M worldwide). Despite a decrease in incidence rates, with the aging of the population, the prevalence of dementia is expected to increase to 16M in the US (115M worldwide) with associated costs rising to $1T. Delaying long-term care by 1 month for older Americans would save $60B annually in direct care cost. Efforts to prevent or delay dementia have been largely unsuccessful. However, major depressive disorder in late life (?late-life depression?, LLD) has been identified as one of six treatable risk factors for dementia, especially AD and vascular dementia. The depression-dementia relationship may be magnified in elders who do not respond to antidepressant treatment and experience persistent symptoms. Thus, resolving whether those with treatment-resistant late-life depression (TRLLD) are at higher risk of cognitive decline and progression to dementia compared to those with treatment-responsive LLD is critically important. Leveraging a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded treatment study of N=1500 people with LLD, across 5 sites, we propose to comprehensively delineate neurocognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers associated with progression to dementia in people with persistent LLD (i.e., TRLLD) compared to those whose LLD remits with treatment. We anticipate enrolling 750 elders with LLD and characterizing their symptomatic trajectory over 24 months. We will assess each participant at three time points with neurocognitive and advanced neuroimaging. We hypothesize that changes in executive functions and the executive control network, as well as changes in episodic memory and the default mode/cortico-limbic network, will be greater in those with TRLLD than in those who respond to treatment and stay well. We also hypothesize that changes over two years in executive function and episodic memory will be specifically associated with changes in executive- control and cortico-limbic circuitry, respectively. Based on our recent findings that inflammatory and related molecularmarkers can differentiate those with neurocognitive impairment and LLD from those with LLD alone, we will build a predictive multivariate model combining baseline neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and plasmaprotein data to determine who is at greatest risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Finally, we will also explore whether latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms can go beyond the dichotomy of remission/non-remission to identify subsets of elders with LLD at highest risk of cognitive decline, neural circuit change, and progression to dementia. This work will set the stage for neural circuit- targeted preventive care to delay dementia in subsets of older patients with LLD. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting the depression- dementia pathway and reduce suffering for large numbers of elders and their families."
"9408438","Abstract/Project Summary:  HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly effective for HIV prevention in randomized clinical trials but uptake of PrEP in the U.S. has been limited. One of the barriers to PrEP implementation is lack of healthcare provider (HCP) knowledge and willingness to prescribe it. As outcomes of current PrEP formulations in real-world settings and different populations are reported and novel PrEP formulations are introduced, HCPs will continue to require support and guidance to optimize the clinical and public health impact of this valuable HIV prevention strategy. We propose a PrEP optimization intervention targeted at HCPs to increase PrEP uptake and persistence among those at risk for HIV acquisition. This intervention includes: (1) an integrated web-based panel management tool called PrEP-Rx, which provides structured HIV risk assessment, automates reminders for laboratory testing and appointments, and reports patients' history of PrEP use; and (2) a centralized PrEP coordination overseen by a clinical support staff (referred to as the PrEP coordinator) who can identify individuals at high risk for HIV through direct patient contact or by reviewing registries for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and who can support multiple HCPs. We propose the following aims: Primary Aim: Evaluate the efficacy of the PrEP optimization intervention (PrEP Coordinator + PrEP-Rx) to increase PrEP prescriptions through a stepped-wedge design among 10 primary care clinics. We hypothesize that the mean number of prescriptions issued will be significantly higher when the clinics use the PrEP intervention versus when they do not. Secondary Aims: 1- Explore differences in PrEP initiation, duration of use, and reasons for discontinuation based on patient's  age, race/ethnicity, and sex/gender, and by clinic and HCP characteristics among study clinics. 2- Explore sustainability of the intervention during an eight-month follow-up after the stepped-wedge Phase. 3- Investigate facilitators and barriers of PrEP delivery and experiences with the proposed PrEP intervention  through qualitative interviews with HCPs, PrEP Coordinators, and clinic directors of study clinics.  The combination of the PrEP Coordinator plus PrEP-Rx has the potential to improve all steps of the PrEP continuum and enhance overall care by identifying individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition, standardizing HIV risk assessment, helping in PrEP initiation, systematizing follow-up visits or laboratory assessments, and educating HCPs about emerging PrEP data. These goals can have a significant public health impact and be attained with minimal burden on existing clinic resources. We are using innovative approaches for PrEP delivery which will result in training of HCPs to increase the number of HCPs capable of offering PrEP. Ultimately, the proposed research has the potential to reduce gaps in the PrEP cascade."
"9276932","Project Summary/Abstract  Cilia have sparked phenomenal interest in the past decade, after the realization that they are a fundamental cellular organelle required for signaling. Untangling the specific mechanisms that regulate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling within the cilium is difficult since so many mutants that disrupt ciliogenesis also affect Shh signaling. We have identified several mouse mutants disrupting cilia-related genes and Shh signaling using forward genetic screens aimed at identifying novel genes or new alleles of known genes that direct neural patterning. Our general strategy is to characterize the in vivo phenotype and then derive cell lines from the mutant mice to define cellular phenotypes. With knowledge gleaned from our colleagues in biochemistry and human genetics, we test mutant versions of the proteins, and then select some for in vivo modeling. Employing exactly this strategy, we have long focused on a small ciliary GTPase, Arl13b, that we hypothesize integrates the regulation of ciliogenesis and Hh signaling through distinct effectors and their downstream pathways. As a GTPase, single basepair mutations within the GTPase domain of Arl13b are predicted to disrupt individual effector pathways. Indeed, we have defined an Arl13b point mutation that disrupts the role of Arl13b in ciliogenesis but leaves the Shh response intact, indicating that the processes can be genetically uncoupled. In the next five years, using ARL13B mutants, a series of cell-based assays, and cell lines in which we can circumvent ciliogenesis or sensitize Hh disruption, we plan to unravel Arl13b function in ciliogenesis, cilia maintenance, traffic of proteins to/within cilia, and Shh signal transduction at unprecedented resolution. We expect Arl13b mutants will provide a genetic entry point from which we will identify at least a subset of effector proteins and define their mechanisms of action. The work in cell culture will enable us to select specific ARL13B mutants for which we can generate mouse models and bring our work full circle back to in vivo phenotypic characterization. In addition, we are integrating the novel alleles we discovered into our analysis. Thus, our proposal will generate a molecular genetic toolkit from which the field will be poised to distinguish the regulation of cilia from that of Hh signaling. This is important to our fundamental understanding of cilia, ciliogenesis, and cilia structure, as well as our basic comprehension of the Shh pathway."
"9370753","ABSTRACT The hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the production of antibodies to nuclear antigens such as ribonucleoproteins and DNA. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and/or chromatin represent an important transition from benign to overt clinical SLE and may predict flares and the severity of tissue damage. The mechanisms of tolerance to chromatin/DNA and of its breakdown in SLE are poorly understood. We explored these mechanisms by focusing on DNASE1L3, a unique secreted DNase whose null mutations are associated with an early-onset familial SLE. Our studies showed that chromatin in microparticles derived from apoptotic cells represented a specific substrate of DNASE1L3 in vitro and in vivo. They also demonstrated that the chromatin and/or other antigens were exposed on the surface of microparticles and recognized by autoantibodies in a DNASE1L3-sensitive manner. We hypothesize that DNASE1L3-sensitive DNA/protein complexes on microparticles are important self-antigens in human SLE, and that that DNASE1L3 can be used to target them for therapeutic purposes. The collaborative nature of the project and unique patient samples and technologies available from our co-investigators will be leveraged to develop and test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, the incidence and clinical relevance of antibodies to DNASE1L3-sensitive antigens in SLE patients will be explored. In Aim 2, DNASE1L3-sensitive antigens on microparticles and the antibodies targeting them will be characterized at the molecular level. In Aim 3, the utility of DNASE1L3 as a therapeutic agent will be tested in animal models of SLE. Collectively, these studies would provide insights into the origin and mechanisms of the pathogenic responses to DNA and associated antigens in human SLE, and facilitate novel approaches towards their therapeutic blockade."
"9442143","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk for internalizing symptoms?which are the leading burden of disease worldwide among children?and their families are at greater risk of experiencing family conflict and marital discord. However, researchers have not systematically investigated the link between lower quality family relationships and children's internalizing symptoms. Moreover, there is also a knowledge gap in how heterogeneity in ASD symptom severity may place some children with ASD at increased risk for internalizing symptoms. These knowledge gaps are critical because, until they are filled, society's ability to understand the complexities of, and ultimately prevent, comorbid internalizing symptoms will remain beyond reach. The long-term goal is to reduce the rates of comorbid internalizing symptoms in children with ASD. The objective in this application is to explicate the longitudinal link between family relationships?which are often affected in families raising a child with ASD?and children's comorbid internalizing symptoms. The central hypothesis is that accounting for heterogeneity in ASD symptom severity and investigating children's responses to negative family interactions will increase understanding of how and for whom lower quality family relationships pose a risk for internalizing symptoms. The rationale for the proposed research is that its successful completion will contribute new knowledge critical for developing interventions that are targeted toward children most at risk for elevated comorbid internalizing symptoms and address mechanisms most salient for children with ASD. The following two specific aims will be pursued: 1) Identify those children with ASD who are most vulnerable to exhibiting comorbid internalizing symptoms in the context of lower quality family relationships based on ASD symptom severity; and 2) Identify the extent to which mechanisms underlying the longitudinal association between lower quality family relationships and comorbid internalizing symptoms, previously identified in typically-developing children, extend to children with ASD, and the extent to which ASD symptom severity moderates these relations. The PIs' preliminary data indicates strong feasibility of recruiting a heterogeneous sample of children with variability in ASD symptom severity, and assessing children's responses to family interactions. Building on this data, 130 children with ASD and their parents will participate in a two-wave longitudinal study over 6 months. Teachers will complete an online survey about the child at each wave. The approach is innovative because it examines heterogeneity in ASD symptom severity as a key moderating variable for identifying those children with ASD most at risk for elevated comorbid internalizing symptoms, and in comparison to the status quo of research in this area, the study utilizes a longitudinal, multi-method, multi-informant design. The proposed research is significant because this knowledge is expected to have translational importance in the prevention of internalizing symptoms in children with ASD."
"9470027","Abstract: The rewarding properties of social interaction are critical for the development of adaptive social relationships. Because the social behavior of males and females evolved in response to very different selective pressures the neural mechanisms mediating social behavior are likely sexually differentiated. A critical gap in our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the expression of social behavior is an understanding of the basic neural mechanisms underlying social reward, particularly in females. Dysfunctions in the mechanisms mediating social reward play a major role in many psychiatric disorders [1-3]. Furthermore, sex differences in the mechanisms mediating social reward likely contribute to the well known, but little understood sex differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders [10,11]. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate sex differences in the neural mechanisms mediating social reward. Although the neural circuitry mediating social reward has not been fully elucidated, an essential component is the mesolimbic dopamine system (MDS). Our lab has very recently shown that oxytocin (OT) receptors in the ventral tegmental area are essential for social reward in male hamsters. Several lines of evidence suggest the MDS is sexually differentiated and I now have strong preliminary data that OT injected into the VTA increases the rewarding properties of social interaction in males, but decreases the rewarding properties of social interaction in females. This proposal will critically test the overarching hypothesis that there are major sex differences in the neural mechanisms mediating social reward. More specifically, I propose that these sex differences in social reward are the result of sex differences in the effects of OT in the ventral tegmental area. The proposed studies will improve our understanding of sex differences in the mechanisms underlying social reward and will provide an outstanding opportunity for research training."
"9386101","Project Summary IFGeneRA Project 3 Whilst approaches to the feedback of individual genetic research results in African genomics research are changing, there are a number of important practical and ethical challenges that need to be considered before African genomics researchers can develop meaningful genomic returns policies. These relate to the absence of a clear understanding of a) the scope of the problem, b) the financial impact of a returns policy on research, and c) a normative account of the impact of resource restrictions on researcher obligations to return study results. In this component of our Collaborative Centre, we combine bioinformatics, health economics and normative ethical enquiry to generate greater insight into the scope, likely impact, and normative obligations for feeding back individual genetic findings in African genomics research. In addition, and in an attempt to bring together the work of the entire Collaborative Centre, we will conduct a continent-wide survey study in which we integrate insights from all three projects to explore their wider acceptability. Our study aims are the following: Aim 1: to generate practical evidence about the scope and likely financial impact of decisions to return individual genetic research results to participants in genomics research in Cameroon and Botswana. Under Aim 1, we will follow a staged research design to a) generate a list of reportable pathogenic findings pertinent to African populations, b) explore how often these variants are found in existing H3Africa WES datasets, and c) investigate the budget implications that feeding back these findings would have for two genomic studies. Aim 2: to develop a normative account of obligations to (not) feedback individual genetic findings for researchers in low- and middle income countries and how these obligations play out in the context of resource-restrained healthcare and research settings. Under Aim 2, we will conduct a literature study followed by normative analysis to understand the ethical obligations for returning results for research for African researchers. Aim 3: To explore the views of people involved in developing, implementing or applying return of results policies across the African continent, drawing on the findings from all projects in the IFGeneRA ELSI Collaborative Centre. Under Aim 3, we will develop a survey based on the insights generated throughout the IFGeneRA projects (1- 3), and send this survey to pertinent stakeholders across the African continent."

Simmons Cancer Center  Population Science and Cancer Control Scientific Program  Project Summary/Abstract  A developing research program in the 2009 application, the Population Science and Cancer Control (PS)  Scientific Program has grown substantially in peer-reviewed funding from less than $500,000 to $5.6 million in  2013. Of that amount, $2.5 million represents funding from the NCI, $1.5 million from other NIH divisions, and  close to $1 million from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Total prevention and  screening projects from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) currently totals $2.4  million.  Intra-programmatic collaborations are strong, representing 44% of the Program's 2013 publications; 13% are  inter-programmatic. Program members meet quarterly for updates and research presentations, with topic-  focused bi-monthly works-in-progress sessions. Our large catchment area is the Dallas-Ft. Worth statistical  metropolitan area, with a special focus on uninsured Dallas county residents cared for by the Parkland Health  and Hospital System . Thus, the program has a heavy focus on cancer disparities and conducts research  among large numbers of traditionally underserved individuals. To address the needs of this catchment area,  the PS Program functions along the following themes:  Theme 1: Cancer prevention research includes study of biomarkers and behaviors  1.a. Biomarkers for colon and hepatocellular cancers  1.b. Risk prevention behaviors  Theme 2: Screening for early detection of colon, hepatocellular, and esophageal cancers  2.a. Population-based screening for colon cancer  2.b. Screening for hepatocellular cancer  2.c. Screening for esophageal cancer  Theme 3: Survivorship (Developing)  We have focused on programmatic grants allowing for discoveries across processes of care that can be  translated into improved care in our catchments' health systems. Sixteen of 24 members have been recruited  to Dallas since the arrival of Co-Leader Dr. Celette Sugg Skinner in 2007: six PhDs in the Department of  Clinical Sciences with strong and diverse skills in mixed-methods, geo-spatial, biomedical, and multi-level  research; a psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry; five MDs in the Department of Medicine with  expertise in clinical epidemiology and health services research; and four PhDs in cancer-related health  promotion and epidemiology in the UT School of Public Health's Dallas Campus."
"9341021","Because male circumcision (MC) reduces the risk of female-to-male HIV-1 transmission by up to 60%, nearly 10.4 million voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) procedures were performed in sub- Saharan Africa where the HIV epidemic is most concentrated. VMMC is safe: the average rate of moderate and severe adverse events (AEs) at the country level is 0.8%, corresponding to 99% of men healing without incident. To reach the global target of 20 million by 2018, VMMC productivity needs to double in countries already plagued by severe healthcare worker shortages like Zimbabwe. The ZAZIC consortium partners with the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) and performed over 120,000 VMMCs. Current VMMC care in Zimbabwe requires in-person, follow-up visits at post-operative days 2,7, and 42. Over 95% adhere to multiple follow-up visits within 14 days of VMMC. ZAZIC?s program has an overall AE rate of 0.4%; therefore, overstretched clinic staff conducted more than 200,000 unnecessary reviews for VMMC clients without complications. High mobile phone ownership, severe healthcare worker shortages, and rapid VMMC scale up make ZAZIC?s VMMC program an ideal setting to test a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to reduce provider workload while safeguarding patient safety. Through an un-blinded, prospective, randomized, control trial (RCT) in high-volume facilities providing VMMC, ZAZIC will implement an interactive, two-way texting (2wT) intervention to identify men healing without complication, allowing them to decline routine in-person follow up visits. 2wT will simultaneously identify men with any sign of an adverse event, encouraging rapid in-person follow-up when an AE is suspected on any day, reducing unnecessary visits while maintaining quality care. We aim to 1) determine if 2wT can safely reduce VMMC follow-up visits; 2) estimate the cost savings associated with 2wT over routine VMMC follow-up; and 3) assess the acceptability and feasibility of 2wT for further scale-up. It is expected that this intervention with be as safe as routine care while providing distinct advantages in terms of efficiency, costs, and reduced healthcare worker burden. This approach is innovative as it focuses on using a low-cost mHealth intervention to reduce provider workload without deterioration in quality care. The success of this intervention could lead to adoption of this intervention at the national level, increasing efficiency of VMMC scale up and reducing burdens on providers and patients. ZAZIC?s international, interdisciplinary team will build the capacity among local research colleagues and MoHCC collaborators, helping the Zimbabwean team become future leaders in mHealth research."
"9345314","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engineering vascularized bone tissue for scaffolding repairing remains a significant clinical problem. One major challenge is to develop systematic models based on coordinated experiments. The second challenge is to understand the underlying mechanisms of the synergistic effects of the temporal combinations of growth factor cues. The third challenge in bone tissue engineering is the establishment of a well functional vascular network. In order to address these challenges, we plan to take advantage of our expertise in biomaterials, cell biology and computational modeling to develop coherent experimental protocols, material engineering and multi-scale mathematical models for systematically optimizing bone regeneration (called sBone system). This bone repairing process is likely under the control of many complex pathways. Using the classical BMP-2/IGF-1 dual-growth-factor temporal combination system as the biological model, our systems biology research, led to the hypothesis that BMP-2 induces Smad1/2 signaling pathways of MSCs, gradually remodels the expression pattern of Runx2 and Osx pathways, and thus sensitizes MSCs to the late IGF-1 cue. We will first develop in-vitro multi-temporal scale model for optimal temporal combinations of growth factors to promote bone regeneration, and conduct in-silico screening using the model and in-vitro validation of candidate growth factor combinations. Second, we will develop a predictive multi-scale model of bone regeneration within the novel pre-vascularized macro-porous, biodegradable beta-tricalcium phosphate (?-TCP) based scaffolds loaded with the programmed growth factor release system. And finally we will guide the design of the chemo-physical features of bone scaffolds by in-silico optimization of growth factor release profiles and the geometric parameters of the macro-pores. Through integration of in silico and experimental analyses, we will be able to use systems biology approaches to optimize the temporal combinations of growth factor release from the engineering vessel grafted 3D scaffolds for successful in-vivo bone regeneration."
"9483859","PROJECT SUMMARY  Telomere length and telomerase activity have been posited as biomarkers for cellular aging, longevity, and age-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Their role in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, however, is still not well-defined, as they have been shown to also be influenced by adiposity. Moreover, information on the role of genetics in telomere biology is scarce. The objectives of the proposed study are to explore the phenotypic and genotypic relationship between body composition measures (e.g., obesity) and telomere length and telomerase activity, and to investigate the role of telomere length and telomerase activity on metabolic risk factors and disease in adults.  Using a longitudinal study design, we propose to measure serial leukocyte telomere length (LTL) from already existing stored (n=4,204) and newly collected (n=1,000) buffy coat samples in 1,794 Fels Longitudinal Study participants ranging in age from 18-93 years. Fels Longitudinal Study participants have been repeatedly measured over their entire lifetime for body composition and metabolic markers. Over time, more advanced measures of body composition such as visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adiposity using MRI, and novel blood chemistries such as inflammatory markers have been also been collected. Whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are available on a large subset of these participants to search for genes influencing telomere biology. This uniquely valuable cohort presents a readily available, cost-effective, and powerful resource for understanding the relationship between telomere biology and cardiometabolic health.  The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) to examine longitudinal associations between adiposity traits, telomere length, and metabolic risk in 1,794 adults, 2) to examine cross-sectional relationships between newly collected telomerase activity, telomere length, adiposity traits, and metabolic risk factors in a subset (N=1,000) of participants, and 3) to identify genetic variants influencing telomere length and telomerase activity and to use Mendelian Randomization to examine causal associations among obesity, telomere biology and metabolic risk in a subset (N=1,247) of study participants.  The results of this proposed study will provide important information about how telomere biology is linked to obesity, aging, and cardiometabolic disease risk. Further, this information will aid in the assessment of risk, prevention and treatment of accelerated aging and chronic disease."
"9479643","Genetic approaches have been successful in identifying causal genetic factors, both common and rare, that contribute to risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), providing a crucial starting point for mechanistic neurobiological investigations. However, moving towards an integrated mechanistic understanding of ASD at a molecular, cellular, and circuit level faces substantial challenges, such as extreme genetic heterogeneity and the lack of causal frameworks with which to connect different levels of analysis of nervous system function in model systems or patients. Nearly a decade ago, we reasoned that gene and protein networks would provide an organizing framework for understanding heterogeneous psychiatric disease genetic risk in a unified context and inform disease modeling; indeed there is now substantial evidence supporting convergence of major effect risk genes during mid-fetal cortical development. Furthermore, related functional genomic studies, including in those with a major gene form of ASD (dup)15q11-13, show shared patterns of transcriptional and chromatin dysregulation in post-mortem ASD brain, further supporting biological convergence. Where and how this occurs, and what biological mechanism(s) it reflects is not known. To address this, we propose an ambitious project that addresses several major challenges in establishing causal linkages between genetic risk and CNS structure and function in ASD. The work proposed in this multi-PI U01 involves a team of four principal investigators and co-investigators from UCLA and Stanford with the expertise necessary to perform this work using state of the art methodologies, ranging from developing and characterizing in vitro models of human brain development, stem cells, physiology, genomics, physics, and behavior. Through close collaboration, we will develop and analyze in vitro human stem cell based models that are differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells and assembled into organized 3D brain cultures called human forebrain spheroids (hFS). These hFS contain the major cell classes of the developing forebrain, including progenitors, radial glia, cortical interneurons, glutamatergic neurons, and non-reactive astrocytes, and form functional synapses. We will model the effects of six major effect ASD risk loci in hFS with molecular, genomic, and physiological analyses to assess convergence at each level of analysis. We will also conduct comparisons of physiology using three rodent models based on the same genes modeled in vitro with the aim of integrating phenotypes to develop predictive models and compare with in vivo rodent models. We will analyze the relationship of molecular alterations and basic cellular and synaptic features with potential emergent or dynamic network features in control-derived hFS and compare these features with hFS harboring ASD risk mutations and test a subset of causal relationships based on network model predictions. Completion of these aims will lead to a more clear understanding of the power and limitations of model systems and computational models, while uncovering potential areas of convergence in different genetic forms of ASD."
"9434626","ABSTRACT It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that the chromosomal contacts created by the three- dimensional (3D) organization of the genome are critical in the regulation of gene expression. Disruption of this structure has been strongly implicated in the vast alterations in gene expression that are observed in many cancers, and there is increasing evidence that alterations in chromatin structure surrounding key oncogenes, such as myc, may be of significant importance in both driving oncogenesis and in sustaining disease. Despite this knowledge, it remains unclear whether alterations in chromatin structure are a cause or a consequence of alterations in transcriptional activity. This is in large part due to a limited availability of tools to study single chromatin contacts. Reported methods for forcibly looping distant genomic regions have frequently involved either gross alterations of the linear DNA sequence or are technically challenging and demand significant prior knowledge of loop-mediating factors. To address these issues, I have developed a novel technology for chromatin loop re-organization using CRISPR-dCas9 (CLOuD9) that allows for a versatile, targeted, and reversible manipulation of chromatin contacts. I have demonstrated the utility of CLOuD9 to modulate gene expression in human cells, and plan to further utilize it to investigate how differential enhancer contacts can regulate expression of myc in breast and ovarian cancer (BOC). I hypothesize that alteration of the chromatin contacts surrounding the myc locus is sufficient to alter myc expression, and thereby impact the development and progression of these cancers. In the future, I plan to investigate the mechanisms by which dysregulation of chromatin structure contributes to acquired chemoresistance on a genome-wide scale. Collectively, findings from this body of work will be critical to obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of how chromatin dynamics specifically impact transcription apparatus to facilitate oncogenesis, and may further shed light on useful ways to design novel therapies for more targeted cancer treatments."
"9308101","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Single particle tracking (SPT) is a powerful class of techniques for understanding biomolecular motion at the subcellular level in the crowded environments of the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. The basic scheme is to acquire image sequences, typically through wide-?eld ?uorescence imaging, produce trajectories from these images, and ?nally to estimate motion parameters from the trajectories through the use of tools such as curve-?tting to the mean-square displacement (MSD) curve. The method has been extremely effective for the study of single particles moving in the plane under a ?xed model. SPT will have a transformative impact once it is capable of studying biological macromolecules moving in three dimensions and undergoing complex modes of motion that switch between different models during a single run as particles undergo, for example, internalization, recycling, and traf?cking between cells. In the 3-D setting, the assumptions that make the standard methods both simple and robust no longer hold and issues such as motion blur, ad hoc choices of ?tting parameters that have a large impact on the accuracy of results, an assumption of stationarity in the data which precludes analysis of mode switching in a single trajectory, separation of the analysis of particle trajectory from motion parameter estimation, and lack of modeling of effects of non-Gaussian noise must be addressed and overcome to make SPT as effective in 3-D as it has been in studying planar motion.  The proposed project consists of three speci?c aims. The ?rst is focused on creating techniques for jointly estimating particle trajectory and motion parameters from SPT data sets using a framework that allows for complex motion and observation models, including camera-speci?c descriptions, depth-dependent point spread functions, and dynamics that switch between different models. The resulting method will greatly improve the accuracy and applicability of SPT in the 3-D setting. The second aim targets data acquisition, using a confocal- based tracking scheme inspired by nonlinear, stochastic extremum-seeking control. The confocal modality provides a better SNR, innate 3-D capability and, most signi?cantly, an extremely fast sampling rate to miti- gate effects of motion blur. The proposed method, implementable on standard confocal instruments, is tunable for optimal performance at different experimental settings and complements wide-?eld techniques when high temporal resolution of a single particle is needed. Finally, the third aim seeks to validate the proposed tech- niques in two experimental systems. The ?rst is a simple setting of tracking quantum dots inside hydrogels. These polymer-based systems are extensively used in a number of biomedical applications, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, and immunoisolation. The second setting is that of tracking individual, labeled AMPA receptors in rat hippocampal neurons, providing a biological setting for validation and demonstration."
"9469962","Abstract _ Approximately 51% of people over the age of 12 are drinkers (120 million), and of these current users, 13.9% have met the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Severe AUD is a chronic, relapsing psychiatric disorder that is characterized by the emergence of negative emotional states (e.g., dysphoria, anxiety, pain) and the development of negative motivational symptoms (e.g., escalation of drug intake and compulsive drug seeking). This transition from recreational, limited intake to uncontrolled, escalated intake is proposed to involve a transition from positive to negative reinforcement mechanisms for seeking alcohol. Accordingly, alcohol may be sought after and taken in excessive amounts to alleviate the negative, withdrawal-related symptoms. Our rodent model of alcohol dependence reliably demonstrates escalated alcohol drinking and alcohol seeking during withdrawal. Importantly, we have also identified the emergence of significant pain hypersensitivity (or hyperalgesia) in dependent animals, which may serve as a key negative reinforcement mechanism. During alcohol withdrawal, the robust escalation of drinking and hyperalgesia in dependent animals is associated with an increase in central brain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, a key mediator of stress responsiveness. Importantly, systemic GR antagonism via mifepristone reduces alcohol-mediated hyperalgesia as well as escalated drinking in both preclinical animal models as well as early clinical trials. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the convergence of central nociceptive and alcohol-seeking biobehavioral mechanisms in promoting and/or maintaining the alcohol-dependent state. Our preliminary work has identified an increase in GR phosphorylation within the cingulate cortex of alcohol-dependent rats, and we hypothesize a specific role for increased cingulate glucocorticoid activity in the promotion of both excessive drinking and hyperalgesia. This proposal will provide a promising PhD student with vital research training through studies that use an integrative approach to test the predictions that: 1) alcohol dependence-related escalation of drinking and hyperalgesia is mediated by GR signaling within the cingulate, and 2) alcohol dependence-related potentiation of in GR activity in the cingulate cortex is localized to ?pro-nociceptive? excitatory pyramidal neurons and can be attenuated with mifepristone-mediated GR antagonism. These experiments will train a future independent scientist in the functional analysis of candidate mechanisms underlying alcohol dependence and chronic pain. The results of these studies will provide a greater understanding of the neurobiology of alcohol use disorder and an emerging therapeutic, and will additionally contribute to the development of effective treatment strategies for comorbid AUD and pain, leading to improvements in health and decreased morbidity of affected individuals."
"9413678","To most powerfully organize unique resources for our Core Center for Clinical Research (CCCR), we propose a Resource Core, Assessment & Intervention Science & Technology in Daily Life (ASSIST-Daily Life), which will integrate 3 Sub-Cores: Person-Centered Outcomes Assessment and Technology (PCOAT); Accelerometer Measurement of Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Sleep (AMPASS); and Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BIT). Each Sub-Core brings specific expertise, technologies, and critical resources, including: for PCOAT, identification of measures capitalizing on newer item-response theory based approaches, psychometric evaluation of measures under consideration, assessment technology, training in assessment implementation, analysis of outcome measures including measure performance; for AMPASS, selection of accelerometers and training to assess physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, protocols for valid monitoring, algorithms to transform raw data into meaningful parameters, development of accelerometer-based interventions, integration of accelerometer-based output into technology platforms; for BIT, intervention and software design and development to deliver and evaluate behavioral interventions, including mobile, web, tablet, and sensor-based technologies that aid behavior change to support health, mental health, and wellness. Tailored to our Center's burgeoning body of work from epidemiologic studies that identified targets, this Core will help us to move forward to the development of prevention strategies and interventions against these targets, our CCCR theme. ASSIST-Daily Life will provide innovative support particularly because the Sub- Cores will operate as an integrated unit. ASSIST-Daily Life Resource Core aims are, for research efforts relevant to persons with or at risk for rheumatic diseases and musculoskeletal conditions: 1) design tailored, state-of-the-science, multi-modal assessment and health interventions, incorporating real-world: self-report of social, physical, and mental health, symptoms, and life satisfaction; performance-based assessment of motor, sensory, and cognitive function; accelerometer monitoring to assess physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep; mobile, web, tablet, and sensor-based applications that identify real-world behavioral markers using GPS, activity logs, and wearable biosensors, to predict physiological and psychological states; 2) implement technology platforms (off-the-shelf and customized) that can deploy health interventions and administer multi- modal assessment, integrating into the platform, as relevant to the project, self-report and performance-based assessment and accelerometer assessment in daily life. ASSIST-Daily Life will: enable CCCR investigators to conduct their funded projects more efficiently and effectively; support development of proposals for novel new projects; improve quality, rigor, and cost-effectiveness vs. studies without such a Core; provide critical infrastructure to support sharing of this unique resource; and attract investigators from other fields to our CCCR theme by offering this integrated resource which could not be duplicated without great expense."
"9386344","Summary The Shared Bioinformatics Core that is proposed to support the Projects of SickleGenAfrica addresses a critical problem in the effort to generate new insights into pathogenesis of organ damage in sickle cell disease populations in Africa: namely access to a high throughput and high quality genome scanning and analysis center that is deeply experienced in GWAS. The leader of this Core has processed and analyzed tens of thousands of genotyping arrays, led large consortia in the form of the U54 mechanism (as Chairman of the NIH Neuroscience Microarray Consortium), and provided new insights into pathobiology that have been published in journals such as Cell, Nature Genetics, NEJM, and Science. The key critical barrier that the Core solves is access to deep experience with genome scanning and analysis. When the aims of this Shared Core are achieved, we will have generated a training set of data that will be used to identify novel correlations between small ancient haplotype blocks and several SCD-related phenotypes. More generally, this data will be used to refine locations of causative variants, and also form a component of a collaborative data set that informs genomic architecture from across the African continent. These new insights into predisposition alleles will enable a more refined understanding of the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction that the Projects are focused on, which can then be parlayed into risk screening or targeted therapeutic development. The successful completion of the aims of this Core will utilize new technology, the H3Africa array, which is the latest innovation in array design specific to African populations, derived from both public and private sequencing data sets. This new and most comprehensive view of the ancient African genomes derived from the work in this Core will allow us to get unprecedented resolution into the variants that are correlated to, and enhance risk for, some of the most prevalent complications of SCD, which may form the basis for new diagnostic and therapeutic development. Importantly, the Core leader has led the field in translation and commercialization of such new insights in the form of products/companies (such as Navigenics) that deliver solutions to the population, connecting the dots from taxpayer funded basic research, and is a differentiator of this Core."
"9352421","Many Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) veterans experience chronic pain, which is worsened by co-morbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Significantly, there is an unmet clinical need to provide effective treatments for chronic pain. One hurdle for the development of new therapies is a lack of understanding which neurotransmitters and brain circuits are responsible for the persistence of chronic pain. Thus, this career development application will provide the necessary training to develop an independent VA scientist capable of researching novel brain circuitry responsible for the development of stress-induced chronic pain.  OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to identify the brain circuitry responsible for persistent stress- induced pain and comorbid behaviors using targeted brain manipulations, including optogenetic techniques. The overarching hypothesis is that stress induces imbalanced signaling within the limbic brain circuitry to produce persistent pain hypersensitivity.  RESEARCH PLAN: This project will utilize two interrelated, independent specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that stress-induced increases corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex leads to persistent visceral and somatic pain-like behaviors. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that an imbalance in signaling between limbic brain regions, regulated by corticotropin-releasing factor and glutamatergic receptors, is responsible for chronic stress-induced hypersensitivity. We will use a combination of targeted stereotaxic surgeries, cannula implantations, drug microinfusions, and laser stimulation to modify nociceptive, anxiety-like, and depression-like behaviors in conscious, freely moving rats.  TRAINING PLAN: Through his mentoring team and consultants, the candidate will receive training on how to conduct the optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies needed to address the research plan. Additionally, the candidate will take formal courses to promote his professional development, including responsible conduct of research, statistical analysis, and laboratory management. With formal mentorship to improve his written and oral communication, the candidate will be able to present the findings of this research at national and international meetings and publish the results in quality journals.  ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The research in Aim 1 will demonstrate that stress-induces increases in corticotropin-releasing factor expression within the medial prefrontal cortex leading to enhanced visceral and somatic sensitivity, which signals through corticotropin-releasing factor receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to produce the behaviors. Specific Aim 2 will show using optogenetic activation that activation of amygdala terminals or inhibition of medial prefrontal cortex terminals in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis will produce visceral and somatic hypersensitivity in non-stressed rats. The experiments will also demonstrate that inhibiting amygdala signaling (corticotropin-releasing factor) while stimulating medial prefrontal cortex signaling (glutamate) in chronically stressed rats will inhibit pain-like behaviors. Completion of these Specific Aims, along with the proposed mentoring and training, will ensure that the candidate develops his research skills to submit a future VA Merit grant and eventually becomes a life-long VA Research Career Scientist.  SIGNIFICANCE TO VETERANS HEALTH: Scientifically, the results from this project will identify a novel stress-associated brain circuit, along with the specific neurotransmitters, that modulates chronic pain. Identification of the mechanisms and circuitry involved in chronic stress-induced pain could lead to new targets for therapies to treat veterans experiencing chronic pain, which is a significant unmet healthcare burden. Professionally, this career development award will produce an independent scientist with the capability of investigating chronic pain mechanisms to provide additional tools to improve the quality-of-life for veterans."
"9406039","Pain is a common co-morbidity for HIV-infected patients. Prevalence studies suggest that, on average, half of all HIV-infected persons suffer pain. Chronic pain can lead to heavy alcohol use among HIV-infected persons, which may in turn be a barrier to treatment/control of HIV and contribute to spread of HIV. Thus there is an urgent need to address pain among persons with HIV. Opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and nalmefene, which are licensed for treatment of alcohol use disorders, show promise as being effective and safe treatments for chronic pain among persons with HIV. This study will pilot test novel pharmacotherapies (opioid receptor antagonists) to improve chronic pain among HIV-infected heavy drinkers, and will explore the hypothesis that the mechanism of action for improving pain is through decreased inflammation. The specific aims of the research are: UH2/Aim 1: To assess the feasibility, tolerability and safety of using opioid receptor antagonists (low-dose naltrexone and nalmefene) to treat pain among HIV-infected persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain; UH3/Aim 2: to perform a 3-arm pilot randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of low-dose naltrexone and nalmefene vs. placebo among HIV-infected persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain to provide estimates of their effects on: 1) pain (both self-reported and experimental/cold pressor test; 2) inflammation (i.e., levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-?); and 3) measures of HIV control (CD4 count and viral load). The results of this study will provide preliminary information (tolerability, effect size, etc.) to design a larger RCT of low-dose naltrexone and/or nalmefene for chronic pain among persons with heavy alcohol use. We choose to conduct this research in St. Petersburg, Russia, given that: 1) nalmefene is licensed in Russia, but not currently in the US; 2) patients are seldom on chronic opioids (which are contraindicated to use with opioid receptor antagonists) due to the unavailability of opioid agonist therapy for addiction and restricted use of opioids for pain; and 3) a high prevalence of heavy drinking and HIV exists in Russia. Addressing chronic pain is a high priority for patients with HIV, and therefore this application is highly ?patient-centered? as well as innovative. Given the US epidemic of opioid use disorders, new pharmacotherapies without addictive potential are desperately needed for HIV-infected persons with chronic pain and alcohol problems."
"9336989","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The system that controls smooth pursuit eye movements is one of the most accessible, promising systems for understanding how neural circuits transform sensory inputs into actions. Pursuit is a natural, ecologically- relevant behavir that allows primates to track moving objects of interest in the visual world. Now-classical analyses relating neural activity to behavior have already provided insights about the systems-level functions and computations of the pursuit circuit that perhaps exceed our understanding of all other voluntary behaviors in mammals. Despite these successes, there are large gaps in our understanding of the pursuit system. We seek a new level in understanding the circuit by measuring and manipulating the activity of large populations of identified neurons in the key sensory and prefrontal cortical areas. We intend to address how different neuronal types function during pursuit, how they implement systems-level computations within micro- and meso-circuits, and how control centers select the appropriate sensory data given cognitive factors. These questions, although stated in the context of the pursuit system, are instances of the more general problem of how population activity in large numbers of sensory neurons is parsed and converted into appropriate behaviors. The time is now ripe to take advantage of several technical and conceptual revolutions: Specifically, we propose to study the neural basis of pursuit eye movements in marmosets, in which cortical areas responsible for motion sensation and target selection are easily accessed and for which genomic toolboxes are being generated. We will investigate the functional circuitry at multiple scales using a combination of 2-photon calcium imaging and large-scale extracellular array electrophysiology, cell-type identification and optogenetic perturbation, and dynamical systems modeling."
"9405968","ABSTRACT  Project 5 Co-Development of Skills Associated with Learning Difficulties/Disabilities in Monolingual and  Bilingual Children The successful acquisition of reading and math skills during elementary school represents one of the most significant educational achievements of early education. These skills provide the foundation for acquiring knowledge both in school and throughout life. Many children acquire these skills early and maintain them at a high level throughout school. A significant number of children, however, struggle with reading skills, math skills, or both throughout their school experiences, resulting in learning difficulties and disabilities. Two factors that may affect development and co-development of reading and math are self-regulation and non-mainstream language environments (i.e., children from homes in which a language other than the societal language is spoken). Whereas prior research has demonstrated associations between these two factors and problems in reading and math, including learning disabilities in these domains, few studies have employed longitudinal designs that allow a determination of the nature and direction of these associations. Consequently, the overall goals of this project are to examine issues related to the development and co-development of learning disabilities and difficulties in reading and math both in the context of self-regulation and in the context of nonmainstream language environments across the early-elementary-school years using longitudinal-study designs that allow better determination of the nature of the associations. Three studies--(a) A longitudinal study of co-development of reading, math, and self-regulation in early elementary school in (primarily) monolingual English-speaking children that builds on one of our current LDRC samples; (b) A longitudinal study of co- development of language, reading-related and, math skills, as well as self-regulation from preschool to 2nd grade with Spanish-speaking English-learners; and (c) An eye-movement study of Spanish-speaking children's reading in English and Spanish to identify lexical and reader characteristics associated with difficulty acquiring meaning from text)--will be used to address five specific aims: (1) Examine how co-development of reading and math skills across the early-elementary-school period is related to success or difficulty in both areas. (2) Identify the influences of self-regulation, indexed by executive function (EF) and behavior in the classroom, on children's reading and math development and co-development across the early-elementary-school period. (3) Explore the co-development of early language, reading, and math skills in Spanish and English for children whose home language is Spanish and examine how early development of these skills relates to developing risk of learning difficulties or disabilities in language, reading, and mathematics in kindergarten through 2nd grade. (4) Determine how the development of self-regulation of Spanish-speaking preschoolers represents risk or protective factors for learning difficulties or disabilities in language, reading, and math in kindergarten through 2nd grade. (5) Identify potential differences in how word- and child-level factors affect children's moment-to-moment reading behaviors (i.e., eye movements) while reading Spanish and English text."
"9377085","Project Summary/Abstract: Technology-dependent children, those who rely on medical equipment such as mechanical ventilation or feeding tubes for daily care at home, are among the sickest and most vulnerable subset of children with complex chronic conditions. They comprise 20% of all children discharged from the hospital to home, yet account for 61% of healthcare spending for children, up to $110 billion annually. An estimated 600,000 children in the United States are technology dependent and live at home, and are cared for primarily by their parents. These parents report greater levels of depressive symptoms and stress than other caregiver groups. In addition, these caregivers report poor psychological and physical health that compromise their caregiving capacity and increase their use of emergency rooms (ER) for their children's care needs. Despite these adverse consequences, there are no interventions to meet the needs of these caregivers and their children. Resourcefulness Training, (cognitive-behavioral self-management intervention) has been shown to improve psychological and physical outcomes, mediate the effects of stress, and enhance the care provided to care- recipients. It will be tested in a randomized trial against an attention-only control arm. The intervention arm will receive an intervention that includes: a face-to-face session for teaching social (help-seeking) and personal (self-help) resourcefulness skills; ongoing access to video vignettes of caregivers of technology-dependent children describing resourcefulness skill application in daily life; 4 weeks of skills' reinforcement using daily journal writing; weekly phone calls for the first 4 weeks; and booster sessions at 2 and 4 months post enrollment. The Attention Control arm will receive weekly phone calls for the first 4 weeks and at 2 and 4 months post enrollment plus any usual care. The aims of the study are to: 1) Determine whether Resourcefulness Training versus Attention Control improves psychological (general mental health, depressive cognitions, depressive symptoms, appraised stress, burden) and physical outcomes (general physical health, chronic stress [hair cortisol]) and family functioning over 6 months in parents of technology-dependent children, after controlling for the parents' race/ethnicity, sex, family income, and children's functional status; and 2) Determine whether changes in psychological and physical outcomes and family functioning are mediated by changes in parents' levels of resourcefulness (personal and social). Our study will be the first to test a resourcefulness intervention for this caregiver population and to include male as well as female caregivers. This intervention is distinctive in that it uses web, telephone, and journal components for reinforcement?not multiple face-to-face visits that can be labor intensive. If shown to be efficacious, it can be easily replicated with other populations with strong potential for translation into practice."

"9567682","Early Phase Clinical Research Support ? Project Summary This renewal is the first time that KUCC is requesting Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) funds and undergoing formal evaluation as a CCSG component. Although this is the first year to request CCSG support, KUCC has been investing heavily to build the infrastructure, facilities, staffing and capabilities for a successful early phase clinical research program. Stephen Williamson, MD, leads the Early Phase Clinical Research program. Long-range strategic planning is focused on short-term, pilot (pre-phase I) and phase I clinical research studies originating from KUCC scientific investigators. Preliminary data generated from these studies are typically challenged by shortages in funding, yet have great potential to serve as the foundation for later phase studies through competitive grants or industry. The Investigator-Initiated Trial Steering Committee will score and prioritize proposed studies for EPCRS funding based on whether the new compound was invented by a KUCC member, a repurposed drug with KUCC pre-clinical data and highly likely to provide preliminary data for further clinical development. In order to be considered, the proposals requesting EPCRS funds must be: 1) high priority, innovative, pilot and phase 0 or I institutional clinical studies focusing on initial testing of a candidate agent or device for the diagnosis, prevention, detection or treatment of cancer; 2) conceptualized/designed by KUCC members; and 3) of short duration (e.g., 1-2 years). If the proposal is selected for EPCR support, the Protocol Review and Monitoring System must approve the study before funding will be released."
"9466361","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and adolescents, killing more pediatric patients every year than any other malignancy. When children with ALL relapse the survival rate is less than 50%, and this has not improved for more than 30 years. Although ALL is less common in adults, it is more deadly, reaching 5-year survival rates of less than 12% in people over 65, an age when tolerance for toxic therapies is poor. The majority of ALL cases in children and adults are the B-cell type (B-ALL) and those with the poorest outcome are characterized by overexpression of the CRLF2 gene (CRLF2 B-ALL). This type of leukemia is particularly devastating in Hispanic children where it occurs 5 times more often than in other children. In adults, CRLF2 B-ALL makes up 1/3 of all B-ALL cases. A safe and effective treatment capable of targeting CRLF2 B-ALL would have a significant health impact in the United States and in Central and South America where rates of CRLF2 B-ALL are even higher. We have discovered a novel biologic that selectively targets the signaling pathway that produces CRLF2 B-ALL while sparing normal immune cells. The proposed studies will establish the therapeutic efficacy of this novel biologic in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of high-risk ALL. Scientific premise: Our preliminary studies show that high physiological levels of the biologic exert an anti-leukemia effect against CRLF2 B-ALL and establish a likely mechanism for these effects. To advance the use of the biologic in clinical trial for the treatment of CRLF2 B-ALL, it is essential to establish the dose and efficacy of the biologic as a single agent and as a part of combination therapy in preclinical studies. The overall objective of the current proposal is to establish proof-of-principle for the use of the biologic and its efficacy in the treatment of high-risk CRLF2 B-ALL. The achieve this objective we will: Aim 1. Establish the dose of biologic required to achieve normal and therapeutic blood plasma levels in PDX mice and Aim 2. Evaluate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the biologic as a single agent and in combination therapy using PDX models of high-risk B-ALL. At the end of the proposed work we will have: 1) Determined the dosing required to generate PDX with normal and therapeutic levels of recombinant human biologic, 2) Assessed in vivo functional effects and toxicity of the biologic, 3) Evaluated the efficacy of the biologic as a single agent in the treatment of CRLF2 B-ALL using PDX models; 4) Evaluated the efficacy of the biologic to prevent relapse and restore normal B cell precursors in combination with standard of care therapy in PDX models of CRLF2 B-ALL. This work has the potential to produce a more effective and less toxic treatment strategy to improve survival in patients with high-risk CRLF2 B-ALL."

With Partnership resources and significant commitment from both institutions, we have established joint programs enhancing basic and clinical research, enriching cancer outreach, expanding cancer education, and creating a unique Hispanic/Latino (H/L) Biobank, leading to the development of a robust network and infrastructure necessary for a sustained long-term collaboration to improve cancer outcomes in the H/L population. The U54 Partnership's immediate impact includes the identification of new mutations in breast and lung cancer in H/L patients, recruitment of new faculty essential for sustainability and growth, and 84 community outreach educational activities for H/Ls in Florida (FL) and Puerto Rico (PR). The development of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) and the training of clinical researchers, with 25 clinical intervention trials activated in Ponce, demonstrate the broad impact realized through the Partnership. Furthermore the Partnership had a critical role in the ACGME re-accreditation of the Hematology/Oncology Fellowship in PR, in the establishment of two stem cell transplant programs in PR by fellows trained in the MCC Bone Marrow Transplant unit, and in the establishment of an ACGME-accredited surgical residency in Ponce with surgical oncology rotations at MCC. The short-term metrics of the first 4 years of the U54 Partnership grant include 48 student participants, 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts published, and 29 grants funded out of a total of 64 submitted.  Our vision for the U54 PACHE renewal is to further grow and engage faculty and students in cancer precision medicine research that directly impacts the H/L populations in FL and PR. The Partnership has the requisite components to fully execute precision medicine in an underserved population?a biobank, quantitative science core (QSC) to analyze data, culturally sensitive outreach materials, expertise in the latest technologies, and a robust research portfolio. The four specific aims for the U54 Partnership renewal are the following. Aim 1: To increase the number of researchers at PHSU focused on basic/translational research in cancer and to augment the number of researchers in cancer health disparities at MCC. This is facilitated with joint projects in ovarian and breast cancer. Aim 2: To further develop outreach programs and research efforts in the H/L communities at both PHSU and MCC. An epidemiological project will examine the impact of receipt of MC1R genotypes on personal sun protection behaviors. Aim 3: To increase support for basic, translational and clinical research in the H/L population by establishing the QSC and further developing the PRBB. The MCC Total Cancer Care protocol will be developed in Ponce hospitals and leveraged by the PRBB to facilitate tissue collection. Aim 4: To provide comprehensive and structured student research education at both PHSU and MCC to facilitate the expansion and success of cancer researchers and clinicians in the H/L population."
"9548053","The mechanism(s) underlying how mutations in emerin, an inner nuclear envelope protein, cause muscle disease remain unknown. Mutations in the gene encoding emerin cause Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD), characterized by progressive skeletal muscle wasting, irregular heart rhythms and tendon contractures. The skeletal muscle phenotype is caused by the failure to regenerate skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle stem cell differentiation requires the coordinated temporal expression of differentiation genes. Disruption of the differentiation transcriptional program causes impaired differentiation. Genomic architecture controls gene activation or repression by regulating the association of the genome with transcriptionally active or repressed nuclear domains. The genome reorganizes itself during differentiation of many cell types to control coordinated temporal gene expression. This reorganization plays fundamental roles in cell fate decisions during stem cell differentiation and in development. The research proposed here will examine how emerin regulates genomic organization and gene expression to regulate the coordinated temporal gene expression required for myogenic differentiation and how this is altered in EDMD. The field lacks a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating nuclear lamina regulation of genomic architecture and its affect on gene expression. The nuclear lamina regulates genomic organization and chromatin architecture. However, the lamins are not required for repressed chromatin localization at the nuclear periphery, suggesting other nuclear envelope proteins mediate their association. We hypothesize emerin is one of these proteins that mediates the association of repressed chromatin with the nuclear envelope. Supporting our hypothesis emerin interacts with repressive chromatin machinery and dynamically interacts with myogenic differentiation gene loci during differentiation; this localization is emerin-dependent. The proposed studies will test how the interaction of emerin with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) establishes or maintains repressive chromatin at the nuclear envelope. Emerin regulation of HDAC3 activity is predicted to regulate genomic reorganization and coordinated temporal expression of differentiation genes during differentiation. Thus we will monitor gene expression during emerin-null myogenic progenitor differentiation to identify molecular pathways disrupted in these cells, which will be confirmed by treatment with activators or inhibitors. EDMD-causing emerin mutant progenitors will be used to confirm these pathways are involved in the impaired differentiation seen in EDMD. These studies will have a significant impact on muscle disease because they analyze specific molecular interactions mediating genomic organization at the nuclear envelope and how their disruption alters transcriptional programing during differentiation and in muscle disease."
"9377501","Project Summary/Abstract Contrary to the widely-held belief that nearly all vertebrate cells have primary cilia, our lab recently discovered that extra-embryonic visceral endoderm cells lack primary cilia. Our lab was also the first to demonstrate that primary cilia are required for all signaling through the Hedgehog pathway in mammals, which is consistent with data that extra-embryonic cells do not respond to Hedgehog ligands. However, extra-embryonic cells do secrete Hedgehog ligands, which are required for normal development of the embryo-derived vasculature of the placenta. I hypothesized that other cell types that make, but do not respond, to Hedgehog ligands may also lack cilia. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that epithelia of a number of adult endodermal organs, which secrete but do not respond to Hedgehog ligands, lack primary cilia. However, I have also found that endodermal epithelia have primary cilia in early development. This primary cilia are present early in gut tube morphogenesis but are lost before adulthood, suggesting that dynamic signals from adjacent tissues can inhibit formation of primary cilia. In the proposed research, I will determine at what point primary cilia are lost in endodermal epithelium, which will allow me to identify the exogenous signals present at this time point. Expression of candidate factors will be manipulated to test whether primary cilia can be ectopically assembled in cells that would normally lack these organelles. I will also test the functional relevance the lack of autocrine hedgehog signaling in these tissue by expressing a constitutively active mutant of Gli2, the major Hedgehog transcriptional activator, in embryonic and adult endodermal epithelium, and assaying its effects on gut development and recovery from gut injury. To find additional factors responsible for inhibition of ciliogenesis, I propose to perform transcriptome analysis of ciliated and non-ciliated endodermal epithelium. I also propose to perform screens to identify small molecules that can induce cilia on non-ciliated extra embryonic visceral endodermal stem cells (XEN), in an effort to find therapeutic targets capable of inducing ectopic ciliogenesis, which may prove invaluable in treatment of a variety of developmental disorders and cancers."

Funding this preclinical  work has been difficult, since there are a number of costs associated with generation of preliminary data which  are often unfunded by external sources. These include purchasing of imaging time; PK/PD studies; pre-and  post-biopsies to assess biomarkers; determining a dosing regimen to be used in a clinical trial; development of  novel imaging probes that provide functional and metabolic information. Early phase investigator-initiated  translational research trials require significant regulatory, data management and research nursing resources  that are not always available through traditional mechanisms in a timely fashion. The primary goals of the  Cancer Center's Early Phase Clinical Research Support is to provide support to Cancer Center members for  innovative pilot or Phase I studies, so as to capitalize on the science being carried out in the scientific  programs. Only protocols which are investigator initiated, based on UTSW science, and likely to result in  Phase II or III studies, will be funded.  In 2013, we strengthened our Phase 1 program by recruiting an experienced Phase 1 Leader, Arthur Frankel,  M.D., and provided dedicated space and personnel ? a manager, research nurse and coordinators, data  specialists, a dedicated senior regulatory associate, an administrative assistant and a protocol administrator to  facilitate expansion of our phase 1 activities including investigator-initiated trials. This focus has led to an  overall increase in accrual to all investigator-initiated early phase trials from 47 in 2009 to 231 in 2013, with an  increase in accrual to investigator-initiated early phase studies supported by these personnel from 8 patients in  2010 to 65 in 2013."
"9483497","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT ADMINISTRATIVE CORE The AC will provide leadership for the Center?s overall strategic planning, including scientific inspiration, vision, and oversight using a community-based multi-level intervention approach and the core principles of transdisciplinary research. We will: (1) engage and incorporate community stakeholders, (2) train under- represented minority post-doctoral scholars and early career investigators, and (3) test innovative multi-level theories and methods through pilot research awards and translation and dissemination of research findings for practice, systems and policy change. These activities of the AC will contribute to a culture shift at the University of New Mexico by providing mechanisms for scholars to move beyond disciplinary and institutional silos by helping scholars to build transdisciplinary collaborations with a focus on innovation and concrete solutions. The AC will manage, coordinate and supervise the entire range of proposed Center activities, monitor progress and ensure that component plans are carried out. The AC will be responsible for facilitating synergy and linkages across the Cores and research and pilot projects. The AC will coordinate interface between the CSAC and the TREE Center, and will liaise with community stakeholders. The AC will ensure that the overarching Social Determinants of Health Framework and thematic foci drive all of our research, training, and dissemination activities. The AC will operate according to the following specific aims: 1) Develop center procedures ensuring the implementation of aims for all Cores and projects, operationalizing responsibilities of the AC, and maintaining compliance with policies and procedures; 2) Launch and support the Community Scientific Advisory Committee (CSAC) to ensure scientific and cultural integrity for all Center activities and coordinate bi- directional communications fostering dissemination of cultural knowledge and research evidence to advance practice, systems and policy change. 3) Provide administrative support, vision, and oversight of the research and pilot projects in alignment with the Center?s mission to assure full compliance and culturally appropriate safeguards for ongoing data safety and data monitoring. 4) Coordinate career enhancement activities to promote the recruitment, development and retention of diverse investigators to address complex behavioral health issues at multiple levels of influence from social inequities and health systems reform to community and policy change. 5) Evaluate the Center outcomes with annual member surveys, retreats, and documentation of key priorities, and develop a standard set of common data elements and measures at multiple domains of influence to assess our collective impact on behavioral health outcomes and reduction of disparities. The aims of the AC will lead to not only culturally appropriate, effective, and sustainable interventions to improve the mental health of participants in the research projects and pilots, but to improved outcomes for populations outside of New Mexico. Further, our transdisciplinary co-leadership model built on mutual values and for diverse leaders has national implications for the future of health equity research. 1"
"9444175","Abstract Since the late 1960?s, a large literature has attempted to characterize the properties of neural responses in motor areas of the brain, and to relate those responses to externally measured variables such as muscle activity or reach direction. In some ways this field has been very successful: early studies revealed robust movement-related modulation of neural firing rates, across a broad network of reciprocally connected areas. Such activity is broadly tuned, in the sense that most neurons respond during most movements, and it was thus appreciated that the relevant computations must be understood at the population level, rather than via the properties of a small subset of responsive neurons. Yet the nature of that population-level computation has remained controversial. This is true even of primary motor cortex, which has made it harder still to characterize and contrast the different computations made by different cortical areas. In general, there remains vigorous disagreement regarding the relationship of cortical activity to the ultimate of the motor system: complex, intricate, temporally rich patterns of activity across a large population of muscles. A fundamental conundrum has been that neural responses in motor cortex (and elsewhere) resemble the responses of muscles in some ways but not others. We will attempt to resolve this apparent paradox through two means. First, we will use emerging methods in rodent that allow recordings from subpopulations of motor cortex neurons, identified via the populations of spinal interneurons to which they project. This will allow us to ask whether the logic of motor cortex responses becomes clearer when subpopulations, with potentially very different roles, are segregated rather than lumped together. Second, we will use analysis methods motivated by network-theory to characterize computationally relevant aspects of the population response. Such methods, many of which exploit machine-learning techniques, hold the promise of explaining otherwise confusing aspects of the population response. Such methods can seek structure predicted by models, determine if it is present, and if so whether it is differentially present across different populations (i.e., subpopulations within motor cortex and populations in other cortical areas). We will also use network modeling both to produce hypotheses, and to explore the computational relevance of novel structure uncovered by our methods. Preliminary data indicate that different populations can appear very similar when analyzed via traditional means, yet show very different population-level structure when approached via our novel methods. Our believe is that a combination of network modeling, analyses inspired by computational-level theories, and a variety of novel classes of data, will allow progress in defining what motor cortex shares with the downstream muscles, what additional computationally relevant properties motor cortex has that the muscles do not, how various computationally relevant properties are / aren?t shared among motor cortex subpopulations, and how the population response in different cortical areas varies in computationally relevant dimensions."
"9419147","Full Research Project 1: Survivorship Care Physical Activity Initiative to Reduce Disparities in HRQOL for Prostate Cancer Survivors (RELate Study) SUMMARY The late effects of prostate cancer (PCa) treatment can lead to unique physical and psychosocial issues that impact their long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Increased physical activity (PA) is a modifiable risk factor which may be targeted to address PCa survivorship-related treatment outcomes and lifestyle behaviors. Increased PA may have greatest impact on outcomes for African-ancestry (AA) PCa survivors, who tend to have lower HRQOL and overall survival, and in whom factors such as a lack of exercise, poor diet, and rates of obesity are most prevalent. While it is well-known that exercise can improve prognosis among cancer survivors, little is known about the bio-behavioral mechanisms and pathways through which PA may improve HRQOL and increase overall survival. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are reactive metabolites produced during normal metabolism as well as the oxidation of biological macromolecules. Lifestyle factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and obesity increase AGE levels in the body. The investigators hypothesize that in a randomized trial of a human PA/dietary intervention with PCa survivors previously diagnosed with Stage I-III PCa (n=120), lower AGE levels will correlate with improved HRQOL, and will lead to differential changes in immune response between AA and European American (EA) trial participants. The investigators further hypothesize that in a mouse model intervention, the mechanistic implications of lifestyle- associated AGEs to tumor-associated immune response and tumor growth and/or progression will mimic those found in human models. Aim 1 is to complete a 1-year, 2-arm (intervention vs usual care) randomized PA/dietary intervention in men diagnosed with stage I-III PCa (co-led by Dr. M. Ahmed, SCSU and Dr. D. Turner, MUSC-HCC). Aim 2 is to evaluate the effect of lifestyle intervention on PA and diet, and define their relationship with AGEs, AGEs pre-cursors, and HRQOL in men diagnosed with stage I-III PCa (led by Dr. Ahmed, SCSU). Aim 3 is to use a spontaneous PCa lifestyle mouse model to define the role of AGE-RAGE signaling to immune-cell phenotypes and tumor progression (led by Dr. Turner, MUSC-HCC). The results could lead to innovative insights for pharmacologic and lifestyle adjustment, and could identify protective factors that may underlie observed differences in PCa treatment outcomes between AA and EA men. This project is synergistically related to the other research projects included in this application"
"9264409","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Papilledema - a specific type of optic nerve edema associated with elevated intracranial pressure - occurs in veterans due to intracranial masses or hemorrhage, obstructive hydrocephalus, following traumatic brain injury, and from idiopathic causes. Currently, the diagnosis of papilledema and its severity are assessed by direct funduscopic observation or digital fundus photographs using a six-stage grading scale. The scale is qualitative, categorical, subject to inter-rater variability, requires clinical expertise, and does not distinguish papilledea from other causes of optic nerve edema. Recent developments in the automated image-analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images have led to the availability of continuous quantitative measures (such as the total retinal volume) of edema severity. However, optical coherence tomography is still too expensive to become readily available outside specialized ophthalmology clinics. Use of low-cost portable color fundus cameras is a more economically viable imaging option in telemedical and emergency settings, but there currently exists no objective method of analyzing and classifying the cause and severity of optic nerve edema. The overall objective of this project is to develop automated color-fundus-photograph-based image-analysis strategies to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve edema and to ascertain features that differentiate its cause. The central hypothesis is that, through the use of  optical-coherence-tomgraphy-based severity measures as a reference standard for computer-based learning of color-fundus-photograph features, the ability to automatically estimate the severity of optic nerve edema in telemedical settings (where only color fundus photographs are likely to be available) will be improved. The rationale for the proposed research is that having automated methods for determination of the severity and cause of optic nerve edema from fundus photographs will enable earlier diagnosis of vision- and life-threatening conditions in telemedical and emergency settings in veterans. The following specific aims will be pursued:  1. Develop and evaluate the automated methodology for computing swollen-optic-nerve-head-  relevant features from color fundus photographs. This will be completed by refining and augmenting  automated fundus-image-analysis approaches for computation of global/regional vascular, textural, and  optic-disc boundary features in patients with optic nerve edema. The relevance of these features will first  be evaluated in this aim via their associations with expert  defined severity rankings.  2. Identify features from color fundus photographs that optimally correlate with OCT-based  measurements of severity in patients with optic nerve edema and develop a fundus-photograph-  based continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to  relate global/regional fundus-based features to recently developed novel automated OCT-based  measures of severity (e.g., the total retinal volume). It is expected that fundus-based severity measures  using the developed automated approach will better correlate (than expert-defined Frisn scale grades -  the current clinical fundus-based ordinal severity scale) with OCT-based measures of severity.  3. Identify features from color fundus photographs that differentiate papilledema from other causes  of optic disc swelling and develop a predictive classifier. The working hypothesis is that regional  differences around the optic disc will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the use of automated image-analysis algorithms for assessing the extent and cause of optic nerve edema in low-cost images reflects a significant department from the status quo of relying on qualitative information. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish much- needed quantitative and objective methods by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling of veterans in telemedical and emergency settings."
"9278872","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal addresses a critical gap in the research regarding a major public health issue ? use of electronic cigarettes (ECs) by smokers. Smokers cite reducing perceived harm from smoking as a leading reason for using ECs, and ECs have been suggested by tobacco researchers as a potential harm reduction vehicle for smokers who cannot or will not achieve smoking cessation. However, current knowledge of the toxicology of ECs is primarily limited to lab tests, with very little corresponding evidence in behavioral studies. As the first human behavioral EC study in which toxicant exposure via the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, NNAL, a highly potent pulmonary carcinogen will be measured, this project will address a critical barrier in the field and advance science on the widely used practice of EC use for harm reduction. Furthermore, this will be the first study to determine how uptake of ECs affects cognitive-perceptual factors involved in sustained tobacco use, such as risk perceptions, utility of smoking, self-efficacy to quit, and tobacco dependence. This study is directly relevant to the NIH?s mission to address cancer risk factors and supports the long-term objective to reduce the disease burden of tobacco use. In the current proposal, cigarette smokers who are not planning to quit smoking, express interest in harm reduction, and who have never been regular EC users (< 25 times in life) will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to an EC group (n=120) or an assessment-only control group (n=60). Those randomized to EC will receive a 12 week supply of a second generation EC starter kit with their choice of liquid flavor from a standard list. Those randomized to assessment only (n=60) will not be provided with EC. Tobacco consumption in both groups will be assessed at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, 8, and 12. Changes in toxic exposure (NNAL, a primary lung carcinogen and the primary outcome) and carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured from baseline to week 12. Aim 1 will characterize the toxic exposure of cigarette smokers randomized to the EC group compared to cigarette smokers randomized to assessment-only controls; Aim 2 will assess the effects of uptake of e-cigarettes on perceptions of harm and utility of products; Aim 3 will illuminate patterns of tobacco product consumption (cotinine-verified) among smokers switching to electronic cigarettes and identify baseline predictors of those patterns, including demographic, smoking history, and psychosocial characteristics. This project will advance science on the widely used practice of EC use for harm reduction by being the first known study in which toxicant exposure via NNAL and change in cognitive-perceptual variables among smokers switching to EC will be characterized and compared to smokers who continue to use cigarettes alone. Study findings will have major public health implications, particularly for smokers who have experienced difficulty in quitting cigarettes and for whom EC use as a harm reduction strategy has been considered. The study will enhance the research environment at the PI?s university which is classified as both a Hispanic Serving Institution and an Asian American-Native American-Pacific Islander Serving Institution."

"9220872","Project Summary/Abstract  With improvements in systemic cancer treatment, the incidence of brain metastases (BM) is increasing but prognosis remains poor as 50% of patients die from their BM. Consequently, there is a critical need to better understand the biology of BM in humans in order to improve treatment for this challenging patient population. While radiation has been the traditional mainstay of treatment for BM, there have been an increasing number of clinical trials using chemotherapy and immunotherapy for BM to try to avoid the negative cognitive impact of radiation to the brain.  In this proposal, we aim to study the response of patients with BM enrolled in a clinical trial of pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. We will incorporate advanced MRI scans into the trial to better understand the biological response of BM to immunotherapy. One particular challenge with immunotherapy is interpreting radiographic responses so Aim 1 will use vascular MR imaging to determine if immune activation results in a different impact on tumor vascular structure and function than true tumor growth. Aim 2 will evaluate tumor heterogeneity since recent data suggests that the degree of tumor heterogeneity may influence response to immunotherapy. Aim 3 will correlate the MRI parameters with tumor tissue. The structure of the trial will allow us to look at baseline MRI parameters as well as longitudinal changes during therapy to shed light on the complex evolution of tumor biology. By looking directly at human BM tumor heterogeneity and response to immunotherapy, the proposed studies will provide greater biological insight into the behavior of these difficult- to-treat tumors and identify noninvasive, clinically applicable MRI parameters that can improve the interpretation of immunotherapy response and ultimately patient management."
"9450147","Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and HIV/AIDS disease are complex disorders that affect the health of disadvantaged racial/ethnic minority groups, largely due to significant health disparities. To make significant progress in identifying the underlying causes of these diseases, and improve their identification, prevention, and treatment, requires the work of a transdisciplinary team of researchers united by a common mission, supported by a connected infrastructure, and working in a geographical location ideally suited for the study of the targeted diseases and disparities. The Research Center in Minority Institutions (RCMI) at Miami-Dade?s Florida International University (FIU) will focus on developing and sustaining a national clinical and behavioral research program addressing health inequities and disparities associated with substance use problems and HIV for underrepresented minorities. Miami-Dade has a high prevalence of substance use problems and one of the highest HIV incidences in the country, with underrepresented minorities at substantially elevated risk for substance use problems and HIV infection?significant health disparities that our RCMI intends to combat. FIU is a minority serving institution (MSI), and in Fall 2016 had nearly 50,000 students (79% from underrepresented minorities). FIU ranks first nationally in bachelor?s, master?s, and doctoral degrees to Hispanics, and second in degrees to all minorities. The FIU-RCMI health disparity research agenda aligns closely with the FIUBeyondPossible2020 Strategic Plan, which includes an emphasis on expansion, student success, and community engagement in health research and education. Research on health disparities, and on substance use problems and HIV, are now central emphases for FIU. In 2016, health inequities and disparities was one of only four academic areas to receive the designation of FIU Emerging Preeminent Program, indicating the university?s current commitment to cluster hiring and infrastructure support for health disparities research. The FIU-RCMI will include five cores?Administrative, Research Infrastructure, Investigator Development, Community Engagement, and Recruitment?each designed to advance and support the FIU-RCMI?s mission, goals, and aims. Outcomes we anticipate from FIU-RCMI-related health disparities capacity expansion, training and mentorship, and research activities include: substantially increased publications citing NIH support; substantially increased proposal submissions to NIH and other granting organizations; substantially increased grants on health disparities awarded to a greater number of investigators, particularly those from underrepresented minority groups; substantially increased professional development activities; substantially increased national prominence in health disparities research; and, in the longer term, substantially decreased health disparities in substance abuse and HIV among Miami-Dade minority communities."

"9322035","Project Summary This study, Developing and evaluating a culturally grounded ?Mother-Daughter? intervention to promote protective factors and reduce early substance use and associated sexual risk among Apache girls, addresses a dangerous upturn in early substance use initiation among American Indian (AI) females through a gender-specific, culturally driven approach. National and tribal data show: 1) girls? substance use is catching up or exceeding boys?; 2) girls use substances for different reasons than boys; 3) health effects are more deleterious for girls; and 4) protective factor approaches appear more effective than risk reduction strategies in AI communities. The primary goal of this research is to test the feasibility of a novel, culturally grounded mother-daughter intervention that taps matrilineal cultural assets to enhance protective and reduce risks factors for early substance use and associated unsafe sexual behaviors among Apache girls as they transition through puberty. Targeted mediators of intervention change are based on a strong line of WMAT-JHU team research, and include: positive maternal (mother and other female caregiver) monitoring and involvement, mother-daughter communication and daughter?s positive cultural identity, emotional regulation, and positive peer group selection. This study?s three primary aims are: 1) To qualitatively gather community attitudes, beliefs and practices about protective and risk factors for early substance use and sexual risk behaviors among Apache females. Through 30 in-depth interviews and 10 focus groups, or until saturation is reached, we will obtain insights on: beliefs and practices related to girls? development of positive cultural and community identity; cultural, familial and community strengths that promote girls? positive transition through puberty; characteristics of protective relationships between girls and their mothers and other adult female caregivers; and other determinants of girls? substance use and sexual risk-taking behaviors. 2) To design a culturally grounded ?mother-daughter? intervention for pre-pubescent girls ages 8 to 11 and their mothers/ female caregivers. The intervention will be delivered by trained Apache behavioral health interventionists. 3) To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention with n=40 mother- daughter dyads and associated female caregivers (i.e., grandmothers, aunties). This proposal is highly significant given the threatening combination of early substance use and sexual risk behaviors among young AI girls on intergenerational cycles of unintended pregnancy and poor behavioral health outcomes. The study will apply strong evidence that parent-child strategies can prevent adolescent substance use to the development of a novel mother-daughter intervention. If study aims are achieved, we will produce a gender- specific intergenerational intervention built on Apache cultural and matrilineal protective factors to reduce early substance use and related sexual risk behaviors among Apache girls, with import to other indigenous communities."

"9439306","ABSTRACT Transwomen Connected: a mobile app delivered HIV prevention program During the past two decades, the HIV epidemic has severely impacted transgender women in the U.S. Analysis of 2013 national HIV testing data found that transgender persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group, and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. Other public health conditions among transgender women include discrimination-based physical and verbal abuse, poor mental health, alcohol and drug use, and unmet health care needs resulting from limited healthcare access and negative healthcare encounters. These co- occurring problems additively increase sexual risk for transgender women. Despite these health disparities and health-care access barriers, the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that HIV prevention efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. In particular, there are no transgender-specific, evidence- based programs that address the unique prevention needs of transgender women, leaving practitioners to implement programs designed for men who have sex with men (MSM) or cisgender women, even though transgender women's experiences of gender abuse, gender transition, transactional sex and violence distinguish them from most MSM and cisgender women. This project will address these gaps and fill an important product niche by testing the feasibility of creating Transwomen Connected: A Sexual Health Promotion Mobile App designed to engage transgender women through a strengths-based approach to HIV prevention and sexual health that uses the power of social networks to identify and encourage protective factors that support the health and well-being of transgender women. The mobile delivered intervention will expand the HIV prevention opportunities for transgender women by (1) providing organizations a cost-effective and easily implementable intervention option that is specifically designed for transgender women; (2) not requiring participants to attend multiple face-to-face sessions in a physical location and instead support iterative intervention implementation at any time or place; (3) permit transgender women to anonymously view the program on their phone in private settings; and (4) offer practitioners and agencies with low levels of technological infrastructure an effective means to connect with clients via mobile technology. The Phase I project, guided by an expert panel of transgender women of color, will produce: extensive formative research; a complete curriculum outline developed using a holistic, sexual harm reduction and life skills framework based on Social Cognitive Theory, gender affirmation, social support, and resilience; a prototype mobile app with complete app design, architecture, and three activities; and a usability evaluation to determine usability, appeal, and impact on knowledge and attitudes. Phase II will complete development and conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness."
"9449329","PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal addresses a major challenge that radiologists and other physicians encounter frequently, namely distinguishing active infection from other processes in the human body. Existing clinical techniques target the host immune response, for example 111In SPECT white blood cell scanning or 18F-FDG PET. Although these modalities can sometimes be useful, they lack the specificity required to distinguish living bacteria from sterile inflammation, cancer, and other highly metabolic tissues. Therefore we are proposing a PET imaging technique that exploits metabolic pathways specific to bacteria, targeting both gram-positive and gram- negative organisms. We believe a technique that detects ALL or at least a majority of pathogenic bacteria will be most useful in clinical practice. Once an imaging abnormality has been identified as infection, tissue sampling, staining and culture may still be required. An imaging method that could distinguish active infection from frequent mimics, would instantly become the standard of care in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings. In this proposal, we develop 18F and 11C tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) using D-Met derived tracers, and study them for the first time in human patients with spinal infections. We have identified 11C D-met as a radiotracer with (1) a simple, high-yield radiosynthesis (2) good in vivo stability (3) appropriate mimicry of the endogenous substrate (4) high rate of incorporation into bacterial peptidoglycan and (5) low uptake in background tissues. We will start by refining the synthesis of enantiopure 11C D-met, and investigating close structural relatives of 11C D-met for enhanced bacterial uptake (Specific Aim 1). We will then study our lead D-met tracer in compelling preclinical infection models, including models of vertebral osteomyelitis-discitis (Specific Aim 2). In Specific Aim 3, we will take all steps needed for an investigational new drug (IND) approval for our lead tracer, and study its performance in patients suffering from spinal infection."

PROJECT SUMMARY: The LBRC has been one of the leaders in interferometric imaging, including wide-field quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) and tomographic phase microscopy (TPM), with applications in label-free quantification of cellular morphology, biomechanics, and cell mass/cycle control. During the next cycle, the LBRC will push this technology forward in three fronts. First, the LBRC has successfully developed novel reflection mode QPMs based on temporal and spatial coherence. While these systems show promise to elucidate the biomechanical changes in red blood cells (RBCs), they do not have the necessary depth resolution and sensitivity to study eukaryotic cells. Given that nuclear rheology is important in diseases such as progeria and in cancer metastasis (CP3,5), we push to develop a next generation reflection-mode QPM to quantify biomechanical factors in diseases of nucleated cells (TRD2.1). Second, we have developed several generations of TPMs that provide exquisite 3D maps of the cellular refractive index (RI) distribution, but they offer low throughput and suffer from the ?missing cone? problem. Given the need to study shape variations during RBC sickling (CP2) and cancer cell migration (CP5,8), we push to explore novel tomographic reconstruction based on reflection mode QPM (TRD2.2). Third, while our interferometric imaging work has been mostly label-free, its usage is partly limited by its lack of molecular specificity. As a completely new direction, driven by the need to study (a) sickle cell disease requiring absorption contrast (CRP2), (b) melanomagenesis mechanisms requiring absorption and Raman contrast (CRP6), and (c) binding of cancer antigens to immune cells (CRP7), we push to explore the possibility of wide-field interferometric imaging with molecular specific contrast mechanisms (TRD2.3)."
"9440206","PROJECT SUMMARY There is much concern by many within public health and medicine, and among policy makers, regarding the increasing use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) by youth given the known risks of nicotine on neurodevelopment and growing evidence of other potential health risks of ENDS use. Since the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) announced its final Deeming Rule, ENDS have been deemed a tobacco product and are now subject to several new regulations, among which include a new warning statement requirement for ENDS products and advertisements that will take effect in August 2018. However, the limited empirical evidence of the impact of the ENDS warning statement on perceptions and use of ENDS presents a critical barrier for the FDA in conducting an accurate Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for its ENDS health warning statement requirement. Therefore, the goal of this project is to address this critical barrier by evaluating the effects of the required FDA Deeming warning statement on the likelihood to purchase ENDS among youth and young adults, and whether this effect depends on ENDS flavor. The objective is to conduct a behavioral economic experiment with U.S. youth and young adults to address three aims to examine: (1) the effects of the presence of ENDS warning statement on the willingness to purchase ENDS and intentions to use ENDS among youth and young adults; (2) if the effect of warning statement on willingness to purchase is mediated by risk perceptions of ENDS; and (3) whether product flavors and individual difference factors (e.g., demographics; tobacco use) modify the effect of ENDS warning statement on risk perceptions, intentions to use, and willingness to purchase. These aims will be accomplished by an online experiment in which 900 youth and young adults sampled to be representative of the US population of 16-25 years old are randomized into conditions varying according to the warning statement (no warning statement, FDA warning statement, and MarkTen warning statement) and ENDS flavor (tobacco, menthol, and fruit flavor), and are asked to complete a hypothetical purchase task. This proposed research addresses FDA Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) research priorities of understanding the impact of economics and policies on tobacco use and perceptions (how is youth tobacco use changing in response to FDA regulatory actions)."
"9431025","Project summary/abstract This proposal describes a 5-year career development program designed to support an academic, physician- scientist career. The proposed research project will capitalize on the expertise and resources available at Washington University in St. Louis, which has a long tradition of developing physician-scientists. Dr. Timothy Ley, an expert in myeloid development and cancer genomics and a recipient of the American Society of Hematology Mentor Award, will serve as the research mentor. The ultimate goal of the candidate is to be an independent investigator in an academic medical center, studying normal and malignant hematopoiesis and taking care of patients with hematologic diseases. The experiments outlined in this application aim to clarify the role of wild type and mutant WT1 in Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression, with the goal to create new therapeutic approaches for this disease. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is a zinc-finger family transcription factor that is highly expressed in AML cells compared to normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, consistent with a possible role in promoting AML development and leading to considerable clinical interest in WT1 as a therapeutic target. Paradoxically, loss-of-function mutations in WT1 are also found in a subset of AML cases, raising the possibility that WT1 may promote or inhibit development of leukemia depending on the molecular context. Our lab recently performed preliminary studies suggesting that when co-occurring with the PML-RARA fusion, WT1 inhibits leukemic progression and self-renewal in a mouse model, suggesting that in this setting WT1 may prevent or delay leukemic progression. To reconcile the seemingly contradictory role of WT1 in AML progression we developed the following hypothesis to be tested in this proposal: WT1 expression is triggered in hematopoietic progenitors as a defensive response to AML-associated driver mutations. While fully transformed AML has developed means to overcome this inhibition, subsequent loss-of function mutations in WT1 provide a growth advantage to mutant subclones. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently found that WT1 mRNA is induced 10-fold in CD34+ cells that have been transduced with several canonical AML-associated fusion genes. In this proposal, we will extend these observations to test whether overexpression or loss-of-function of WT1 can cooperate with these AML-associated mutations in mouse and human systems."

"9514463","Contact PD/PI: Taylor, W. Robert Inst-Career-Dev-001 (696) Project Summary / Abstract ? KL2 Institutional Career Development Core Recent reports by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and others have emphasized the need for a new generation of investigators that are trained in ?interdisciplinary, transformative translational research? and in the leadership and team skills to engage in effective collaborative partnerships. The KL2 Core is an essential component of the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (GaCTSA) and will respond to these critical needs to train a new and diverse generation of clinical and translational research (CTR) investigators who will carry out high impact research and translate new discoveries to improve health. The KL2 core is focused on enhancing the career development of a diverse and talented group of junior faculty (Instructor or Assistant Professor level) with either PharmD, PhD and/or MD degrees at the GaCTSA partner institutions (Emory University, Morehouse School of Medicine [MSM], Georgia Institute of Technology [Georgia Tech], and the University of Georgia [UGA]) with substantial potential to become successful and transformative biomedical researchers. The GaCTSA KL2 core will provide personalized training pathways for KL2 scholars, and didactic and mentored research training to enhance career development. We will build on previous successes of our CTSA and the solid foundation built over the past decade: 73% of our former scholars have gone on to obtain federal funding as PI; 74% of our KL2 scholars have been women; 21% have been from an underrepresented minority (URM) group; 96% remain engaged in careers that encompass CTR; and 5 former KL2 scholars have assumed leadership positions in the GaCTSA. Expansion of the number of KL2 scholars, the integration of UGA into GaCTSA research education programs, and further innovation of our successful KL2 program is proposed. We describe new programs on mentor training, team science training, leadership training, entrepreneurship training, new training in ?big data? analytics, and establishing personalized training pathways to meet the goals and needs of junior faculty at the collaborating institutions. A comprehensive evaluation plan will measure the impact of these activities. We will rely on evidence-based data to make midcourse corrections, as needed. The specific aims of the KL2 Core include: 1) to promote and enhance personalized career development of a diverse cadre of junior faculty at the four GaCTSA institutions who will become successful CTR investigators and leaders of multidisciplinary research teams; 2) to continue to support and innovate the successful GaCTSA Master of Science in Clinical Research (MSCR) program and Certificate Program in Translational Research (CPTR) which provide didactic and mentored CTR training to KL2 scholars and other trainees; and 3) to enhance mentorship training and enrich influential mentoring activities for the next generation of CTR investigators in collaboration with the MSM NIH funded National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) Research Resources and Outreach Core (RROC).

"9404489","Project Summary Our overarching goal is to arrest the HIV epidemic and its negative impact on young people in sub Saharan African (SSA) through improving the uptake, retention and adherence of multi-level combination HIV prevention by AGYW and male partners. South Africa has an estimated 6.3 million people living with HIV ? the highest in the world. Despite having the largest HIV treatment program in the world, HIV incidence in Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW aged 15-24) remains extremely high. Whilst there have been significant innovations in combination HIV prevention, e.g. universal test and treat (UTT) and Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), this has far outpaced the ability to deliver them. To control the HIV epidemic here is an urgent to significantly improve uptake and retention of HIV prevention by AGYW and male partners, alongside UTT of those testing positive. In this project we have a unique opportunity to leverage a key time-sensitive events in a poor and rural hyperendemic area of KwaZulu-Natal: The roll out of eight new youth-focused multi- level HIV prevention interventions for AGYW and their male partners by PEPFAR?s Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS free, Mentored, and Safe (DREAMS) program in the context of a state of the art demographic and health surveillance, where data on individual HIV biomarkers, sexual behaviors, HIV prevention and ART exposure are linked to public-sector clinical records for HIV and other care. We will achieve this through three interlinked aims: Specific aim 1: Quantify how multiple levels of social dynamics interact to predict uptake of DREAMS components. Approach: We will use hierarchical analysis of population surveillance data to evaluate how community, household and interpersonal-level exposures predict uptake of each intervention, and two composite outcome measures: 1) Exposure to community-level DREAMS interventions, 2) uptake of the individual-level HIV care and prevention. Specific aim 2: Elucidate how individuals? life-course transitions and exposure to DREAMS affect retention and adherence to HIV care and prevention. Approach: We will use both survival analysis of the population surveillance data and in-depth qualitative interviews to evaluate how specific life-course events affect HIV prevention and care cascade trajectories and how community-level DREAMS exposures moderate the impact of life-course transitions on adherence and retention. Specific aim 3: Ascertain whether family- and peer-network strategies improve uptake and adherence to combination prevention interventions by young people. Approach: we will work with youth to adapt existing models of community and peer-support to develop an intervention informed by aims 1 and 2. We will pilot the acceptability and feasibility of this approach on improving AGYW and male peers uptake and retention of HIV care and prevention. Our multidisciplinary team includes HIV epidemiologists, a biostatistician, social scientists, psychologist and intervention development expertise from the Africa Health Research Institute, University College London, Southampton and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Moving forward, this will provide answers to an NIH priority area: Can using peer, family and community-level networks harness the full mortality and HIV incidence reducing potential of multi-level HIV prevention for adolescents and young people in rural SSA?"
"9392668","It is well known that causal analysis frequently suffers when relevant variables are left unobserved. Because of this, many modern public health datasets have started including massive quantities of previously unavailable information on each individual. For example, a recent study of flu-like-illness spread on college campuses has collected numerous different static and dynamic networks, biometric information, as well as standard demographic data for each individual. This project develops new statistical and computational tools that incorporate these new data structures into the evaluation of different interventions and produce interpretable causal analyses. Typical approaches to such causal analyses rely on strong modeling assumptions and dimension-reduction techniques that throw away relevant information about individuals and can lead to biased causal estimates. For example, when network information is collected it is frequently reduced to egocentric summaries that do not reflect the overall network structure. The goals of this project are as follows: 1. Develop fast almost-matching-exactly algorithms that construct matched sets for causal inference in massive datasets. 2. Develop methods for matching on available network information in order to better understand how biological processes spread. These tools are widely applicable and may lead to new insights into complex causal mechanisms. In particular this study will evaluate the efficacy of isolation interventions on flu-like-illness spread and propose new and efficient interventions to battle pandemic spread."

"9468901","Project Abstract: Hip and knee replacement surgeries for elderly Medicare beneficiaries have important clinical implications given their effectiveness for advanced osteoarthritis; and important financial implications given their high volume, expenditure, and expected growth in demand. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the care of these surgeries are well-documented. Our preliminary analysis and other studies have demonstrated that blacks undergo these surgeries less frequently and have poorer outcomes as compared to whites, and that patients from lower socioeconomic strata face greater barriers than those from the upper socioeconomic strata in their access to these surgeries. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services introduced the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) Model, which is a bundled payment reform that bundles/includes most spending related to these surgeries (beginning with the inpatient stay, continuing to post-acute care, and ending 90 days after discharge from the hospital) under a single surgical episode. Hospitals, clinicians and post-acute care facilities are therefore financially incentivized to improve the coordination of care across settings, to keep their spending low and to meet important quality benchmarks. However, experts have raised concerns that in the absence of metrics aimed at reducing disparities, the design of the CJR is likely to exacerbate disparities in hip and knee replacement care across patients of different racial and socioeconomic categories, and across hospitals that serve varying proportions of minority patients. These concerns have considerable face validity, yet the impact of bundled payments in general, and the CJR in particular, on disparities has not been empirically evaluated. In light of these gaps in empirical literature, the aims of our proposal are to evaluate the impact of the CJR on racial and socioeconomic disparities in utilization (Aim 1), inpatient outcomes (Aim 2), and post-acute care outcomes (Aim 3) of hip and knee replacement care. Furthermore, we will identify key mechanisms that influence CJR's impact on disparities, and investigate if the changes in outcomes and disparities that we expect are mediated by the choice of post-acute care facility to which a patient is discharged (Aim 4). The overarching rationale for these aims is that in pursuit of financial rewards from the CJR, hospitals are likely to avoid sicker patients, many of whom are likely to be racial and socioeconomic minorities; and hospitals, clinicians, and post-acute care facilities will adopt cost-reduction strategies that may target and adversely influence minority patients, thereby exacerbating disparities. We will conduct rigorous longitudinal analyses using national data to address the specific aims and test associated hypotheses. The knowledge gained from our study will inform the design of current and future bundled payment reforms such that these reforms can prevent the exacerbation of and contribute in reducing existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in hip and knee replacement surgeries."
"9416013","Project Summary/Abstract Understanding how neural circuits process sensory information, generate movement and give rise to other complex behaviors requires an inventory of the cell types comprising these circuits and a means of studying their intrinsic properties and functional connectivity. Recent years have witnessed a revolution in our ability to identify and characterize cell types from highly complex organs based on their transcriptomes. Such transcriptomic analysis ? enabled by remarkable advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies ? not only allows a definitive classification of cell types but also genetic information that can be used to access these cells experimentally. In parallel, significant advances have been made over the last decade in interrogating neuronal anatomy and function by driving expression of fluorescent protein reporters and optogenetic and chemogenetic effectors in specific cell types using cell type-specific transcriptional promoters. However, many if not most cell types in the brain cannot be defined by a single gene marker alone but rather require combinations of markers to allow their unambiguous identification. Thus, comprehensive access to cell types in the mammalian brain will require a strategy to create ? at scale ? mouse lines in which cell types are labeled intersectionally based on co-expression of multiple marker genes. In this Research Segment, we will deploy an efficient mouse transgenic pipeline based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing technologies to generate intersectional mouse driver/reporter lines that label cell types discovered by transcriptomics in Research Segment 1 and from other groups around the world. Our mouse genome engineering pipeline is scalable and designed to allow the rapid generation and screening of mouse reporter lines for downstream anatomical and functional analysis."
"9426375","PROJECT SUMMARY A key event in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) is the loss of aggrecan from the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage. In addition to aggrecan, hyaluronan (HA) is also coordinately lost. We have found that experimental removal of HA can mimic OA including enhancing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and the degradation of aggrecan. In gain-of-function experiments, viral overexpression of the enzyme that synthesizes HA, HA synthase-2 (HAS2) reversed these changes primarily by reducing chondrocyte responsiveness to pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1?, TNF-? and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as promoting aggrecan retention. However, although HAS2 overexpression (HAS2-OE) shows potential in vitro, it remains difficult if not impossible to test or apply this approach in vivo. While testing the mechanism of HAS2-OE we made a surprising and counterintuitive observation. The small chemical inhibitor of HA biosynthesis 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a coumarin derivative, partially reduced HA biosynthesis as expected but, did not reverse HAS2- OE effects. Moreover, 4-MU by itself, was highly effective (and additive to HAS2-OE) at reducing chondrocyte responsiveness to pro-inflammatory mediators and was effective even with HAS2 knockdown or knockout. 4-MU treatment blocks aggrecan loss in human OA or bovine cartilage explant cultures?a blockage that we have termed, chondroprotection. This proposal will test in Aim 1 whether mice fed 4-MU are resistant to the development of OA in a model wherein OA is initiated via the surgical destabilization of the medial menisci. Recently, others have shown (in other cell types) that HAS2-OE generates a major stress on intracellular UDP-hexosamine pools resulting in upregulation of HIF-1?, followed by changes in cell metabolism and phenotype. 4-MU inhibits HA synthesis by sequestering large amounts of intracellular UDP-GlcUA. We will test the hypothesis that HAS-OE as well as 4-MU both stress and reduce the intracellular UDP-hexose pools in chondrocytes, resulting in similar metabolic feed-back?responses that include activation of transcriptional factors such as HIF-1? that control oxidative phosphorylation/glycolysis pathways. We hypothesize that, as a part of these changes in UDP- hexose biosynthetic coupled pathways, there is reduced sensitivity of chondrocytes to pro-inflammatory mediators thus also providing chondroprotection. The mechanisms involved and changes in chondrocyte metabolomics will be examined in Aim 2 of this proposal. We will manipulate and enhance these glyco- metabolic states in vivo as well as in vitro. The goal of these studies is to determine what state of glucose utilization or metabolism, induced by flux in the UDP-hexose pools, will contribute to the reduction of OA progression."

"9406023","Project Summary/Abstract  There has been increasing recognition over the last several years of the heterogeneity in the pathobiologic underpinnings of asthma and the critical importance of phenotyping and endotyping in dictating response to therapy. For example, it was only after selecting patients with sputum (and later blood) eosinophilia and using exacerbation rate as the primary outcome, was the utility of mepolizumab in asthma uncovered in a clinical trial setting. With multiple immune-modulating biologic agents already available and with more to come in the very near future, our understanding how to best deploy these agents in a precise manner to patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma (those who would be most likely to be prescribed biologic agents) must be refined. The PrecISE Network will use sequential, adaptive clinical trial designs, which represents a novel approach in asthma clinical research, to answer these questions, while also presenting an opportunity for significant progress in phenotyping and endotyping as applied to clinical management of patients with severe asthma. In this application, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Establishment of the San Diego Team Asthma Management Program (STAMP) as a Clinical Center in the NHLBI PrecISE Network: We have put together a team that leverages the substantial resources of UCSD and the San Diego region to create a PreCISE Clinical Center that will optimally recruit subjects and perform PrecISE Network protocols as they are developed and implemented. 2) Proposal of a PrecISE Netowrk Clinical Trial Using a sequential, adaptive, phase IIb/proof of concept design: In accordance with the goals of the PrecISE Network, our proposed trial design will be center on the use of precision interventions based on stratification of severe asthma subjects by phenotype/endotype. Using already established biomarkers, including blood/sputum eosinophilia, serum periostin, serum IgE, and exhaled NO, we propose to stratify subjects into Th2-high (?Th2H?), non-Th2-high (?NTh2H?), and MIXED endotypes to dictate experimental interventions. Th2H and MIXED subjects would be randomized to placebo, Allakos (Anti-Siglec-8 monoclonal antibody), or dupilumab (anti-IL4/IL13 receptor). Concurrently, NTh2H subjects would be randomized into placebo, etanercept (TNF inhibitor), or dupilumab. During the trial, some of these interventions may be shown to have a lack of sufficient activity and these will be withdrawn after interim analysis and replaced by new agents or by new biomarker-defined groups. Successful treatments at the interim analysis stage will proceed to the next stage. 3) Identification of novel biomarkers to stratify responders to targeted treatments: Our group has the scientific expertise to perform and analyze novel biomarker studies associated with PrecISE protocols. We propose to leverage these micro-scaled genomic and immunology tools to identify novel biomarkers for treatment response from sputum and blood samples of our study subjects."
"9459450","UC4 APPLICATION: DRIVERS AND CONSEQUENCES OF b-CELL DNA  DAMAGE IN DIABETES Abstract: The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus has reached epidemic proportions world-wide, and is predicted to increase rapidly in the years to come, putting a tremendous strain on health care budgets in both developed and developing countries. There are two major forms of diabetes and both are associated with decreased beta-cell mass. Exciting recent data have provided evidence that metabolic stress is associated with DNA double strand breaks in multiple models of impaired glycemia. Based on our exciting preliminary data, we propose to develop novel technologies further to specifically determine the accumulated mutation load, as well as physiological responses to genomic stress in human beta- cells, all at the single cell level. In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mechanisms that cause b- cell DNA damage in diabetes, based on our hypothesis that metabolic and/or inflammatory insults and abortive replication attempts result in formation of double-strand breaks in b-cells, potentially in discrete locations. To this end, we will perform genome-wide CHIP-Seq experiments with antibodies against the DNA damage response proteins 53BP1 and gH2AX, as well as the BLISS method to reveal the location of actual DNA breaks at a single-base resolution in healthy and metabolically- stressed b-cells from mice and humans. In Aim 2, we will analyze the cumulative mutation load of human b-cells in diabetes, based on our hypothesis that metabolic insults and abortive replication attempts result in the accumulation of somatic mutations in b-cells, contributing to their loss of function and possibly to immunogenicity in diabetes. To accomplish this goal, we will determine the cumulative mutation load of stressed b-cells using single cell exome-, RNA-, and ATACseq analysis.  To accomplish these aims, we will use cutting-edge and emerging technologies that are already established in our laboratories. We have assembled an outstanding team of scientist with complementary expertise, ranging from human islet transplantation to computational biology, to assemble an atlas of the human endocrine pancreas in health and disease at the single cell level. These datasets and technologies promise to greatly increase our understanding of the human beta- cell in health and disease."
"9396779","Project Summary/Abstract The PI is committed to the development of novel tools for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, with a short-term objective to gain impactful and necessary training and a long-term commitment towards a career path in breast cancer radiology and oncology. The PI recently joined the community of dedicated cancer researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) as a postdoctoral research scholar in the Lab of Professor Jason S. Lewis, an internationally renowned expert in PET probe development and translational science. The Advising Committee, comprised of a Primary Mentor (Lewis) and Co-Mentors (Drs. Weber and Morris) and PI have identified specific areas in cancer biology, pathophysiology, and radiology which the PI will need to further develop to establish himself as an independent researcher; they have cooperatively formulated a plan for training and development. The proposed F32 training plan outlines a set of career development activities and workshops?including grant writing, public speaking, lab management, and mentoring students? designed to enhance the PI?s ability to be an independent investigator. The PI?s choice of sponsors, research project, and training will provide a solid foundation to reach his present and future academic and professional goals (please see Biosketches and Facilities & Resources). Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women in the United States, with approximately 12% of women developing breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. 10-20% of this patient population is affected by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype with particularly poor prognosis in part due to the lack of effective targeted therapies. The Lewis Lab has developed a pH(low) insertion peptide (pHLIP), which targets tissues with increased extracellular acidity?a hallmark of virtually all cancerous tissue?through cellular membrane insertion. Affinity of pHLIP for this universally exhibited tumoral trait highlights its potential for use in oncologic clinical applications, and in particular for TNBC, as pHLIP targeting is unaffected by the absence of ER, PR, and HER2 characterized by TNBC. Therefore, the objective of this project is multifaceted: a) to optimize pHLIP for use as a general diagnostic tool with generator-produced radiometals in an effort to decouple clinics from the need for a neighboring cyclotron, b) to extend the clinical applications of pHLIP to targeted therapy and theranostics for TNBC, c) to develop a novel 225Ac-based pHLIP radiobioconjugate for targeted ?-therapy of TNBC, and finally, d) to make a lasting contribution to patient care through the development of a motivated, independent investigator committed to the conquest of cancer."
"9381805","ABSTRACT Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic mental illness affecting 4-7 million people in the US. Patients are impaired in multiple Research Domain constructs. Medication and behavioral therapies yield inadequate symptom relief in 50-70% of patients. As a result, OCD remains a leading worldwide cause of disability, equivalent to more visible disorders such as schizophrenia. Roughly 1/3 of patients are unable to work due to their symptoms and their caregivers report profound, life-impairing stress. More recently, the field has focused on deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, about a third of the patients who undergo DBS receive no meaningful benefit. We propose a primarily retrospective investigation of imaging-based targeting for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We aim to increase response rates while testing imaging biomarkers that could guide therapeutic intervention. Our hospital is the highest-volume site in the US using DBS at the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) for the treatment of intractable OCD. A major contributor to imperfect response is that DBS is implanted at standard coordinates across patients, without accounting for variation in VC/VS anatomy. Our investigation will study imaging markers that may target ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) for DBS to patient-specific brain circuitry. We hypothesize that clinical response will be related to the degree that the DBS electrical field influences orbitofronto-thalamic fibers and the nucleus accumbens grey matter. If we are successful in identifying a biomarker during this three-year retrospective study, a future prospective clinical trial will target DBS implants to the newly identified structures in a patient-specific fashion."
"9440020","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease is a growing problem globally, where it now affects more than 10% of the population. In low- and middle-income countries, there is limited data on the actual scope of the problem, however, since it is difficult to obtain reliable estimates of rates of chronic kidney disease for the population, especially in rural or underserved communities. This project will take place in Guatemala, which is a Central American country with a rising rate of chronic kidney disease. Guatemala also has large rural and indigenous Maya populations, and virtually nothing is known about the burden of chronic kidney disease in those populations. This information gap is important for several reasons. One reason is that the indigenous population suffers from very high rates of stunting (short stature), which we hypothesize may be an important risk for developing chronic kidney disease, especially when combined with other traditional risk factors like diabetes or obesity. Another reason is that a surge in kidney disease of uncertain cause (called ?nontraditional? chronic kidney disease) is occurring among young agricultural workers along the Pacific Coast of Guatemala, which appears to be unrelated to diabetes, high blood pressure, or the other usual risk factors that cause kidney disease. In this project, we will take a random sample of adults from two different Guatemalan towns: one with a high proportion of indigenous Maya and a high rate of stunting, one with a low proportion of indigenous Maya but located in the part of Guatemala where the surge in kidney disease of unknown cause is occurring. We will measure the rates of kidney disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes in these samples. We will also ask questions of each individual about potential exposures and causes of kidney disease. Statistical analysis of this data will allow us to determine the rate of chronic kidney disease in each town, estimate ethnic disparities (indigenous vs nonindigenous) in chronic kidney disease, and explore potential causes of both traditional kidney disease (such as diabetes or stunting) and nontraditional kidney disease. This project represents a concerted effort on the part of our respective institutions in Guatemala and the United States to bridge the ?urban-rural divide? in chronic kidney disease, providing for the first time high- quality, systematic data from rural Guatemala on the impact of this important illness."
"9416017","Abstract Understanding the exact cell-type composition in the different regions of the mouse brain is a fundamental step when trying to integrate physiological, behavioral, neurochemical and molecular data. At present, although major categories of cell-types present in the mouse brain have been defined through a handful of specific markers, the different subtypes within these categories, as well as their location and connectivity are far from understood. Epigenomic signatures such as DNA methylation (mC) and open chromatin are stable modifications that persist in post-mitotic cells throughout their lifetime, defining their cellular identity. Open chromatin as well as methylation patterns are cell type specific, differentiating the major types of cells i.e., neurons and glia, in the rodent and human cortex, as well as differentiating neuronal types in mouse brain. Research Segment 1 of this center proposes to produce a catalog of methylation and open chromatin patterns at the single-cell level throughout the entire mouse brain. Analysis of the combined data will permit the discovery of cell-type specific regulatory regions that will allow the production of transgenic mouse lines and viral tools that will become available to the community."
"9405320","Severe asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease with significant health care utilization, poor quality of life and increased mortality. Our understanding of the disease pathobiology has significantly advanced, particularly through the NHLBI Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP). Through multivariate cluster analyses using objective physiologic and biologic parameters, unbiased phenotypic analyses divides the spectrum of asthma into subpopulations with specific disease characteristics that strongly suggest variability in therapeutic responses to corticosteroid and additional controller therapies. This heterogeneity is particularly apparent among asthmatic patients with more severe disease. This approach, based on understanding disease pathobiology, has greater personalized therapeutic implications than an approach which just broadly classifies severe asthma as asthma that is not adequately controlled using corticosteroids and additional controllers. This proposal represents an extension of the understanding gained in SARP, where we will define therapeutic responses across a spectrum of severe asthma to further define phenotypes/endotypes using known biomarkers while developing and testing novel molecular and genomic biomarkers. While the understanding of severe asthma phenotype/endotype pathobiology has advanced, the response to therapies which target specific inflammatory pathways in asthma is not completely understood. Furthermore, we are not able to definitively predict response to treatments based upon a priori clinical characteristics and expression of known biomarkers. To advance precision medicine approaches in severe asthma, it is crucial to understand the phenotypes and endotypes including cellular, protein and genomic biomarkers that predict asthma pharmacologic responsiveness to specific asthma interventions. We hypothesize that adaptive sequential clinical trials are an important fundamental approach to address asthma heterogeneity and to make major advances in the treatment of severe asthma. To test this hypothesis, we will perform clinical and molecular phenotyping in participants with severe and/or exacerbation prone asthma to include responsiveness to corticosteroids to identify specific phenotypes/endotypes for participation in a network wide PrecISE trial. (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will collaborate with all other clinical sites to perform innovative, sequential adaptive clinical trials including novel interventions based on predictive biomarkers. In Aim 3, we will refine current biomarkers and develop new predictive and dynamic biomarkers of response before and after treatment with targeted therapies to increase their predictive abilities and introduce new biomarkers to the clinical arena. This proposal will allow patients with severe asthma access to novel therapies and improve our ability to predict therapeutic responses using clinical and molecular biomarkers in this heterogeneous disease."

"9276257","Project Summary/Abstract  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased at an alarming rate (>500%) in the last few  decades, far exceeding any other cancer type, in the United States. The prognosis for EAC patients remains  poor with very limited treatment options. Although Barrett?s esophagus (BE), a columnar metaplasia of the distal-  esophagus epithelium, is the only known precursor of EAC, the vast majority of BE patients however do not  develop dysplasia or cancer; consequently the factors driving progression from BE to EAC remain elusive. Our  long-term objective is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying EAC progression, such that reliable biomarkers  and targeted therapies can be developed for effective management of this deadly disease. Recently, using  innovative RNA sequencing in BE-associated lesions, we identified two large intergenic non-coding RNAs  (lincRNAs) showing marked and selective inductions in ~50% of EAC lesions. Both lincRNAs exhibited nuclear  localization, and preliminary functional assessments strongly suggested these lincRNAs to play pro-tumorigenic  roles during EAC progression. Our study thus provides the first global analysis of lincRNAs in this disease,  identifying two novel lincRNAs with potential oncogenic roles in esophageal carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the  specific goals of the current proposal are: (AIM 1) To elucidate the function of candidate EAC-associated  lincRNAs. We will generate CRISPR/Cas9-based inducible lincRNA-knockout EAC cell line models to  comprehensively characterize the phenotypic effects of candidate lincRNAs using both in vitro, and in vivo  xenograft experimental systems; (AIM 2) To dissect the molecular regulatory networks upstream and  downstream of EAC-associated lincRNAs. We will evaluate for potential genomic/epigenomic mechanisms  driving lincRNA expression in EACs; using the EAC cell line models, we will perform global gene expression  microarray profiling to delineate the genes/pathways modulated by the lincRNAs; and we will use ChIRP-seq/-  MS approaches to map the genomic occupancy and to identify potential gene targets and protein partners of  candidate lincRNAs, thus establishing a regulatory-roadmap of candidate lincRNAs; (AIM 3) To determine the  timing and stage-associated deregulations in candidate lincRNAs during EAC progression. Our preliminary  findings showed both lincRNAs being induced in high-grade dysplasia (HGD), a histopathologic surrogate for  EAC risk. Accordingly, we will validate and ascertain the frequency of lincRNA deregulations in these overtly  pre-malignant phases of disease progression. Additionally, we will test: whether non-dysplastic BE lesions,  within close proximity to EAC, show induction of these candidate lincRNAs; and whether candidate lincRNAs  show induction early-on in non-dysplastic BE/low-grade dysplasia (LGD) mucosa, derived from high-risk patients  who developed cancer during follow-up. Success in these studies will uncover molecular mechanisms  contributing to EAC progression; enable development of evidence-based molecular biomarkers for early cancer  detection and surveillance; and open new avenues for targeted therapies in this increasingly fatal cancer."
"9559764","Project Summary Abstract: Our capability to apply high-throughput molecular profiling technologies to increasingly large cohorts and sample sets is significantly expanding our understanding of human biology and complex disease. The Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project is creating a unique resource of genetic variation and gene expression across a wide range of human tissues. Upon completion this will include RNA sequence data from over 25,000 samples spanning 53 human tissues/organs and whole genome and exome sequence data from 960 donors. Additional data types not yet generated will include miRNA-seq, protein levels, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, and DNase I hypersensitive site data among others. The ability to easily access, interpret and integrate these large data sets by a wide range of users with varying needs and skills is becoming of critical importance to leverage the full utility of the data. The GTEx Portal (http://gtexportal.org/) is the most widely accessed resource for the GTEx project, hosting all unprotected data, analysis results and numerous visual exploration tools, and has been enthusiastically received by the scientific community. To maximize the impact of this resource, we plan to expand the portal to: host data currently in production and new data types still to be generated; present novel and integrative analyses of existing data, and data from external sources; and to develop and share flexible tools for data analysis, visualization and access. Aim 1. We will host and support all open-access GTEx data and analysis results, performing systematic re-analyses of the data with new methods to reflect the state-of-the-art in RNA-seq analysis. We will add all new data sets to the portal to include novel assays (e.g. mi-RNA-seq, protein, methylation assays, etc/), derived analysis results (e.g. trans-eQTLs, splice- QTLs, GWAS enrichment analyses, protein-QTLs, etc.), and RNA-seq data sets from external investigators. Aim 2. We will work closely with both small focus groups of tool developers and engage our large user-base to identify and prioritize new features for development to display and integrate between multiple data types, and collaborate with other large genomic resources (e.g. ENCODE, UCSC and ENSEMBL browsers) to enable better integration of data sources and to enhance the utility and accessibility of the GTEx resource. Aim 3. We will automate and share all analysis pipeline tools with the scientific community. To support a wide range of user access needs, we will develop an open-source API to provide comprehensive data access, and also improve visualization tools and user-driven data analyses on the portal. To maximize use of the resource, we will design and offer training videos and outreach workshops. "
"9466753","PROJECT SUMMARY  While modern HIV combination therapy has transformed HIV into a manageable chronic infection for many patients, HIV/AIDS remains a formidable global epidemic. Despite the effectiveness of combining drugs from different classes, side effects and drug resistance remain serious concerns for these life-long therapies. Thus, there is an enduring need for novel HIV inhibitors with new mechanisms of action and stronger barriers to resistance. Furthermore, it is recognized that lack of patient compliance is a major factor leading to treatment failure. For this reason, HIV specialists are excited by the prospect of long-acting therapies, and a combination of such therapies would provide a revolutionary new treatment option for many HIV patients.  Navigen is a small pharmaceutical company targeting infectious diseases through an innovative discovery and design process. We have identified a novel HIV entry inhibitor, cholesterol-PIE12-trimer (CPT31), that is a protease-resistant D-peptide (peptide made from D-amino acids) that targets HIV?s conserved entry machinery. With highly potent activity against all major HIV subtypes, designed barriers to resistance, and in vivo animal efficacy, our anti-HIV D-peptide overcomes the current limitations of the entry inhibitor treatment class. Additionally, CPT31 is ideal for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) since it blocks the first stage of the viral lifecycle prior to infection of target cells.  Navigen has advanced CPT31 to late preclinical development via a recently completed Phase II SBIR award. In this three-year SB1 application we will complete 1) GMP manufacturing of drug substance, 2) GMP formulation of drug product including stability testing and aseptic packaging, 3) IND-enabling animal toxicology, and 4) our IND package. These studies will exclusively advance a daily-dosing formulation that will be used to establish the safety of our D-peptide therapeutic in animals and humans. However, CPT31?s high potency, protease resistance, and favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) and physicochemical properties make it an ideal candidate for extended-release depot formulation. In parallel with the studies proposed here, we are working with extended-release formulation experts to develop a long-acting formulation of CPT31 (CPT31-LA) suitable for once-monthly (or less frequent) injection. Many patients prefer long-acting injectables to daily oral pills. Therefore, CPT31-LA will likely achieve broad market penetration.  Achieving IND status will greatly facilitate the early investment needed to demonstrate human efficacy with CPT31 and, ultimately, a licensing agreement with a large pharmaceutical company who can bring CPT31-LA to market as a potentially transformative new option for the prevention and treatment of HIV."
"9407827","Abstract word count: 424 HIV infected adults who drink are already physiologically frail due to HIV infection, comorbidity (including hepatitis C infection), polypharmacy and associated substance use. In this setting, biomedical consequences of alcohol use can occur with moderate use and are often unappreciated or misattributed. The ?Consortium to improve OutcoMes in HIV/Aids, Alcohol, Aging & multi-Substance? (COMpAAAS) is supported by NIH/NIAAA award U24AA020794 to study this issue in a single sample, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) (~50,000 HIV+ US veterans demographically matched to ~100,000 uninfected comparators). VACS will employ a direct alcohol biomarker (Phosphatidyl-ethanol (PEth) and a validated measure of physiologic frailty (VACS Index). In this set of three applications, the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) and Kaiser Permanente (KP) teams join the Veterans Healthcare System (VA) team as COMpAAAS Tripartite: ART-CC, KP, and VA. Our long term goal is to inform alcohol intervention design and implementation. Together we propose to study biomedical consequences of alcohol and associated substance use in HIV extending the scope and generalizability of VACS to multiple healthcare systems in North America and Europe and substantially increasing sample size and diversity of HIV+ subjects. Importantly, COMpAAAS Tripartite also extends uninfected comparators, a critically important group if we are to understand how alcohol may differentially effect biomedical outcomes in HIV. KP will be able to identify appropriate comparators from their Northern California region. A new VA sample of veterans born in 1945-1965 (Birth Cohort) substantially expands access to Hepatitis C infected (HCV+) and women comparators. The tripartite group will also participate in a HIV+ substudy (n=2250), The Medications, Alcohol, Substance Use in HIV Study (MASH), in which new data on potentially inappropriate medications (PIMS) and direct biomarkers for alcohol and associated substances (tobacco, marijuana, opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine) will be prospectively collected. In initial years, analyses will be conducted using self-report of alcohol and substance use. Limited data sets and uniform methods for data cleaning, standardization, and imputation will be employed across teams. Analyses will be repeated in the final year correcting for biases in self-reported alcohol and substance use based upon MASH results. Consistent with the RFA, all grants contribute data for all aims, have identical aims and protocols, and share data. The VA team will coordinate data sharing and analyses. Each collaborator will be responsible for conducting analyses for one aim. In this application, we will investigate the risk of mortality, hospitalization, and increased physiologic frailty measured by the VACS Index that is attributable to different levels of alcohol use and we will compare these outcomes in HIV-infected and uninfected populations."

"9409052","SAMPLE PREPARATION; The Achilles Heel of Mass Spectrometry Based Diagnostics II. Project Summary.  LC-MS provides superior data in clinical diagnostics relative to immunoassays, but it is slow and costly. As the old saying goes, time is money. The technique must become simpler, faster, and less expensive to displace older, less accurate immunological assay (IA) methods. The focus of this proposal is to make LC-MS analytics more competitive in clinical diagnostics by increasing throughput 10 fold with existing instrumentation.  The objective in Phase I was to use analyte sequestering transport particles (ASTPs) to circumvent the above limitations by i) structure specifically sequestering analytes of interest, ii) separating them from non-analytes within a min, ii) rapidly transferring them to an MS, and iv) enabling the MS to identify all analytes of interest in less than 60 sec. This was achieved by preparing 2 megadalton (mDa) ASTPs that sequester analytes at their surface; elevating their effective Mw to 2 mDa and allowing them to be purified by mobile affinity sorbent chromatography (MASC) in 60 sec. Thermal or solvent dissociation was used to recover analytes for ESI-MS or LDTD-MS wells.  This proposal has four specific aims. One is to complete manufacturing protocols for antibody and protein A/G based ASTP products that capture, resolve, and transport analytes to MS or fluorescence instruments in research, big pharma, and CRO laboratories. The second is to integrate the above ASTP products into miniature membrane laboratories (MemLabs); producing point-of-collection products that extract plasma from a drop of blood and prepare samples in situ for biomarker detection. The third aim was to evaluate and optimize the release and detection of analytes from ASTPs via LDTD-MS, MALDI-MS, and ESI-MS. The fourth specific aim is to adapt ASTP technology to multiplexed drug testing and the analysis of protein i) primary structure, ii) post-translational modifications, and iii) conformation."

"9469115","PROJECT SUMMARY TMD is a prevalent, but poorly understood condition that can be difficult to treat. Many patients with chronic TMD have pain that continues after injury resolution or no obvious underlying tissue damage. Their pain is thus most likely due to dysfunction in central pain processing circuitry. Nociception is the transmission of information about harmful stimuli from the peripheral tissues to the central nervous system. Nociceptive signals are actively regulated by descending pain-modulatory systems, which can either dampen of enhance nociceptive transmission. The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is a major output of the best-studied pain-modulation circuit. RVM modulates nociceptive transmission via two classes of cells, termed ?ON-cells? and ?OFF-cells.? A third class of cells in RVM, referred to as ?NEUTRAL cells,? have no apparent function in pain-modulation. The net effect of RVM output on nociceptive processing in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord has been studied extensively, and shown to be altered in states of persistent pain. However, the changes in ON- and OFF cells, the output of the descending control from RVM, during orofacial inflammation have not been determined. The goal of this proposal is to determine how orofacial inflammation changes the outputs of RVM ON- and OFF-cells. Specifically a masseter muscle inflammation model of myogenous TMD in the rat will be used to achieve this goal. Changes in cell firing evoked by innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation of orofacial tissues will be quantified using in vivo electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that the force required to elicit an RVM neuronal response will be decreased in animals with masseter inflammation, at the site of inflammation as well as at distant locations (Specific Aim 1). Additionally, light leads to changes in a subset of RVM cells. If the proportion and responsiveness of light sensitive RVM cells increases in states of persistent pain, then light could facilitate pain transmission through RVM. Thus, this project will test the hypothesis that orofacial inflammation will increase light responsiveness of RVM (Specific Aim 2). This work will contribute significantly to our understanding of the neural circuitry changes underlying chronic TMD."

"9450435","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide death rates for indigenous Hawaiians are amongst the highest in the world for youth, taking a tremendous toll on local communities. Such tragic moments can be filled with darkness, confusion, doubt and uncertainty, contributing to contagion, further suffering and feelings of hopelessness among youth, their families, and the community. Influenced by community support and understanding as well as a sense of belonging and cultural respect, our indigenous Hawaiian youth and families have demonstrated resilience. Programs that build on these strengths through learning about their cultural values and practices show promise. Effective suicide prevention for rural and indigenous youth requires a broad-based community commitment and connection. Comprehension of local, community perspectives of suicide and well-being enhances the knowledge of existing evidence that suicide determinants are valid for rural youth. Our long- range is to integrate community wisdom with scientific methods to conduct youth suicide prevention research that mitigates health disparities and improves the wellbeing of indigenous Hawaiian youth and their communities. Our overall objective is to develop and demonstrate a culturally-responsive youth suicide prevention program that has a positive impact in a Native Hawaiian community. The Building Strengths and Inspiring Hope among Youth and their Communities Project will use a community engaged approach and cultural knowledge and practices to inform the selection, adaptation, development and evaluation of a viable, multi-faceted youth suicide prevention strategy. The specific aims are to: adapt and develop the components for youth suicide prevention intervention, and refine the intervention methodology to align with these adaptations (Aim 1: Culturally-Tailor Intervention); and to conduct a randomized community study to evaluate and compare the effects of gatekeeper training and an integrated program, the Caring Communities for Youth Suicide Prevention in increasing wellness; suicide prevention skills, including recognition of risk and protective factors, and warning signs of a person at-risk for suicide; increasing competence in dealing with suicide events; and decreasing stigma related to discussing suicide and seeking mental health care services (Aim 2: Intervention Research). This 2-year developmental project is a translational, demonstration research study in behavioral and clinical health advancing knowledge in health inequity and disparities among Native Hawaiians for youth suicide by comparing two types of community-based interventions in a regression point displacement design. We will use a randomized community, superiority trial to evaluate the Caring Communities for Youth Suicide Prevention Program (integrated and multifaceted) with gatekeeper training alone. We expect to improve the synergy between evidence interventions and culturally-informed, community- based youth programs, and improve youth and community wellness, advancing the knowledge about and availability of more culturally relevant suicide prevention interventions for indigenous communities."

The specific career goals of this application are to: (1) Develop expertise in integrating tobacco treatment in the thoracic oncology and lung cancer screening (LCS) setting; (2) Develop mastery in clinical trials research; (3) Develop expertise in health services research; and (4) to solidify skills in research dissemination. These goals will be accomplished through coursework, seminars, journal clubs, mentored research, manuscript authorship, grant development, and collaboration with other investigators in the rich research environment at Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Hollings Cancer Center at MUSC recently established a LCS program, for which the candidate's primary mentor serves as the Co-Director. Screening for lung cancer at earlier, more treatable stages has the potential to reduce mortality from the U.S.'s most deadly cancer. Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is now recommended for high risk individuals based on age and smoking history. The clinical ramifications of smoking cessation following a LDCT could be profound. To complement the career objectives, the research plan will evaluate a smoking cessation intervention for LCS patients. The primary aim of the study is to conduct a 2-arm pilot randomized clinical trial with patients referred for LCS who smoke (N = 80) to evaluate 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates and determine effect size estimates among participants who receive a standard intervention (brief counseling session at time of LCS) versus a medication and text messaging intervention (MTI; standard intervention + 8 weeks of NRT + gain-framed text messages with medication use reminders). A secondary aim will be to examine 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates and determine effect size estimates at the 3-month follow-up. Further, as exploratory aims, mediators and moderators of smoking cessation outcomes (i.e., nicotine dependence, medication adherence, positive lung finding from the scan [e.g., nodule is present]) and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated. The proposed research has numerous strengths including: a) a timely research question, namely how to optimally enhance smoking cessation in current smokers who are receiving LCS; b) gain-framed smoking cessation text messaging specifically developed for LCS patients; and c) potential to easily translate the findings to the growing number of LCS programs across the country. Research on tobacco treatment interventions for LCS patients could reduce the future incidence of cancer and mortality for this high-risk patient population. The research plan will serve as a complement to the candidate's career development plan in furthering training in cancer prevention and control."

The physiological mechanisms that determine why some obese individuals are protected, and why some normal weight individuals are at risk, are poorly understood, because clinical studies are often too small and methods to test presumed pathways involved are too invasive. Identifying genes and the pathways in which they are implicated provides an alternative strategy to elucidate the biology that underlies the MHO and MONW.  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have so far identified >300 loci for obesity traits. However, these loci have provided only limited insight into the mechanisms that link obesity and its complications, because the GWAS examine each trait in isolation and ignore the fact that obesity is a heterogeneous clinical condition.  Therefore, we propose to [1] perform a multi-trait genome-wide search for obesity-increasing loci with protective effects on cardiometabolic traits and vice versa, [2] prioritize candidate genes within identified loci, and [3] functionally characterize prioritized candidate genes in model systems.  Specifically, we apply two complementary discovery approaches. In the first approach (Aim 1a), we perform multi-trait correlated meta-analyses that combine summary statistics of adiposity and cardiometabolic GWAS from large-scale genetic consortia and the UK Biobank (Ntotal~840,000). We aim to identify SNPs simultaneously associated with increased adiposity and a favorable cardiometabolic risk profile, and vice versa. In the second approach (Aim 1b), we use individual-level data from the UKBiobank (N~500,000) to perform GWAS on new outcomes derived from the difference between a cardiometabolic and an adiposity trait. Next, we prioritize the most likely candidate genes in identified loci and the most relevant tissues using functional annotation pipelines (Aim 2a) and high-throughput screens in transgenic CRISPR-Cas9-based zebrafish model systems (Aim 2b). Lastly, we investigate the functional impact of prioritized genes using CRISPR-Cas9 in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiated into relevant cell types (Aim 3a) and tissue-specific transcriptomic analyses in transgenic zebrafish model systems (Aim 3b).  Our focus on obesity-associated loci with protective effects on health (and vice versa) is unique and targets a biology that has not been accessed with single-trait GWAS. Our approaches that use model systems to prioritize and characterize genes are innovative and will provide the critical insights needed for in-depth follow- up in murine models and clinical studies. Some identified genes may point towards actionable targets for the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications with clinical impact for the general population. "
"9444304","Core 3: Instrumentation & Software Resource Core Abstract The goal of the Instrumentation and Software Resource Core (ISRC) is to support our team research efforts by developing and maintaining custom experimental instruments and analysis software. Dr. Michael Dickinson will serve as lead PI for the Core, and we will recruit a staff member with training in computer engineering and instrumentation to run the Core. The ISRC will design, fabricate, and support new instruments, including the development of analysis software. Caltech will provide support for the ISRC effort by providing facilities available through their existing Center for Neurotechnology. Although the primary goal the ISRC is to support the research within our team project, our design strategy will ensure that all the tools we develop will be disseminate freely through the research community. The ISRC will work in concert with the Data Sciences Resource Core (DSRT) to ensure that all data formats from new instruments satisfy the requirements for ease of storage and dissemination. Through principled design we will ensure that all new instrumentation employs state-of-the art standards for compression, short and long-term storage capabilities, and format longevity. By developing all instruments using industry-standard CAD software formats and the use of modern fabrication practices, we will make all of our instruments and associated software available to the general neuroscience community. For the most challenging tasks, such as the development of virtual reality systems or real-time machine vision behavioral tracking, we will utilize a powerful set of software tools called ROS (Robot Operating System, www.ros.org), which is a framework for software development specialized for robotic applications.

These entities are overseen by the Clinical Cancer Research  Committee, which reports to the Cancer Center's Deputy Director. The SCC has three PRMCs; two ?general?  committees, each of which meets monthly, and one reserved for Population Studies. PRMC1 and PRMC2  have the same responsibilities, but were created with staggered meeting dates so as to allow more timely  review and approval of new protocols. The Population Sciences PRMC is responsible for protocols related to  Population Sciences and Cancer Control.  The three PRMCs review and monitor all cancer-related clinical studies for scientific merit prior to IRB review.  The PRMCs have the authority to open protocols that meet the scientific merit and scientific priorities of the  SCC, and to close protocols that do not demonstrate scientific progress. The focus of the PRMCs is on  scientific merit, study prioritization, and progress of Cancer Center clinical trials. Studies which have already  undergone rigorous peer review at the national level, such as NCI-approved national cooperative group studies  are reviewed administratively by the PRMC Chair."
"9563540","The incretins, GIP and GLP-1, are gut hormones secreted in response to nutrients. They have key roles in setting the tone of postprandial metabolism. Pancreatic ?-cells are a principal target of the incretins: about 50% of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is the result of incretin activity. Incretins have effects beyond ?-cells. For example, GIP enhances insulin-sensitivity of adipocytes, reinforcing a postprandial anabolic metabolism in those cells. Because of the ?pro-insulin? activity of the incretins (i.e., enhanced insulin secretion and action), they are excellent targets to treat insulin resistance. Some of this therapeutic promise has already been met, as drugs that target incretins are currently in use. The effects of incretins on whole body physiology, though complex, are fairly well described. More significant gaps remain in our knowledge of incretin biology at the cellular level, which is especially true for GIP. The objective of this project is to address those gaps by a thorough examination of incretin receptor biology. Incretins signal by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is well established that the post-activation trafficking of GPCRs contributes significantly to their biological effects. We have established the tools to study the behavior of the GIP receptor (GIPR) in adipocytes, a physiologically relevant cell type. Using those tools, we have: i) defined the effect of GIP effect on cultured adipocytes; ii) established specialized GIPR trafficking that does not conform to canonical GPCR behavior; and iii) established aberrant intracellular trafficking of a human GIPR coding variant (Q354E) associated with human metabolic alterations. In this application I propose to build on that foundation to further define incretin biology at the cellular level and to extend that knowledge to whole animal studies. We will: 1) Characterize ?-Arrestin2 regulation of GIPR trafficking and control of GIPR enhancement of insulin action in adipocytes. 2) Define trafficking of the incretin receptors (GIPR and GLP-1) in ?-cells, revealing how the behavior/activity of one receptor influences the behavior/activity of the other. 3) Investigate the impact of the GIPR-Q354 on metabolism in studies of mice whose endogenous GIPR  has been engineered to model the human GIPR-Q354, which will provide unique insights into the  physiological disruptions induced by altered post-activation trafficking of the GIPR. This project addresses significant gaps in knowledge of incretin biology, an enhanced understanding that will inform future efforts to harness the incretin system in the treatment of metabolic diseases."

"9356311","PROJECT SUMMARY  Single cell RNA-seq and other transformative genomic technologies provide the opportunity to take human  immunology to the next level of cellular detail, defining individual cells in greater orders of magnitude than  previously possible. As a disease of great cellular heterogeneity, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is ripe to be  impacted by single cell technologies. The Genomics and Data Management Core (GDMC) will provide state-  of-the-art genomics technologies and all data management capabilities for the proposed Center for Lupus  Research. A major contribution of the GDMC will be to provide and develop the technology to analyze SLE  patient samples with single cell resolution. Applying single cell technologies will help to define cell type  characteristics in these patient populations, allow for specific comparisons between patient versus normal cell  types and could potentially define new cell types associated with SLE and/or molecular subtypes of disease.  Single cell RNA-seq will be used as a discovery tool to define cell populations and identify cell-type-specific  markers. The flow and mass cytometry applications will utilize this information to develop new panels of  antibodies that can be applied with greater throughput than single cell transcriptomics (i.e. on more patients  and with greater numbers of cells per sample). Ultimately, the development of such a cellular phenotyping  approach will enable improved stratification of SLE patients. In addition, the GDMC aims to provide the single  cell tools to functionally interrogate new cell populations and pathways revealed by the resolving power of  single cell transcriptomics, thus potentially uncovering new strategies for SLE therapeutics. The data  management activities of the GDMC will ensure a unified and robust approach to experimental design and  analysis for both research projects of the Center. GDMC will be responsible for the flow of data and information  across all components of the Center and will be responsible for the submission of completed data sets/projects  to the appropriate public archives. The Specific Aims for the GDMC are to 1) Provide state-of-the-art single  cell transcriptomic technologies; 2) Provide state-of-the-art cellular phenotyping; and 3) Provide central  storage, management and information security for data generated by the Center for Lupus Research. The core  will thus fulfill essential scientific and translational needs across the Center through the application of powerful  genomic technologies combined with expert data analysis and management support."
"9386949","Our Collaborative Center ?Eyes of Africa: The Genetics of Blindness? will address the staggering economic, societal, and personal cost of irreversible blindness in Africa. The most common cause of permanent blindness in Africa is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), which is the dominant type of glaucoma in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Multiple studies have found that glaucoma disproportionately affects people of African versus European ancestry. As a disease, POAG constitutes the single greatest cause of permanent blindness in Africa and for this reason is the focus of this proposal. We will identify new susceptibility genes for POAG in order to lay the foundation for novel therapeutic intervention, conduct the Sub-Saharan Africa Glaucoma Laser Trial (SSA-GLT) to identify the optimal approach for early treatment of glaucoma and conduct Targeted Glaucoma Screening in Sub Saharan Africa (TGS-SSA): An approach to identify glaucoma early and increase awareness of glaucoma in Sub-Saharan Africa. Successful completion will identify pre-symptomatic glaucoma for treatment, educate families about the disease, and identify highly penetrant mutations that give rise to early onset glaucoma. Our Collaborative Center will fight blindness in Africa in in multiple complementary and synergistic ways that address critical approaches to identify, treat, and understand POAG in Africa. We will build upon our existing large dataset of genotyped samples, expanding this resource using our extensive group of active subject recruitment sites distributed across Africa. In short, this proposal is designed to provide both an immediate and a long-lasting impact to reduce blindness in Africa."

"9386793","Project Summary The goal of the proposed work is to characterize the transgenerational genomic impact of genocide exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women survivors of the Rwandan genocide and their offspring. PTSD is a common and debilitating mental disorder that has a profound public health impact. Between April and June 1994, almost one million people died in the Rwandan genocide against ethnic Tutsi. Twenty years later the long-term impact is illustrated by the prevalence of PTSD in Rwandan adults at 26.1 % and there is strong evidence pointing towards the transgenerational transmission of PTSD. PTSD has a known etiologic component: exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor involving life threat, which induces a biological cascade that includes epigenetic modification of loci whose activity contributes to psychopathological development. In addition, our study in Rwanda showed that transmission of PTSD to the offspring of genocide-exposed mothers was associated with transmission of biological alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and epigenetic modifications of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) gene, a key player in the glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network (GRRN). Building upon these recent findings, the proposed work seeks to characterize the transgenerational epigenetic effects of PTSD and trauma exposure due to the Rwandan genocide. We will employ genome-scale technologies and focus initial analyses on regulation of GRRN and related HPA axis genes, which have been associated with PTSD in recent genome-wide work. Specifically, we will test 100 DNA samples from our existing biobank, previously established in support of our pilot study. We will extend the existing biobank by collecting new specimens from women who were pregnant during the Rwandan genocide and their resulting children, as well their younger siblings, and a demographically matched, non-genocide exposed control group. We will perform additional analyses on a subsample of these specimens both in Rwanda and through the H3Africa network to test additional hypotheses. Our proposal is directly aimed at a key mission of RFA-RM-16-015, to support human genomics research that will not only generate important findings relevant to human health, but also serve as a vehicle to improve the research capacity of African laboratories and scientists at the institutions where the research is carried out. It also directly addresses NIMH strategic objectives 1.2: Identify the genomic and non-genomic factors associated with mental illnesses and 2.1: Characterize the developmental trajectories of brain maturation and dimensions of behavior to understand the roots of mental illnesses across diverse populations. The unique collaboration between the University of Rwanda, the University of Illinois and members of the H3Africa Network will also strengthen the capacity of scientific research through scientific training in Rwanda."
"9304704","Illness due to pathogenic bacteria such Salmonella and E. Coli pose a significant public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that every year Salmonella alone causes one million foodborne illnesses leading to 19,000 hospitalizations, and 380 deaths. Compounds that are able to mitigate the infectivity of pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella and E. Coli, could play an important role in our ability to prevent, or at least reduce the incidence of, food borne illness. Curli are a class of cell surface filaments found in Escherichia and Salmonella spp. Curli, comprised mainly of the oligomerized protein subunit CsgA, are thought to facilitate bacterial surface colonization, long-term survival, and bacterial cell-cell association, and appear to play a vital role in host infection. Given its apparent role in bacterial survival, inhibition of CsgA oligomerization to form curli is thought to be a promising avenue for the development of novel agents that reduce bacterial viability and infection. However, our ability to exploit curli biogenesis in the development of novel therapeutic agents is limited due to scant mechanistic information available on curli assembly. The overall goal of our investigations in our laboratory is to determine the mechanism of curli biogenesis. Curli formation is thought to be mediated by at least six different proteins: CsgA, CagB, CsgC, CsgE, CsgF, and CsgG. CsgA and CsgB are the structural subunits of curli with CsgA present as the major, and CsgB the minor, protein components. Although CsgA and CsgB are synthesized in the cytosol, the assembly of these proteins into curli occurs on the cell surface. It has been postulated that two proteins, CsgE and CsgF act as chaperones to prevent the improper aggregation of CsgA and/or CsgB until these proteins are properly localized on the extracellular surface where they form curli. Based on sequence analysis, and circular dichroism, we found that CsgE and CsgF contain significant regions that lack defined secondary structure, and posited that the two proteins may be intrinsically disordered with the disordered regions serving as sites of protein interaction. In the studies proposed herein we aim determine the details of the interaction between the curli assembly chaperon proteins, CsgE and CsgF, and the curli structural proteins CsgA and CsgB. Determining the molecular details of CsgA assembly may help us elucidate the details of curli formation and, in the long-term, aid in the development of novel, fimbriae based, therapies to reduce long-term pathogen survival and persistence."

"9533101","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are transfused primarily to increase oxygen use by cells to prevent the development of shock in critically ill patients. Inadequate treatment of shock will increase the risk of multiple organ failure and mortality through multiple cell death pathways. RBC units can be stored for up to 42 days based upon RBC survival data within the central circulation. There is no data indicating RBCs stored up to 42 days are efficacious in improving oxygen use at the cellular level during shock. Preliminary evidence indicates that in critically ill populations, including children, increased RBC storage duration reduces its efficacy and may increase the risk of organ failure and mortality. The Age of Blood in Children in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (ABC-PICU) trial has been designed to determine if the use of RBCs of short storage duration improves outcomes in this population. ABC-PICU is a multicenter international, pragmatic, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the risk of New or Progressive Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (NPMODS) in 1538 critically ill children transfused either RBCs of decreased storage age or standard issue RBCs (oldest in inventory first). We hypothesize that transfusion of RBCs stored for ? 7 days (compared to standard issue RBCs) will result in improved clinical outcomes by decreasing NPMODS. Specific Aim 1: Determine whether transfusion of RBC units ? 7 days compared to standard issue (mean 17- 21 days) RBC units decreases the risk of NPMODS in critically ill children. The primary outcome measure NPMODS is defined as the proportion of patients who develop NPMODS or die during the 28 days after randomization. Specific Aim 2: Secondary outcomes will include morbidity and measures to include; transfusion reactions, adverse thrombotic events, nosocomial infections, mechanical ventilation and ICU free days, and mortality at multiple time intervals. If this adequately powered trial does not indicate RBC storage age effects outcomes, the results would reassure clinicians and blood bankers regarding the efficacy and safety of RBC transfusions in critically ill children. If results indicate that RBCs ? 7 days improve outcomes this will: 1) indicate that prolonged storage has clinical consequences and may influence the modification of regulatory policies on RBC storage; 2) potentially influence policies regarding the storage age of RBCs allocated to critically ill children and; 3) spark investment in research of RBC storage and rejuvenation solutions to mitigate any potential adverse effects of storage. Positive results would also encourage research directed at understanding the mechanisms underlying the improved outcomes in children transfused RBCs of decreased storage age."

As South Carolina's leading academic medical center, MUSC is charged with building clinical, basic, translational, and population-based research programs that address the state's significant healthcare needs. The mission of the HCC is to reduce the cancer burden in South Carolina. To accomplish this mission, the Director, Dr. Andrew S. Kraft, and the HCC senior leadership have established a robust, interdisciplinary base that now includes 122 cancer scientists from 5 MUSC colleges and 20 academic departments.         Interdisciplinary, innovative research is driven through the organization of the HCC into four programs: Cancer Genes & Molecular Regulation, Cancer Immunology, Developmental Cancer Therapeutics, and Cancer Control. The rapid pace of discovery and movement toward effective translational research is supported by shared research resources, five of which are presented in this application: Lipidomics, Cell Evaluation & Therapy, Cell & Molecular Imaging, Biorepository & Tissue Analysis, and Biostatistics. The HCC also seeks CCSG support for its Clinical Trials Office which has spear-headed a dramatic 59% increase in accrual volume for interventional treatment trials over the last four years. Notably, 26% of patients enrolled onto interventional treatment trials in 2012 were minorities, representing a 45% increase in this project period. This has been promoted by HCC-led progressive outreach services and cancer education to South Carolinians, a largely rural population that includes some of the most medically underserved people in the US. Today, the HCC has $40.8M in annual total extramural research funding with $18.6M derived from the NCI, representing a 31% and 54% increase, respectively, since 2009. The HCC has successfully leveraged CCSG funding during the first project period and its NCI-designated Cancer Center status to continue the rapid growth of this Center. During the current project period, the HCC supported 34 strategic recruitments to the Center. The opening of two state-of-the-art research facilities at MUSC, the Bioengineering and Drug Discovery Buildings, has resulted in an additional 66,156 ft? of HCC research space, bringing the total amount of space on campus under the HCC authority to 270,174 ft?. The HCC has invested $5.3M since 2009 to introduce cutting-edge technologies and has secured another $3.8M in institutional commitments to increase the range of available resources. These impressive developments ensure that HCC scientists will continue their exemplary track record in making significant contributions to the understanding of cancer biology while coupling these findings to the development of novel approaches to cancer control, diagnosis, and treatment."
"9474435","This Phase I SBIR develops and tests feasibility of the Flexible Pancreatic Ablation (FPA) system to endoscopically treat pancreatic tumors. The FPA deploys through an endoscope and into heterogeneous pancreatic tissue with a vibrating head consisting of an array of fine, flexible tines that expand into a predetermined shape. The vibration and geometry of the tines improve tissue penetration and trajectory accuracy to enable complete tumor ablation without destroying healthy tissue. Public Health Problem: Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with poor prognosis and short survival. Although it accounts for 3% of new cancer cases overall each year ? an occurrence nearly 80% less than breast cancer ? the estimated number of deaths in 2016 surpassed that of breast cancer, making it the third most deadly cancer (41,780 estimated deaths) in the U.S. This is due in part to its typically late stage diagnosis, which limits eligibility for the preferred treatment of surgical resection to only 20% of patients. Resection is preferred because other percutaneous methods such as laparoscopy using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have shown similar risks but lower efficacy due to anatomical obstructions and surgical route. Endoscopic techniques are advancing, but are so far limited in scope or capabilities. RFA needles generate set ellipsoidal ablation zones which may not match the shape of tumors. Unlike other organs, damaged pancreatic tissue cannot regenerate; therefore, healthy tissue must be preserved if possible. The pancreatic tissue heterogeneity can also complicate procedures with lengthy, thin, flexible ablation probes ? soft structures can compress and relax, resulting in uncertainty in insertion depth, and harder structures can resist piercing and redirect the probe path. An advanced endoscopic accessory is needed that can fully ablate pancreatic tumors while minimizing patient complications and destruction of healthy tissue ? and provide an effective treatment choice for the 80% of patients with limited options for survival. Phase I Hypothesis. Feasibility of improved endoscopic therapy of pancreatic cancer is demonstrated by deployment of tines and production of spherical ablation zones using the FPA tool in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aims: Aim 1 ? Develop FPA handheld prototype and demonstrate improved FPA effector expansion with vibration. Acceptance Criteria: FPA maintains ?80% effector expansion and produces ROF of ?50% with vibration in all endoscopic phantom insertions (?150 mm/sec, 2-15 kPa stiffness). Aim 2 ? Show efficacy of tissue ablation in vitro and insertion testing in heterogeneous models. Acceptance Criteria: Validate thermal models and demonstrate improved lesion shape to needle ablation with 2-2.5 cm ablation zone in vitro. Demonstrate effective deployment in heterogeneous tissues. Aim 3 ? Endoscopic demonstration of ablation zone in pancreas using FPA in preliminary preclinical study. Acceptance Criteria: In vivo (N=3) ablation volume is within 20% of simulations. No adverse effects from ablation procedure during 7-day survival."
"9439844","Inadequate wound healing, resulting in chronic wounds, is a major and increasing U.S. health problem, due to the rising incidence of diabetes and our aging population. Innate immune responses to tissue injury are critical to wound repair. Monocyte/macrophages, both recruited and tissue-resident, secrete factors that are critical mediators of the early proliferative and regenerative wound healing phases. Little attention has been paid to posttranscriptional regulatory influences on gene expression in wound localized macrophages. This is a major checkpoint in macrophage-dependent wound repair, since a majority of influential macrophage-derived products are encoded by mRNAs that bear both AU-rich elements (AREs) and numerous microRNA (miRNA) binding sites in their 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). That is, a transcriptional activation trigger is often insufficient for adequate gene expression. In particular, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) protect vulnerable 3'UTRs from miRNA binding and consequent translational arrest (and/or mRNA degradation). We have recently demonstrated that macrophage ?2 integrin engagement results in dynamic modulation of the RBP HuR, which protects numerous 3'UTR ARE-bearing mRNAs from degradation or translation blocks. We have shown that macrophage HuR gene-deleted mice have repair defects in multiple wound models. In dynamic fashion, HuR has the ability to relieve miRNA-mediated gene expression constraints. Our hypothesis is that expression of a set of wound healing-promoting genes, both overlapping and distinct in recruited vs. tissue- resident macrophages, is driven by HuR-dependent release of miRNA-mediated translation blocks. We have generated unique, macrophage-specific translational profiling tools, and now propose to: (1) document the presence of candidate, and define novel, macrophage mRNAs undergoing active, HuR-dependent translation in early wound healing responses, using the Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) assay, with pulldowns of the ribosomal fusion protein L10a-EGFP, expressed in myeloid cell-specific fashion, in HuR wild- type or gene-deleted mice; (2) define miRNAs that target those TRAP-defined mRNAs, with biotin-3'UTR riboprobe pulldowns of FACS-sorted L10a-EGFP+, wound localized macrophage extracts, confirming their translation-repressing effects in dual luciferase 3'UTR reporter assays; and (3) release the miRNA-mediated translational constraint on wound healing-promoting mRNAs, topically applying miRNA target site blocker oligonucleotides which interfere with binding to specific mRNA 3'UTR target sites, in dorsal full thickness excisional and ear punch hole wound models, assessing wound area, re-epithelialization, revascularization and fibroblast repopulation. These molecular and preclinical approaches, directed at a gene expression regulatory switch in wound-responsive macrophages, will provide mechanistic insight with therapeutic implications."

"9470666","Abstract Obesity and diabetes are worldwide challenges. Bariatric procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) are the most effective and long-term treatment for obesity and its associated comorbidities such as diabetes. Interestingly, the metabolic improvements such as glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity following bariatric surgeries occur prior to any significant weight loss. The mechanisms responsible for these improvements are unknown but recent findings have identified bile acids as the major contributor to these metabolic benefits. It is now clear that bile acids have hormonal activity and are involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and energy expenditure. Our laboratory has been successful in establishing mouse models of RYGB and VSG similar to those performed clinically. In an attempt to understand the potential role of bile acids in the metabolic improvements seen after bariatric procedures, we have developed a new mouse model that enables diversion of bile acids to ileum (GB-IL) without altering the anatomy of the stomach. Our recent observations demonstrate that GB-IL leads to more weight loss and metabolic improvement compared to RYGB. These findings were linked to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) that is highly expressed in the intestine and liver. FXR is the major regulator of bile acid synthesis by controlling the expression of cholesterol 7?-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis pathway. In this proposal we will investigate the role of intestinal FXR in mediating the metabolic improvements after bariatric surgery. To address this, we will perform RYGB, VSG, and GB-IL in diet induced obese mice and compare the results to sham-operated control group. . As the secondary aim, we will also investigate the impact of absence of intestinal FXR in bile acid pool and composition on the observed metabolic benefits after bariatric surgery. In this regard we will perform the same bariatric procedures as first aim in two additional groups of mice: wild type and intestinal-FXR knockout. This work will lead to better understanding of the role of FXR signaling in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity and bile acids contribution to this complex interaction. The findings of this proposal may help develop novel therapeutics and potentially more effective surgical procedures for obesity and diabetes."
"9429362","The long-term goal of this research is to resolve molecular and cellular substrates for high-functioning autism. We will develop mouse models for human de novo mutations in ANK2, one of the few genes associated with autism in the absence of intellectual disability, developmental delay, or seizures. ANK2 encodes 220 kDa ankyrin-B (ankB) which is widely expressed, and 440 kDa ankB which is found only in neurons and is localized to unmyelinated axons and growth cones. The distribution of human de novo mutations suggests that mutation of 440 kDa ankB is sufficient to cause high function autism. We have generated mice modeling a human de novo ANK2 frameshift mutation that selectively depletes 440 kDa ankB. We will explore the hypothesis that mutation/deficiency of 440 kDa ankB selectively perturbs both local and long-range neural connectivity through altered axonal function as follows. 1. Resolve the molecular basis for increased axon growth/branching observed in 440 kDa ankB mutant neurons, and establish a cellular assay to evaluate human 440 kDa ankB variants. Neurons cultured from mice lacking 440 kDa ankB exhibit increased axon length and branching. We will explore the roles in this phenomenon of cytoskeletal dynamics and exocytosis. We also will develop a rescue strategy to evaluate functional consequences of human variants of 440 kDa ankB on axon growth/branching. 2. Determine consequences of 440 kDa ankB mutation for establishment of local and long-range neural connectivity during postnatal brain development. 440 kDa ankB-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical synaptogenesis as well as loss of interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L1CAM. Since L1CAM requires ankyrin-binding activity for long distance axon pathfinding, we hypothesize that 440 kDa ankB-deficient neurons will exhibit abnormal axon targeting. We will evaluate local and long-range targeting of axons of during development in 440 kDa ankB-deficient mice using a) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) b) imaging of axons of cortical neurons sparsely labeled by stereotactic injection of AAV GFP/Cherry constructs; c) analysis of excitatory and inhibitory forebrain synapses during development using immunofluorescence and electrophysiology. 3. Determine a reproducible behavioral phenotype for 440 kDa ankB mutant mice. In collaboration with Drs. William Wetsel (Director of the Duke Mouse Behavioral and Neuroendocrine Analysis Core Facility) and Henry Yin (Duke Department of Psychology and Neuroscience) and co-investigators on this proposal, we will evaluate social behavior, cognition, sensory-motor gating, and repetitive/anxiety-like behavior. In addition, in collaboration with Henry Yin, we will use computer-assisted analysis of 3D imaging to develop an unbiased reproducible behavior profile. These studies of cellular and in vivo consequences of de novo ANK2 mutation promise to provide the first mechanistic insights into high functioning forms of autism."
"9274498","ABSTRACT The significant challenge underlying metabolomics studies is that lack of annotation for the vast chemical space despite efforts to catalogue the human metabolome and to develop more comprehensive mass spectrometry- based libraries of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. Consequently, application of high resolution and high mass accuracy mass spectrometry is critical to the interpretation of unknowns, and the unique features (high resolution, MSn) of the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer will be integral toward structural elucidation of these unknowns. Acquisition of the new Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid will provide both additional capacity and capabilities for The Pennsylvania State University Metabolomics Facility. The projects described herein will receive priority access to the new instrument and occupy the majority of the AUT. While off-loading these project samples to the new instruments will free up some service hours from existing instruments, some of these project refinements will generate additional sample runs to fully exploit the enhanced potential for characterizing the metabolome and biochemical pathways. However, the Metabolomics Facility also has a backlog of sample run requests from new users and for new projects, and these will rapidly fill in any runtime on other instruments. We describe in detail nine projects that require the unique capabilities of the Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid. The new capabilities of this instrument are essential for the success of NIH-funded investigators as the currently available instrumentation both on campus and in neighboring institutions is not sufficient in terms of sensitivity and resolution to complete the proposed studies. The instrument will be housed in the state-of-the-art metabolomics facility at The Pennsylvania State University and will be invaluable not only as a research tool but also a means for educating undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and investigators throughout the university. Overall The Pennsylvania State University has made a strong commitment to support this new platform by supporting its operation for seven years, fully funding the salary of a research associate for two years, and supporting the salary of the facility director."
"9357372","Project Summary Globally, the number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is approaching 350 million [1]. With this number rapidly rising, the urgent need for effective therapeutics to treat this disease is also increasing. Research efforts have produced significant advances in treatment options, including the introduction of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors to improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and lower blood glucose. Despite these advances, there remains a gap in the normalization of glucose and the prevention of complications among the population that current treatments have been unable to address, leaving millions of patients with insufficient and unsafe levels of glucose control. Recently, a protease enzyme called fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of T2D and obesity [2]. FAP is the most closely related enzyme to DPP4 [3, 4], a validated drug target. Multiple pharmacological inhibitors of DPP4 are now widely used in patients with T2D [5]. Previous interest in FAP has focused on its potential as a target for cancer therapy due to its upregulation in epithelial tumors [6]. However, recent FAP-specific activity assays have identified FAP activity in the circulation, as well as in several tissues with roles in metabolic regulation [7]. Most intriguingly, preliminary characterization of a global FAP knockout (Fap-/-) mouse demonstrated a) significant protection against diet-induced obesity and b) improved glycemia, phenotypic findings similar to those described in the global DPP4 knockout (Dpp4-/-) mouse [2]. Importantly, FAP has a unique endopeptidase activity, suggesting that its enzymatic targets are different from those of DPP4. Thus, FAP inhibition may provide a novel route to treatment of diabetes. We have independently generated mutant Fap-/- mice, enabling us to determine the metabolic phenotype ensuing from genetic FAP deficiency. Complementary experiments will utilize a potent and specific FAP inhibitor, compound 5057, to determine whether pharmacological FAP inhibition produces the same metabolic benefits observed in Fap-/- mice. Fap-/- mice and wild-type mice treated with compound 5057 will be employed to identify physiological mechanisms (and FAP substrates) underlying the metabolic benefits of FAP inactivation. We are hopeful that this research will lay the groundwork for clinical testing of a new class of drugs for the treatment of T2D."

"9370686","To date, most existing cellular or immunological evaluations of psoriasis inflammation have been limited by  the low-resolution data used for analysis and often rely on gross clinical endpoints. The overall goal of the  CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental  approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for  psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Systems biology provides an unbiased approach to  generating a comprehensive assessment of the host responses involved in psoriasis-mediated inflammation  that may lead to new therapy targets for psoriasis and ideally, those tailored for the specific patient. This  evolving investigative paradigm driven by modern high-throughput technologies that generate enormous  datasets (?Big Data?) has engendered the need for a centralized ?omics core service and analysis platforms  that the CORT Applied Meta?Omics Core (AMC) will provide. The AMC is designed to serve as an innovative  collaborative resource with bidirectional experimental ties to the Collaborative Research Project (CRP) and  Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC). The AMC will receive samples from the CRP and PMC, generate  transcriptomic, metabolomic, microbiome and mycobiome datasets, and provide the bioinformatic pipelines to  analyze those datasets in conjunction with clinical outcomes and/or other data types, including incorporation of  artificial intelligence, data mining, network techniques and machine learning to enable identification of novel  pathways and differentially-expressed gene targets that will allow for identification of new and/or re-purposed  drugs. The AMC supports the CORT CRP?s overall objectives via the following aims: (1) perform SOP-driven  sample acquisition, sample preparation, and ?omic assays for the PMC and CRP; (2) identify differential  metabolomic, gene and pathway expression signatures, as well as changes in the micro/mycobiome, between  psoriatic involved, uninvolved and control skin from human and psoriasiform murine models for the CRP; (3) (i)  identify systems biology donor profiles (endotypes) and candidate biomarkers that may define the  pathogenesis of psoriasis in humans and mouse models and (ii) identify FDA-approved drugs that are  predicted to target the biomarkers and/or pathways associated with psoriasis. Highly interactive Cores  synergistically interacting with the central CRP, the AMC team's expertise, innovation and extensive resources  will drive the CORT's transforming and sustainable impact on psoriasis understanding and clinical care. The  AMC will shed deeper insight into the pathological events in psoriasis, which can be translated into targeted  diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to manage psoriasis at the individual level. By combining  myco/microbiome, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses to identify pathological or protective correlates  that are perturbed in disease, as well as their predicted drug targets, the AMC is envisioned to be critical in  supporting the PMC and CRP in their goals of targeted therapeutics and precision, individualized treatments."
"9322033","PROJECT SUMMARY: The goal of My Health My Future is to develop and test the efficacy of a self-care intervention for sexual health promotion among American Indian youth and young adults through an assets-based approach. The study population is the White Mountain Apache Tribe (Apache), who have a 30-year history of pioneering research in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health (JHU). The intervention will advance a new line of sexual health self-care research and includes a brief self-assessment, corresponding personalized messaging delivered via text, phone and email, and non-clinic based alternatives for STI screening and HPV immunization. The intervention will be rooted in asset theory, which is congruent with Native beliefs about wellness, and a positive youth development framework. Apaches ages 11-26 (n=312) will be individually randomized to receive the self-care intervention or comparison condition (standard of care). We will evaluate the impact of the self-care intervention vs. comparison on the primary outcome of STI screening uptake among sexually active youth. Secondary outcomes will include: a) sexual risk and protective behaviors; b) HPV vaccine coverage (completion of doses 2 or 3); and c) psychosocial assets and resources. All outcomes will be evaluated via Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview technology at baseline and 6-months post-intervention. A subset of outcomes will be measured bi- weekly via text message throughout the follow-up time period. This proposal is urgent, innovative and has potential for significant impact because: 1) American Indian youth and young adults have the highest rates of STIs in the US; 2) American Indians have high incidence and mortality from cervical cancer but low uptake of HPV vaccination by youth; 3) alternatives to provider-driven, clinic-based treatment are needed in communities where sexual health disparities are perpetuated by differential access to care, geographic isolation and confidentiality concerns; and 4) the Apache-JHU research team has successfully demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of self-management and assets- based approaches to improving health outcomes in past NARCH endeavors. If study aims are achieved, we will have a novel, self-care intervention available for American Indian communities that seek alternative strategies for sexual health care."
"9449733","PROJECT SUMMARY Epithelial-stromal interactions are critical determinants of epithelial cell behavior in a tumor. While the stromal microenvironment and alterations in the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM), influences invasive and migratory properties at the invasive front, the role of the epithelial matrix in influencing cancer cell behavior are less well understood. Extracellular matrix (ECM) perturbations in epithelial cancers contribute to metastatic spread accounting for 80% of the cancer-related deaths worldwide. The molecular cues that affect the ECM and precede stromal influences on epithelial cell metastasis, is a critical first step at identifying pathways that can be molecularly targeted in the future. The overarching goal of this project is to determine whether alterations in the extracellular matrix of cancer epithelial cells can sufficiently alter cancer cell invasion, migration and metastatic propensity. Fibronectin (FN) matrix dysregulation in response to hypoxia using hypoxia mimetics and 1% O2 will be investigated in the MCF10A progression series to determine whether cellular responses in the three cell lines alternate between premalignant and malignant phenotypes or preinvasive and invasive phenotypes. During low O2 levels in the cells, Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1? and HIF2? proteins undergo stabilization and translocate to the nucleus to enable transcription of genes involved in cell survival, angiogenesis, and metabolism. An angiogenic transcriptional target of HIF? is VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor), which interacts with the C-terminal Heparin-II domain of the FN protein. Using non-contacting and contacting transwell assays, with endothelial cells, the role of FN fibrillogenesis in binding VEGF or releasing VEGF to promote angiogenesis will be determined. While breast cell lines are used in this study, the project goal applies to epithelial cancer cell invasion and migration and hypoxia- mediated angiogenesis that depend on FN fibrillogenesis. The long-term goal of this study is to provide new information on unfavorable FN matrix changes that can be perhaps stabilized that in combination with existing therapeutic strategies will help alleviate cancer cell aggression."
"9462460","Upper limb muscle stiffness and spasticity after stroke are associated with reduced functional independence and a significant increase in health care costs. If left untreated, it leads to joint contractures, further disability, and increases the economic burden. Spasticity develops as a result of central nervous system injury, which leads to a velocity-dependent increase in stretch reflexes because of decreased cortical influence on the spinal cord. However, secondary changes within the muscles and connective tissue also contribute to muscle stiffness that increase the passive resistance to stretch. The precise non-neural mechanisms and their interaction with neural mechanisms are not well understood, and there are currently no approved medications for treatment of changes in muscle mechanical properties. We proposed the hyaluronan hypothesis, which postulates that the accumulation of hyaluronan within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of muscles promotes the development of muscle stiffness. Hyaluronan is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that acts as a lubricant to facilitate intramuscular and intermuscular sliding under physiological conditions. However, when its concentration is increased because of paresis and reduced mobility, it aggregates and makes the ECM hyper-viscous, which can lead to decreased sliding of the muscle fibers and fascicles, muscle shortening, and increased muscle stiffness. Untreated, the increased concentration of hyaluronan can lead to subsequent fibrosis and contracture. We have found that intramuscular injections of the FDA-approved enzyme hyaluronidase, which hydrolyzes long-chained hyaluronan polymers to smaller polymers, can reduce muscle stiffness and increase passive and active range of motion in patients with moderately-severe upper limb spasticity within a few days. Importantly, this effect persists for at least 3 months. These results suggest that reducing muscle hyaluronan concentrations with hyaluronidase is a feasible treatment for muscle stiffness. We now propose to identify the potential mechanisms and test the efficacy of using human recombinant hyaluronidase for treating muscle stiffness. Our central hypothesis is that hyaluronidase will enhance upper limb motor outcomes by modulating peripheral non-neural mechanisms, and reducing the GAG content and viscosity in muscles. We will conduct a proof-of-principle double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of human recombinant hyaluronidase injections in patients with post-stroke upper limb muscle stiffness to test this hypothesis. The specific aims are to: test the effect of hyaluronidase on upper limb motor outcomes (Aim 1); evaluate the effect of hyaluronidase on neural and non-neural components of muscle stiffness (Aim 2); and elucidate the effect of hyaluronidase on intramuscular GAG content quantified non-invasively by proton T1? relaxation mapping on muscle MRI (Aim 3). At its conclusion, this study will provide mechanistic and behavioral evidence for a novel, practical, and potentially transforming approach to treat muscle stiffness and reduce the burden of disability after neurological injury."
"9485641","Abstract The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core (CEDC) will build upon already established relationships in the community to provide researchers and community members with the recognized need of community engagement in academia, where the value of research evidence and community wisdom will provide effective strategies to address health disparities. This multi-faceted approach will ensure the Center?s meaningful community participation in research, training, and dissemination activates. Recognizing that effective community partnerships are constructed over time through trust, respect, and commitment, the strategies and tasks of the CEDC will be to foster and support the emergence of community engaged or participatory research relationships. Two aims are proposed to accomplish this goal, which will build the capacity of UNTHSC researchers and community partners to establish strong equitable and productive partnerships that address community needs and result in translatable action and impact. The two aims of the CEDC are 1) promote productive, equitable and collaborative roles for community stakeholders to participate in the design, implementation, interpretation and dissemination of health disparities research and 2) develop a mechanism to disseminate research findings, provide study updates, and describe potential implications with fellow researchers, members of the public, and specific community stakeholders relevant for each substantive area.

"9370747","NYU School of Medicine and collaborating clinical and basic investigators in Medicine and Pathology propose to establish the Translational Center of Molecular Profiling in Preclinical and Established Lupus (COMPEL) comprising 3 Projects, 2 Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. The overarching goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), a prototypic yet clinically and immuno- molecularly heterogeneous autoimmune disease, is initiated and perpetuated. COMPEL leverages a) a unique cohort of asymptomatic women presenting with breakdown in B cell tolerance identified because of neonatal lupus (NL) in an offspring (Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus, RRNL) and b) a robustly phenotyped cohort of established SLE patients spanning diverse racial backgrounds and with a high penetrance of serious illness (NYU Cohort). Project 1 profiles anti-Ro preclinical and clinical autoimmunity to identify blueprints of an immune system that remains preclinical, and in individuals who have progressed to overt disease. The approach rests on identifying associations between host genetics, the microbiome, and the phenotype of CD4+ T cells, which constitute an immune triumvirate of T cells, antigen-presenting cells with an MHC II-defined specificity towards particular microbial taxa, and B cells. Project 2 explores microbiome pathobionts and SLE pathogenesis to understand how specific candidate pathobiont bacterial isolates contribute to overt SLE disease and flares, and to peripheral blood expansion of disease-associated B cell clones. Human intestinal IgA responses can be both specific for in vivo eliciting bacteria, and often cross-reactive with self-antigens. Yet, the gut-associated B cell response has not been investigated in SLE as a driver of autoimmune disease. Project 3 focuses on DNASE1L3, a unique secreted DNase that is essential for protection against SLE. We have shown that DNASE1L3 digests DNA in circulating microparticles and antibody (Ab) reactivity to microparticle antigens is frequently detected in SLE. The project will explore Ab responses to DNASE1L3- sensitive microparticle antigens in preclinical and established SLE patients; molecularly characterize these antigens and test DNASE1L3 as a therapeutic. The Research Technology Core brings advanced technology for NGS applications of large scale autoAb gene repertoire analyses from human B cell samples and will sort intestinal IgA-coated bacteria profiled by 16S rRNA microbiome surveys. The Clinical Core comprises the database (REDCap) and biobank (Freezerworks) of 3 cohorts (RRNL, NYU Lupus Cohort, healthy controls) to facilitate translational studies. The Administrative Core supports organizational, financial and reporting activities. The analytic team brings expertise in biostatics, genetic statistics, bioinformatics and computational science. External advisors covering translational SLE, the microbiome, T cell biology and mucosal immunity, and 2 lay persons with ties to NL, will provide overall review and with COMPEL select Pilot/Feasibility Projects to leverage program resources and expand thematic objectives."
"9420148","Stockpiled during World War II, Phosgene Oxime (CX; dichloroform oxime) is a potent chemical weapon that poses a threat of exposure; both, alone and with other chemical agents. It is an urticant or nettle agent grouped with vesicating agents due to similar damaging properties; although, it causes more severe damage than other vesicants due to its highly reactive nature. Even though it is the most notorious vesicant with special military and terrorist interests, it is one of the least studied chemical warfare agents with no specific antidote available. Information on its effect on human dermal tissue and absorption is limited, and its mechanism of action is unknown. Well defined animal models of exposure to CX are thus essential to study its skin toxicity and for the development of effective treatments. Thus, the ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a relevant cutaneous CX exposure mouse injury model to elucidate mechanisms of skin damage by CX and examine its systemic toxic effects with the objective of identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention and drug development. Our preliminary data show that cutaneous CX vapor exposure (4 min) on to the SKH-1 hairless mouse skin causes edema, erythema, blanching, urticaria and necrosis within 30 min with sustained effects till 8 h post- exposure. The rapid onset of these clinical lesions from cutaneous CX exposure were associated with: a) an increase in apoptotic cell death and p53 phosphorylation indicating a DNA damaging response, b) an inflammatory response associated with i) mast cell degranulation and increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-? and cyclooxygenase-2, and ii) neutrophil infiltration and an increase myeloperoxidase levels. These results suggest that CX possesses alkylating and nucleophilic properties resembling mustard vesicants that can cause DNA damage and an inflammatory response. The skin urticaria from CX resembles urticaria from frequently caused allergic and non-allergic reactions involving an inflammatorily response mainly via histamine release from mast cells. Additionally, the CX-exposure effects were accompanied with dilatation of peripheral vessels with a robust surge in RBCs in vessels of all the major internal organs, which could cause sudden blood pressure fall, hypoxia and death. Based on these findings, our hypothesis is that CX activates inflammatory and p53-DNA damaging pathways that are potential major contributors of CX-induced skin toxic lesions, and that it causes vasculature dilation and blood congestion in multiple organs resulting in systemic toxicity and mortality. Specific aims proposed to test this hypothesis are: 1) Characterize and establish CX- induced in vivo rodent skin injury model following its cutaneous exposure, and identify associated mechanism/s of action; and 2) examine systemic toxic effects and related mortality from CX cutaneous exposure. We anticipate that our studies would establish skin and systemic injury biomarkers of acute CX exposure that can be employed for screening therapies for the rescue of skin injuries and mortality by CX."
"9464793","  Project Summary  Young children?s essentialist views of gender (i.e., that gender is innate, immutable, informative, and discrete) are found to be inflexible in early childhood in all cultures studied to date, which has led researchers to construe of gender essentialism as an early-emerging cognitive default. The proposed work addresses the validity of this belief that gender essentialism is inevitable, by examining the development of gender essentialism among gender nonconforming and gender ?typical? children. Gender nonconforming children (those whose biological gender and internal sense of gender diverge) present a unique opportunity for answering this question, as their own gender identity defies central components of an essentialist outlook on gender (e.g., believing that gender is determined by one?s sex, that gender is discrete, etc). Thus, gender nonconforming children?s own experiences with gender might lead to early non-essentialist beliefs about gender, suggesting that broader theories about essentialism would need to be modified. In this work, we further expand our understanding of essentialism by asking whether essentialism is a domain-general or domain-specific cognitive bias. If essentialism is a domain-general capacity, we expect to find that gender essentialism is related to essentialism of other social categories (e.g., race) and natural kinds (e.g., animals). Further, if GNC children differ from gender typical children in their levels of gender essentialism, they will also differ in their levels of other essentialism. In contrast, if gender essentialism is domain-specific, any differences in gender essentialism will have no implication for other types of essentialism. Our third area of focus involves the socialization of gender essentialism, examining the extent to which gender nonconforming and gender typical children?s gender essentialism mirrors the messages they receive from their parents and communities about gender. Finally, we aim to examine the relation between gender essentialism and prejudice against gender nonconforming children among gender typical children. The literature provides conflicting evidence regarding the relation between essentialism of social categories and prejudice. Because gender nonconforming children tend to experience high levels of discrimination and prejudice by their peers, understanding this link has crucial implications for reducing peer victimization of gender nonconforming children. We will not only examine the link but will also test whether we can change children?s gender essentialism and if so, whether this will result in a reduction of bias against gender nonconforming children. Together this work will not only expand our theoretical understanding of essentialism, but will broaden our understanding of gender nonconformity in early childhood."
"9380735","Project Summary  Bacteria communicate using the cell-cell signaling system called quorum sensing to collectively alter gene expression in response to changes in cell density. Quorum sensing controls behaviors that benefit the group for adaption and survival, including biofilm formation, motility, bioluminescence, and virulence factor secretion. Molecules that modulate quorum sensing have potential use as anti-microbial drugs aimed at bacteria that use quorum sensing to control virulence. Thus, there is a critical need to comprehensively understand how cell-cell signaling regulates virulence and impacts bacteria in their environmental niches. Despite advances in elucidating the quorum signaling inputs, comparatively less is known about the output ? the transcriptional regulation program that controls group behaviors. The objective of my research is to define how bacteria use quorum sensing signaling to control virulence gene expression. Toward this goal, we study quorum sensing gene regulation in Vibrios, both as relevant pathogens and as established quorum sensing model systems. Quorum sensing was first elucidated in bioluminescent Vibrios, and these bacterial systems now serve as exceptional models for the quorum sensing pathways that are mirrored in the human pathogens Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In Vibrios, virulence gene expression is controlled by the LuxR-type master transcription factors at the center of the quorum sensing pathway. My work has shown that quorum sensing and LuxR activate and repress hundreds of genes in response to quorum signals that impinge on cell growth and physiology. My lab will expand this foundation over the next five years to establish links between quorum sensing and gene expression. We have uncovered novel mechanisms of gene regulation by LuxR in concert with nucleoid-associated proteins that are critical for precise timing and expression levels of quorum sensing genes. My lab will extend this work by determining the regulatory mechanism of the central LuxR/HapR proteins in pathogenic Vibrios, which are key targets for developing inhibitors of quorum sensing. Further, we have shown that the quorum sensing pathway intersects other signaling pathways (e.g., the osmotic stress response pathway). We will use temporal, single- cell, and population-level experiments to study how gene expression is coordinated in response to changes in both cell density and the local environment during growth and host colonization. Finally, we are now extending our knowledge and methodological approaches to examine quorum sensing gene regulation in the Mycobacteria, which includes the prevalent human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We have initiated studies to identify the quorum sensing gene network in Mycobacteria and determine its impact on virulence phenotypes. Overall, this work will provide the fundamental data critical to understanding quorum signaling and how it impacts bacterial pathogenesis to contribute to future advances in disease treatment."

"9517613","ABSTRACT For the in vivo investigation of brain connectome, diffusion MRI (dMRI) is an important tool as it provides highly sensitive imaging markers and allows the examination of connection paths via tractography. With the success of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), high resolution, multi-shell diffusion imaging is emerging as the standard approach for dMRI data acquisition in connectome studies. To fully unleash the potential of multi-shell dMRI, in this project we will develop a suite of novel computational tools that jointly estimate fiber orientation distributions (FOD) and compartmental parameters. With FOD-based tractography, we can reliably resolve crossing fibers and reconstruct fiber bundles that faithfully follow known anatomy such as the retinotopy of visual pathways. Compartmental parameters provide sensitive imaging markers for studying local cellular environment surrounding the axons. Our tools are generally applicable for both human and mouse connectome research. One main challenge in diffusion tractography is the lack of rigorous validations with biologically meaningful ground truth. With large-scale tracer injection data of mouse brains from the Mouse Connectome Project (MCP) at USC and the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas, we will perform a systematic validation and optimization of our FOD-based techniques from the denoising of imaging signals to the configuration of compartment models to the selection of tractography parameters. This will create a well-validated system for studying mouse connectome with multi-shell imaging, and provide intuitive guidelines for the design of human studies with FOD-based connectome. There are three specific aims in our project: 1. To develop a general computational framework for the joint estimation of fiber orientation and compartment models from multi-shell diffusion imaging. 2. To validate and optimize the computational tools using multi-shell dMRI data of mouse brains and axonal projection maps from tracer injections. 3. To develop a comprehensive toolkit for fiber bundle reconstruction from multi-shell dMRI data of human brains. In this project we will apply our software tools to analyze data collected in two disease studies. In the first study, we will focus on the cortico-striato- thalamo-cortical (CSTC) network and examine its connectivity changes in the BTBD3 mouse model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In the second study, we will apply our tools to study the relation of retinal impairment and visual pathway integrity via the retinotopy-preserving connectivity between visual areas. All software tools developed in this project will be distributed freely to the research community."

Situated on a campus with all six health professions colleges in proximity to each other, the MCC offers a history of rich transdisciplinary collaboration, an outstanding program of cancer prevention and control that has produced seminal work in Appalachian Kentucky, nationally acclaimed basic research programs in cancer biology and DNA repair and oxidative stress, and a translational therapeutics program complemented by a top five College of Pharmacy.         These strengths have coalesced in MCC's four thematic research programs:  Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Redox Injury and Repair. Currently, the MCC's 108 Research and Associate Research members hold appointments in 24 departments in 7 colleges across the university (25 new faculty were recruited in the last 3 years). MCC members hold grants for 144 research projects funded in the annual composite (direct + indirect) amount of more than $30.5 million, of which over $11.3 million (37%) comes from the NCI. Accrual to therapeutic clinical trials has increased over 130% in three years, and MCC assignable space has increased 40%, including a doubling of state-of-the-art research space. In addition, six shared resources facilitate cutting-edge research by providing a robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced methods. They include:  Biospecimen and Tissue Procurement; Biostatistics; Cancer Research Informatics; Clinical Research and Data Management; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Free Radical Biology in Cancer. The MCC is currently well positioned to take on new challenges and to continue to evolve in key strategic directions that take maximum advantage of these strengths."
"9421244","ABSTRACT: The goal of this proposal is to provide technically-advanced support for the specific aims of NCI- funded projects for medical imaging affiliated with the University of Washington, the NCI Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN), and the NCTN ECOG-ACRIN cooperative group. My medical imaging career began at UW in 1985, where I was fortunate to work with Drs. Michael Graham and Alex Spence, who laid the foundation for quantitative analysis and clinical oncology, respectively. My early work in PET imaging revolved around managing animal imaging projects, a full biochemistry lab and a nascent human PET glioma imaging program. As PET imaging developed under the PET Program Project (P01-CA042045, KA Krohn, PI), we transitioned to human imaging and clinical trials research, probing different biochemical pathways using numerous PET radiotracers. I developed an avidity for compartmental modeling analysis of kinetic image data, initially with guidance from Drs. James Bassingwaithe, Michael Graham and Finbarr O'Sullivan, and later in collaboration with Drs. Tony Shields, David Mankoff, Janet Eary, Hannah Linden and Paul Kinahan, all of them funded by NCI grants. I am currently Director of the Imaging Core lab and a member of Paul Kinahan's U01 grant. I have responsibility for participating in the image analysis working groups of the QIN, extended planning of PET imaging projects, imaging protocols and designing data analysis methods for new experiments. I am a senior contributor to our overall program as well as a provider of novel approaches to data management, quantitative image analysis and data simulations for numerous cancer projects in Radiology and Oncology. Due to the cost of imaging, the radiation dose and other issues, my personal ambition is to extract as much quantitative information as possible from well-designed and executed cancer imaging studies using PET radiotracers and advanced MR methods. My career goal is to provide independent, but collaborative, support for the specific aims of NCI grants for medical imaging projects at with UW, the QIN and ECOG-ACRIN. Additionally, I have national recognition as manager of the ACRIN-UW PET Core Lab, member of the ECOG-ACRIN Head and Neck, Experimental Imaging Sciences and Brain Tumor Committees, and a key member of the NIH-Cancer Imaging Program's QIN Working Groups. The innovative protocols I developed for dynamic imaging are a substantial improvement for extracting quantitative information from dynamic PET, and are now a national clinical trials standard. I routinely present my advanced PET imaging results at national and international scientific meetings (EORTC, SNMMI, WMIC, ACRIN and QIN/NCI) and publish/review manuscripts annually in medical journals. In summary, I have developed a nationally recognized advanced lab for PET image analysis, funded entirely through NCI grants for 30 years. The overall benefit NCI receives for sharing my labor across NCI funded projects will have an impact on current and new investigators, providing them with quantitative methods of analysis for PET/CT and MRI image data using robust, repeatable and validated methods."
"9502205","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transmission of genetic material in each cell division requires its accurate duplication and distribution to the daughter cells. Errors in this process lead to aneuploidy, which is implicated in oncogenesis, birth defects and cell death. The chromosomes are segregated into two equivalent parts by a microtubule- based molecular machine, the mitotic spindle. The spindle is bipolar with each pole carrying an exact complement of chromosomes to each daughter cell. Chromosomes attach to microtubules via multiprotein organelles called kinetochores. The kinetochore is at the center of both an error correction mechanism and the spindle checkpoint, which delays the cell cycle as long as unattached kinetochores remain. Kinetochores attach to microtubules with a striking combination of strength and plasticity. The attachments are mobile and robust under tension, but can also rapidly destabilize in response to regulatory signals. The binding strength of a native kinetochore is greater than that provided by the sum of its components. We will use reconstitution to test hypotheses for how the attachment strength is enhanced. Kinetochores transmit force from the end of the microtubule to the centromere. A model for the connectivity of the complexes within an assembled kinetochore has been proposed based on data gathered from multiple organisms. We propose to test this model and map the chain of connections that transmit force. Finally, we will test hypotheses for how incorrect attachments are detected and corrected."
"9547611","Project Summary: Disability and pain stemming from degenerated intervertebral discs (IVD) affects over 40% of U.S adults and costs >$100 billion annually. The etiology of IVD degeneration (DD) is unknown. There is a significant clinical need for a better mechanistic understanding of DD, and for therapeutic approaches that directly treat the IVD, mitigate DD, and promote recovery of spine function. I nflammation is a key contributor to discogenic pain. High mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1) protein is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that is secreted extracellularly by stressed or dying cells. The biologic function of HMGB1 depends on its cellular location, redox state, and binding partners. Recent studies show that HMGB1 levels increase with DD severity, though the biologic function of HMGB1 in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and its role in DD are largely unknown. The contributions of HMGB1 to NP cell mechanobiology are similarly unknown, and may be dually related to the pro-inflammatory potential of disulfide HMGB1 and to the chemotactic activity of fully reduced HMGB1. The objective of the proposed studies is to identify the redox dependent function of HMGB1 in DD. Our global hypothesis is that HMGB1 will trigger IVD pro-inflammatory signaling, promote ECM degradation and alter NP cell mechanobiology in a redox dependent manner. Aim 1 studies will quantify the biological and mechanotransduction function of redox isoforms of HMGB1 in human NP cells. We will also identify the specific binding receptors that mediate the pro-inflammatory and mechanobiological activity of HMGB1 isoforms in NP cells. Aim 2 studies will identify the contribution of HMGB1 as a central mediating damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in DD inflammation and mechanobiology from acute to chronic stages in vivo. These studies will provide mechanistic evidence about how redox isoforms of HMGB1 contribute to DD and mechanotransduction. Our findings may identify targets for mitigating DD initiation or progression. Since multiple HMGB1 isoforms have the potential to alter the cytoskeleton and thus mechanobiology of NP cells, we predict that our studies will identify strategies for mitigating alterations in IVD mechanotransduction, which are more extensive than regulating inflammatory signaling."

"9459236","PROJECT SUMMARY The most common occupational and environmental hazard in this country is noise. It's not surprising, then, that noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the second most common form of sensorineural hearing deficit, behind only age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Although therapeutics that target the free radical pathway have shown promise for reducing NIHL, there are no effective nutraceuticals or approved medications for NIHL. Development of an efficacious treatment has been hampered by the complex array of cellular and molecular pathways involved in NIHL. Our preliminary studies have shown that the Chinese herb Stephania tetrandra and its main extract, tetrandrine (TET), can effectively protect against NIHL in mice. Clinical use of this herb has exhibited an excellent long-term safety profile. Moreover, TET possesses strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and can also block calcium channels, thus targeting three main signaling pathways that underlie NIHL. Consistent with the funding priorities at National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, in this Phase I application, we will determine the median effective dose (ED50) for this herb extract to prevent (Aim 1) and treat (Aim 2) NIHL in rats using a long noise exposure model (8 hours per day) similar to most industrial working environments. The innovative aspects of our approach are: (1) developing a nutraceutical against NIHL, thus breaking a major access barrier for customers, who are more likely to visit audiologists for hearing treatment; (2) testing in a rat model with cumulative noise exposure similar to that encountered by factory workers; (3) selecting an herb with well-characterized pharmacological properties and a long safety history of clinical applications; and (4) targeting multiple signaling pathways that underlie NIHL. If the outcome of this study is successful, we will then obtain institutional review board (IRB) approval to conduct SBIR Phase II studies in humans of this nutraceutical against NIHL. The goal of our program is to bring this nutraceutical to market for use in the prevention and treatment of NIHL. If this approach is successful, similar nutraceuticals will be evaluated for potential prevention of presbycusis."
"9460216","Summary In addition to secreting soluble mediators, colonic epithelial cells also secrete exosomes (a type of nanovesicle) that contain epigenetic material (proteins, transcription factors, RNAs, miRNAs and DNA fragments). Exosomes are thought to be released basolaterally into the mucosa, where they may regulate local innate responses, and apically, where they may functionally modulate cells at a distance along the gastrointestinal tract and regulate the homeostasis of gut microbiota. In the proposed work, we will exclusively focus on the apical secretion of exosomes into the lumen. Our preliminary results demonstrate that exosomes secreted into the lumen by colonic epithelial cells transit along the gastrointestinal tract and are present in feces. Importantly, colonic and fecal exosomes are similar in their sizes (~140 nm) and miRNA compositions, suggesting that exosomes protect the loaded epigenetic material from highly destructive elements, such as the catabolic enzymes found in the gastrointestinal lumen. Our central hypothesis is that fecal exosomes could yield new miRNA biomarker signatures that may be used to diagnose the degree of colitis and as a drug delivery system to reduce colitis. Our first aim will be to examine the effects of colitis on fecal exosomes, with the aim of identifying new miRNAs that may be used as an intestinal biomarker signature that reflects disease severity. In Aim 2, we will examine whether the microbiota composition can be modulated by the administration of various miRNA panels. In Aim 3, we will examine whether orally administered autologous-healthy fecal exosomes, either alone or as a drug carrier, can reduce intestinal inflammation. It is envisaged that the proposed experiments will facilitate the identification of new biomarkers signatures for intestinal inflammation and allow the development of new therapeutic strategies."
"9422044","Project Summary Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The long-term objective of my research on this award will be to understand the cell-type specificity and molecular mechanisms through which inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor drives the ontogeny of colorectal cancer. APC is mutated in the vast majority of CRC and is broadly considered the initiating event in most of these cancers. Because of this, there has been a large amount of research into the molecular mechanisms through which APC functions. APC is a well-established negative regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and consequently a wealth of evidence exists demonstrating that constitutive Wnt pathway activation downstream of APC loss is necessary for initiation and maintenance of CRC. Recent data however suggests that this body of research has largely overlooked several additional important functions of this tumor suppressor, and that such functions will represent valuable points for preventative action and therapeutic intervention in CRC. Specifically, I have uncovered additional oncogenic pathways activated upon APC loss that are also necessary for initiation and maintenance of CRC. In particular, I recently published data demonstrating that the Msi family of RNA binding proteins are activated upon APC loss in a pathway that appears to lie in parallel to and not downstream of ?-CATENIN. I went on to show that Msi activity is necessary for CRC initiation and maintenance, and that Msi gain of function alone is sufficient to transform the intestinal epithelium in a Wnt-independent manner. At the cellular level, my colleagues and I found that Msi activity acts specifically to drive metabolic activation of quiescent (in G0) intestinal stem cells (ISCs) resulting in cell cycle entry, proliferation, and a block in their differentiation. In contrast, Msi activity has no discernable molecular effect on the active ISC population driven by Wnt pathway activity and previously posited to be the cell-of-origin in CRC. Previous studies have found that these quiescent ISCs are refractory to canonical Wnt pathway stimulation in their dormant state. Therefore, the central hypothesis of my work in the Lengner lab moving forward is that loss of APC can initiate tumorigenesis through promiscuous activation of quiescent intestinal stem cells via Wnt-independent mechanisms. I propose that APC loss initiates a number of oncogenic pathways independent of the canonical Wnt pathway activation (including Msi induction). I will test whether APC loss can initiate CRC by driving quiescent ISCs out of G0 and into the cell cycle, thus establishing quiescent ISCs as a cell-or-origin in colorectal cancer. I will address this hypothesis using a combination of genomic and genetic techniques with the ultimate goal of testing whether Wnt- independent pathways activated downstream of APC loss are viable points for therapeutic intervention in CRC."

However, no entity exists in this setting to integrate these talented investigators and harness the capabilities of this resource-rich environment to promote research and translation of the environmental health sciences. CTEHR will fill this need by serving as the focal point for environmental health research across the TMC and affiliated institutions."
"9404862","RESEARCH PROJECT 2 SUMMARY JULY 2017-JUNE 2023 Men having sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) are the most affected populations by HIV, present high prevalence of KSHV and HPV, and two malignant conditions associated to these virus (Kaposi Sarcoma and Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, respectively) are also disproportionally affecting these groups. KS continues being the most important AIDS associated cancer in LMICs. On the other hand, ART changed the course of HIV and increased life expectancy, but HPV persistence represents a continued risk factor for anal cancer. The aims of this project are 1) to increase the knowledge about prevalence, incidence, and clearance of KSHV and HR-HPV among high risk individuals (MSM and TG individuals with and without HIV) and factors associated to clinical progression 2) to create a repository of prospective and retrospective samples of KS and ASCC cou- pled to clinical data and 3) to explore in KS and ASCC the molecular portrait and viral factors by Whole-Exome sequencing in parallel with RNA-Seq profiling comparing the mutational and gene expression profiles of samples for identify specific transcriptome. We will accomplish these aims studying two populations: a) a cohort of individuals at high risk of developing KS and ASCC 220 MSM and 110 transgender women, HIV positive and HIV negative) in whom we will assess every 6 months during 4 years the prevalence, incidence, and associated factors for KSHV infection and HPV infection. c) a repository of clinical information and biological samples of individual with KS and ASCC. This registry will involve two components, the prospective component that will collect clinical data and samples from patients in study for KS or ASCC (15-30/year) and a retrospective component aimed to provide limited clinical information and remnants of pathological specimens at 6 sites (400 KS and 200 ASCC). All the material will be available also for Basic and Translational Projects 1 and 2. With these aims our research contributes to several areas defined by NIH as high priority research on HIV/AIDS, including the focus in malignances, basic research on genetic determinants of co-morbidities and research to reduce health disparities in the treatment outcomes of people living with HIV. Further, this research will support research capacity development in a low- and middle-income settings. Accordingly, we aim to address several urgent health questions, which will inform the development of a range of policies and interventions throughout South and North America. The long-term objective of this study is to catalyze international collaboration among US and Argentinean investigators to improve capacity to reduce the cancer burden among HIV individuals."
"9404864","The Career Enhancement Core (CE Core) is tailored to develop research capacity in AIDS malignancies by developing the careers of an integrated critical mass of junior researchers in the context of shared resources and scientific networks provided by the consortium institutions. There is a strong rationale for having a well-resourced Career Enhancement Core. Junior Argentinian investigators have major institutional and funding hurdles to overcome, which are complicated by the geographic isolation and the lack of an integrated and interacting critical mass of researchers. CE Core is a career resource, guidance and training hub of the U54 for the junior investigators that provides them with the resources to ready themselves for a competitive independent career in AIDS- malignancies including: critical technical and scientific training, training in essential skills for scientific research, a local and international network of experts for collaboration and networking, training in writing competitive grant applications and access to seed funding to foster new projects. Furthermore, CE Core provides a mechanism to harness the tremendous research strengths at the University of Miami (UM) CFAR and SCCC by promoting new collaborations in new and emerging fields within and outside the network. It is expected that the activities of this core will constitute a living model for excellent and efficient training of junior and mid-career scientists and support the unique type of multidisciplinary training needed for translational research. To ensure the success of young investigators, CE Core has developed a three tiered specific Aims plan: Aim 1: Mentoring Tier: Will support the development of interactive multidisciplinary projects as mentored research opportunities for junior and mid-career scientists supported by Shared cores and a mentoring network within the U54 consortium Aim 2: Training tier: Will identify, coordinate and evaluate career development and training opportunities within and outside the network and its institutions Aim 3: Pilot Program tier: Will create a Pilot program to fully take advantage of the U54 training infrastructure by supporting new ideas within the network, and to incorporate new scientists to the consortium."
"9471674","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Community?academic partnerships are a well-established mechanism for enhancing community health and reducing health disparities. Specifically, community-based participatory research is an assets-based approach where communities, public health practitioners, and academicians work together to identify issues, mobilize resources, and implement solutions to improve health and promote health equity. Importantly, the Institute of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards have emphasized community-based participatory research and equitable community engagement in all phases of research. However, the writing, translation, and dissemination phases of research often do not involve the community. Through this proposal, the Community-Based Public Health Caucus of the American Public Health Association will maximize the resources and convening opportunities afforded by the 2017 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA as a catalyst to train and support the needs of community partners locally, nationally, and globally in effective community-based participatory research dissemination. This conference will provide a platform for community partners, including youth, to build their capacity to engage in the writing and dissemination processes of research. Community organizations and their academic partners will share best practices and protocols they have established for collaborative writing with a national audience. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) host a full day Writing and Dissemination Institute for community members and organizations focused on peer-reviewed publications, social media, and other alternative dissemination methods; 2) maximize the resources and opportunities afforded by the 2017 American Public Health Association Annual Meeting to build the capacity of community?academic partners in community-based participatory research; and 3) establish a peer mentoring/support program by matching community partners who have limited research experience with community partners who are experienced in conducting and disseminating research. This proposal builds on the Community-Based Public Health Caucus? sixteen years of experience mentoring community partners, disseminating results, and building skills in community-based participatory research. The goals of the proposal are to increase community partners? capacity to contribute to manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication, improve community and academic partners? abilities to use social media and technology to communicate effectively with a broader audience, and to increase all partners? appreciation of the role of youth leaders in community-based public health research and dissemination. Ultimately, the proposed activities will help develop the knowledge, skills, peer relationships, and support systems needed by community partners to reduce health disparities in their communities by participating as equal partners in community-based participatory research."
"9346661","PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE ANALYTICAL CORE (CORE 2)  Characterization of natural product (NP) study materials with respect to the chemistry of their phytoconstituents  is fundamental to the mechanistic elucidation of pharmacokinetic natural product-drug interactions (NPDIs).  Unlike drug products, NPs are inherently complex mixtures that vary substantively in bioactive constituent  composition, both between brands and between batches of the same brand. The Analytical Core will develop  a comprehensive strategy to overcome these challenges, building upon a unique and longstanding  collaboration between the Analytical Core Leader Dr. Oberlies (a NP chemist) and the Co-PI Dr. Paine (a  clinical pharmacologist). The responsibilities of the Analytical Core are to 1) characterize the chemistry  components of the 4-6 NPs selected for the Interaction Projects; 2) source, acquire, and analyze the selected  NPs obtained from commercial vendors to assure adequate and quality supply of study materials for the  Interaction Projects; and 3) conduct bioanalysis of NP constituents, drugs, and their relevant metabolites in  pharmacokinetic samples collected from the Interaction Projects. The first responsibility will include an in-  depth literature evaluation, acquiring or isolating de novo the reference standards (depending on commercial  availability), and structurally characterizing the constituents with a suite of spectroscopy and spectrometry  tools. When appropriate, key known in vivo metabolites of the NP constituents (e.g., glucuronides) will be  generated. The reference standards, both individually or as admixtures, will be used for in vitro studies to  generate interaction matrices and will serve as calibration standards for later bioanalysis of NP constituents in  the pharmacokinetic samples. The second responsibility will include establishing specifications for each study  NP based on the characterization data and identifying a suitable commercial manufacturer/vendor who can  supply the required amount of study material meeting the established criteria. Quality of the study materials  will be assured by analyzing of the dosage units for 1) content uniformity of the key constituents, 2) stability of  the key constituents, 3) contaminants, and 4) dosage performance as assessed by dissolution testing.  Commercial products that satisfy strict quality assurance and quality controls will be advanced to the  Interaction Projects. The third responsibility will include quantifying NP constituent, victim drug, and relevant  metabolite concentrations in pharmacokinetic samples obtained from subjects participating in the Interaction  Projects. Dr. Shen and Dr. Paine have extensive experience in the bioanalysis of drugs and metabolites in  biofluids for pharmacokinetic profiling; their laboratories at UW and WSU, respectively, offer a complementary  portfolio of assays, including NP constituents and phenotyping probe drugs, using state-of-the-art LC-MS/MS  instrumentation. The collective NP chemistry and bioanalytical expertise of the Analytical Core investigators  ensures accomplishment of the milestones set forth for this Core, thereby helping to advance the  understanding of NPDIs and their clinical relevance."
"9423409","Project Summary/Abstract Muscle dysfunction from disease, trauma or aging, a major health care burden not adequately alleviated by available therapies, could be greatly reduced by treatments that directly address regeneration pathophysiology by capitalizing on muscle stem cells. Satellite cells comprise a population of progenitor cells that contains muscle stem cells resident within skeletal muscle, and are the primary cellular source for muscle injury repair and homeostatic turnover. Satellite cells are therefore likely focal points of vulnerability in muscle aging and disease states, and in turn are promising therapeutic targets. Methods for isolating and transplanting mouse satellite cells (MuSC) have been well developed, leading to fundamental insights. However, the field of human satellite cell biology has progressed more slowly. The heterogeneous nature of satellite cells in health and disease is poorly understood, and which subpopulations of satellite cells are capable of functions of self- renewal or differentiation is unknown. Recent efforts to extend MuSC biology to human have yielded new approaches to characterize endogenous human satellite cells (HuSC), paving the way for experimental investigations and eventual clinical applications. Deeper knowledge of the heterogeneous nature of human satellite cells, and specifically of the muscle stem cells within the satellite cell pool, is needed to understand how the reserve of stem cells in human muscles changes in aging and disease states, and to develop targeted therapies for muscle disorders. Our long-term objective is to develop regenerative clinical applications using and targeting HuSCs. To better understand the target cell type, this proposal will test the hypothesis that human satellite cells express heterogeneous transcriptional signatures and functions, and that heterogeneity changes during regeneration and aging. Our experiments will use healthy skeletal muscle from adult men and women and are based on preliminary data showing that postnatal human muscle progenitors exist as a distinct pool of satellite cells, which in turn have heterogeneous phenotypes. In Aim 1, we seek to distinguish heterogeneous HuSC populations, and discern relationships of transcriptional identities to regeneration and differentiation properties. Single-cell transcriptome data will be obtained from HuSCs to characterize heterogeneity and heterogeneous subpopulations will be examined in transplantation and regeneration assays in vivo and differentiation assays in vitro. In Aim 2, we will determine how cellular and organismal aging, and activity of aging-related pathways affect HuSC heterogeneity and function. Intrinsic age-related changes in HuSC function will be determined by comparing single-cell transcriptome data and regeneration of HuSCs from young, middle-aged and elderly adults, and by interfering with canonical aging pathways. This innovative combination of in vivo regeneration studies of HuSC with single-cell transcriptomic analysis to investigate endogenous muscle progenitor subpopulations will advance our understanding of endogenous human muscle stem cells, which is essential to develop clinical applications that aim to treat skeletal muscle disorders."
"9444663","PROJECT SUMMARY Dyspnea is one of the most common and distressing symptoms associated with cancer, occurring in nearly 70% of patients with advanced cancer and intrathoracic malignancies. Dyspnea is associated with impaired function, decreased quality of life, and shortened survival. Current therapies for dyspnea, such as supplemental oxygen and opioids, provide limited relief. Although dyspnea is more difficult to treat than pain is, few clinical trials of therapies for dyspnea have been conducted, and such trials are urgently needed to improve quality of life in cancer patients suffering from this condition. The long-term goal of our research is to develop evidence-based palliative therapies for dyspnea in patients with cancer.  Corticosteroids may potentially improve the sensation of dyspnea by modulating the inflammatory response centrally and peripherally and decreasing swelling. On the basis of our preliminary data from a recent clinical trial, we hypothesize that high-dose dexamethasone is effective in treating cancer-related dyspnea. The overall objective of the proposed two-arm, double-blind, parallel (2:1), randomized, controlled trial is to compare the effect of dexamethasone with that of placebo on cancer-related dyspnea. The primary specific aim of this study is to compare the intensity of dyspnea in the dexamethasone arm with that in the placebo arm at week 1. In the second specific aim, we will compare the effects of dexamethasone with those of placebo in terms of personalized dyspnea response (based on a personalized dyspnea goal), unpleasantness of dyspnea, other symptoms, health-related quality of life, respiratory physiologic function, and adverse effects at week 1 and week 2, as well as the intensity of dyspnea at week 2. The third aim is to identify predictive markers of dyspnea response to dexamethasone. After obtaining surrogate consent, we will randomize patients to receive either dexamethasone or placebo twice daily for 2 weeks and monitor the patients closely.  The proposed study is innovative in that it will cover a novel set of indications (i.e., both intensity and unpleasantness of dyspnea), patient population (i.e., patients with cancer), predictive makers (i.e., inflammatory biomarkers, respiratory physiologic function), and patient-reported outcome measures (i.e., personalized dyspnea response, Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events instrument) for dexamethasone. The expected outcome of the proposed study is to establish dexamethasone as a treatment for dyspnea in patients with cancer. These results are expected to have an important positive clinical effect because the effective management of dyspnea will help improve patients' quality of life. This study will also increase our fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of dyspnea, such as how dexamethasone improves inflammation and respiratory physiologic parameters, which may allow us to devise new and more effective, personalized treatments for this distressing symptom, ultimately moving the field of dyspnea research forward and shifting the treatment paradigm."
"9423153","The investigations in this proposal are directed at identifying the mechanism by which hypophosphatemia leads to rickets, and the molecular basis for the therapeutic effectiveness of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) in X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). While the combination of phosphate and 1,25D therapy for XLH has been used for the past 4 decades, the molecular basis for the beneficial effects of 1,25D is not fully understood. We have shown that monotherapy with 1,25D in the Hyp mouse model of XLH improves growth, prevents rickets and improves the microarchitectural and biomechanical properties of bone despite doubling the already increased circulating FGF23 levels. Despite this major increase in FGF23, 1,25D treatment significantly decreases urinary phosphate in Hyp mice. Thus, 1,25D has beneficial effects on bone and renal phosphate handling in XLH, in spite of further increasing FGF23. We propose to examine the effects of 1,25D on FGF23 signaling to identify the mechanism by which 1,25D antagonizes the phosphaturic effects of FGF23. Preliminary data suggest that 1,25D causes retention of Npt2a/NHERF1 at renal brush border membranes of Hyp mice by antagonizing FGF23 signaling downstream of FGF23/FGF receptor interactions. Studies will be performed in kidneys, renal tubular cells and brush border membranes of WT and Hyp mice.  Hypophosphatemia impairs hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis leading to rickets in growing animals and humans, including those with XLH. We have shown that phosphate induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is required for activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in hypertrophic chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo. We have also shown that ablation of A-, B- and C-Raf in chondrocytes abolishes phosphate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, impairs hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis and leads to rickets. Raf;MEK1/2;ERK1/2 can be activated by several pathways. We, therefore, undertook a small molecule inhibitor screen to identify the pathway by which phosphate induces ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These studies demonstrated that VEGFR signaling is required for phosphate induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in primary hypertrophic chondrocytes. The studies proposed will address the hypothesis that phosphate activates VEGFR2 signaling specifically in hypertrophic chondrocytes and will determine whether increased VEGFA release/secretion is required for these effects. They will also address the hypothesis that chondrocyte-specific ablation of VEGFR2 impairs phosphate-mediated hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis in vitro and normal growth plate maturation in vivo. The effects of 1,25D on this signaling pathway will be examined to determine how 1,25D prevents rickets in the setting of hypophosphatemia. Thus, the studies proposed will identify the molecular basis for induction of hypertrophic chondrocyte apoptosis by phosphate and will define how 1,25D modulates this process and impairs the phosphaturic effects of FGF23 in the kidney. Our studies will have important implications for the treatment of XLH patients and will identify the mechanism by which phosphate activates signaling pathways."
"9561258","DIRECTOR'S OVERVIEW AND ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS ABSTRACT The Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Knight Cancer Institute (the Knight) is a matrix cancer center at OHSU in Portland, Oregon. The goal of the Knight is to perform cancer-focused research and to convert these findings into treatments and prevention strategies to improve outcomes for cancer patients. The OHSU Knight Cancer Institute has 139 members who belong to four scientific programs - Cancer Biology, Translational Oncology, Quantitative Oncology, and Cancer Prevention and Control and utilize six well-established shared resources - Flow Cytometry, Proteomics, Advanced Multiscale Microscopy, Integrated Genomics, BioLibrary & Pathology, and Biostatistics. The 139 Knight members are supported by $87.6 million in total extramural funding, $42.9 million of which is from the NCI. In the current funding period, members have published 1,139 cancer focused, peer-reviewed publications, of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 15% inter-programmatic, and 62% externally collaborative. In 2015 a total of 481 patients were enrolled on therapeutic treatment trials, representing over 10% of our new patient population. OHSU is the only academic medical center in Oregon and the Knight Cancer Institute is the only NCI-designated cancer center in the state. The Knight's catchment area is defined as the entire state of Oregon. Our research efforts are targeted to populations and cancers that are unique to our catchment area and includes evaluating populations in our catchment area that are more likely to diagnosed with late-stage cancers. Serving as the advanced oncology care facility for the state, the Knight brings depth and breadth to basic laboratory research; clinical research, including early phase clinical trials; and prevention, control, and population-based research with training programs for cancer researchers and health care professionals. In the current funding period we have recruited 32 new investigators, including four Associate Directors, completely restructured the leadership committees and the programmatic structure of the Knight to facilitate intra- and inter-programmatic interactions and to accelerate progress in achieving our goals. This has led to a significant increase in cancer focus, an increase in NCI funding, and enhanced collaborations as demonstrated by publications and collaborative grants. Given our growth and accomplishments in the current funding period, we request consideration for continued funding and feel we are well positioned for consideration of comprehensive status."
"9431936","Project Summary/Abstract Our overarching goal is to define the molecular mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of mitochondrial disease. Our overall objective in the studies proposed here, which represent the next step in pursuing this goal, is to characterize the pathogenesis of subacute necrotizing encephalopathy and define the role of mTOR in this disease using the Ndufs4(KO) model. Genetic mitochondrial diseases include an array of symptoms, may affect one organ or present as a multisystem disorder, and are remarkably heterogeneous in severity. There are few good models for these diseases and no effective treatment options for mitochondrial disease of any etiology. A clear understanding of the pathogenesis of individual mitochondrial diseases is severely needed; the molecular mechanisms underlying their multiple distinct clinical manifestations are currently unknown. Subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, or Leigh syndrome (LS), is a fatal pediatric mitochondrial disease. Characteristic features of LS include region specific necrotizing lesions of the brain. Though these lesions are the major defining feature of LS, virtually nothing is known of initiating events, what underlies the spatial and temporal specific aspects of the disease, or why some regions of the CNS are inexplicably spared. Our recent work has shown that inhibition of the nutrient sensing signaling complex mTOR attenuates LS in a mouse model, but the mechanisms underlying the benefit are unknown. The goal of this proposal is to define the pathogenesis of LS and the role of mTOR in this disease. We hypothesize that the neurological lesions characteristic of LS result from region and cell-type specific effects of mitochondrial dysfunction, and that mTOR inhibition acts through a discreet downstream neurotoxic pathway. Our experiments will take advantage of the Ndufs4(KO) mouse model of LS, a premier model of human genetic mitochondrial disease which closely resembles human LS. Using this model, we will use characterize the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of neurological lesions in LS by i) identifying the earliest type of cell death and ii) the CNS cell types first lost in lesion formation, iii) defining the region, cell, and cell compartment specificity of phospho-proteome changes during CNS lesion formation, and iv) testing the role of key mTOR regulated pathways in LS using pharmacological approaches. Ultimately, this work will expose basic molecular features of LS and mitochondrial disease in general. In addition, the career development and training components of this proposal will provide key elements for my successful transition to an independent career."
"9237689","Abstract Socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental contributor to health and disease across the life course. Inequalities in health that disfavor sexual and gender minorities have been widely documented in both adolescence and adulthood. Despite the importance of SES to health, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data, as well as study design limitations for data that do exist. In synchrony with the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave V program project design and activity, this proposed ancillary project will collect, clean, disseminate, and analyze new data from a subset of the Add Health cohort (sexual minorities, transgendered individuals, and a comparison sample of heterosexuals) via a theory-guided ancillary survey that will add information about formative experiences more specific to sexual orientation and gender development, and enhance existing prospective information about SES and determinants of SES. Based on Wave IV data we plan to recruit approximately 2,200 self-identified sexual/gender minorities and a random comparison sample of 1,500 heterosexuals. The unique data collected via this project will provide an unprecedented opportunity for new and current Add Health users to prospectively study the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic factors, and health in a population-based sample across the life course at only marginal cost. Positioned within a life course framework and guided by Minority Stress Theory, we will also address three substantive analytical aims using the released ancillary data: 1) to describe the timing and sequence of theoretical milestones in the development of sexual orientation and gender identity; 2) to examine potential mediators (i.e., parent-child relationship quality and subsequent adolescent educational attainment and housing status) of the association between sexual orientation, gender identity, and young adult SES; and 3) to test a hypothesized pathway that economic strain heightens stress, which in turn elevates depressive symptoms. Findings made possible through these new data, in combination with existing longitudinal information about Add Health sample members, have the potential for critical impact on public health policy and intervention strategies to reduce the prevalence of and disparities in disease burden for the sexual and gender minority population."
"9422915","Project summary  The concept that sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) can cause pain and attacks of acute pancreatitis by raising bile and pancreatic duct intraductal pressure is intuitive. Each year in the U.S., thousands of patients are assigned a diagnosis of ?suspected SOD.? SOD has been considered in patients with persistent or recurrent biliary pains after undergoing cholecystectomy, and also in patients with idiopathic acute pancreatitis. The concept that SOD can cause biliary pain in patients without any objective abnormalities (a.k.a., type III SOD) was strongly contested by the EPISOD study, which irrefutably demonstrated comparable outcomes between patients who underwent sphincterotomy or sham ERCP. Following the results of the EPISOD study, the most recent consensus definition for Functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder (Rome IV) still relies heavily on abnormal blood chemistries and post-cholecystectomy bile duct diameter. These are the only ?objective criteria? used to distinguish patients who might still benefit from ERCP. A similar condition, functional pancreatic sphincter of Oddi disorder (FPSD), is considered for patients with idiopathic, recurrent acute pancreatitis.  Given their high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, patients undergoing ERCP for suspected SOD are among the ideal candidates for the ongoing Stent vs. Indomethacin (SVI) trial (U01DK104833). We propose a stringent, longitudinal cohort study that is comprised of patients currently enrolled in or being considered for the parent study because of the high-risk indication of ?suspected SOD.? Unlike SVI, which terminates follow-up 30 days after randomization and ERCP, this ancillary study will follow patients for 12 months after ERCP. At the time of index ERCP, patients will undergo a systematic baseline assessment to objectively quantify their disease burden and measure potential covariates associated with response to ERCP (including pain characteristics, prior surgical history, history of emotional and physical abuse, opiate utilization, quality of life, pain-related disability, expectation of response, among others). All patients will undergo a systematic follow-up assessment at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after their index ERCP. Using a validated tool, Patient Global Impression of Change, the primary outcome is ?improved? or ?much improved? as reported by the patient 12 months after undergoing ERCP. Additional validated instruments will be measured throughout the study period, including those developed for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS?) and a prior study of SOD (Recurrent Abdominal Pain Intensity and Disability (RAPID)."
"9405965","ABSTRACT  Project 2  Too many children fail to achieve proficient reading and writing skills, which has serious public health and economic consequences. This is because reading and writing difficulties are associated with grade retention, referral to special education, dropping out of high school, and entering the juvenile criminal justice system. Moreover, on average, the literacy proficiency of students with learning disabilities is one standard deviation lower than that of typically developing students, and children from low socio-economic backgrounds achieve lower literacy proficiency than their more affluent peers. With funding from NICHD and IES, we have made important strides in improving literacy outcomes for children through the use of dynamic forecasting intervention (DFI) algorithms in Assessment-to-instruction (A2i) technology. A2i is a web-based teaching support technology designed to improve teachers' effectiveness in delivering individualized (or personalized) literacy instruction. However, it is not clear how well the A2i DFI algorithms predict optimal amounts and types of instruction for children whose reading and writing skills fall at the lowest tail of the continuum, and who are least likely to be responsive to general education and intensive interventions. Hence, the overarching aim of the proposed research is to use what we have learned over the past 13 years of developing the DFI algorithms and A2i and conducting randomized controlled trials to test their precision and efficacy; and to address the learning needs of children with the most severe learning disabilities including those with dyslexia and dysgraphia. The project has three specific and interrelated aims. Aim 1 is to determine, using extant assessment and observation data, how predictive current DFI algorithms are for children with severe literacy problems, dyslexia, and dysgraphia; develop expanded algorithms that include child characteristics found to be important for the prediction of response to intervention and additional types of intervention such as assistive technologies; and run simulations of the impact of various algorithms on students' gains during the school year. Aim 2 is to incorporate the expanded DFI algorithms into the A2i technology, which will display recommendations for specific types of instruction/intervention as well as accommodations and assistive technology. Aim 3 is to conduct a prospective study to closely examine the nature and variability of classroom instruction for children with severe literacy disabilities, dyslexia, and dysgraphia. Broadly implemented, these studies have the potential to improve the literacy skills of our most vulnerable children, those with severe learning disabilities, and to improve the quality of their lives academically and beyond."
"9358853","ABSTRACT The 2014 Surgeon General Report (SGR) concluded that there has been an unanticipated increase in lung adenocarcinomas, now the most common type of lung cancer. The SGR identified ventilation in cigarette filters, a design introduced in the 1960s and an important way to lower machine measured cigarette tar yields, as a potential contributor to the increase in these lung cancers. In a recent review, we found highly suggestive evidence that filter ventilated cigarettes was the cause of the increased incidence of adenocarcinoma lung cancer and concluded that there was enough evidence for the FDA to consider regulating filter ventilation, including a ban. Independent of the risk for adenocarcinoma, there would be sufficient justification for regulation based on the impact of ventilation on harmful constituent yields, smoking behavior and smokers' misperception of health risks. However, prior to any regulatory action, the consequences of such a ban needs to be studied. This P01 describes a set of systematic and comprehensive studies that examines the toxicity, appeal and abuse liability of unventilated filters as compared to ventilated filters in the context of a marketplace with and without alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS). Four integrated projects and three cores are proposed and involve a team of multi-disciplinary investigators who have worked together in developing validated models and measures to test tobacco products. The four projects address 1) how unventilated vs. ventilated cigarettes are smoked and the resulting carcinogen exposure levels and potential harm when used with and without ANDS (Project 1); 2) the relative abuse liability of these ventilated vs. unventilated cigarettes and the extent to which ANDS serves as a substitute for unventilated cigarettes (Projects 2 and 3); and 3) the effects of ventilation and product packaging/messaging on consumer perceptions of harm, response and uptake and how these perceptions can be modified by ANDS (Project 4). This research is novel in many ways, including the first to assess the impact of removing filter ventilation and doing this in the context of a complex tobacco marketplace. The projects that we propose are highly integrated. None of these studies alone can address the population impact of a ban on ventilation. It is the combination of these complementary studies that can address the impact of a ban on toxicity, uptake and intensity of product use to determine population health impact. The results of this study would provide critical information to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on whether or not a ban would lead to improved public health."
"9402276","Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) maintain the electrical cadence of neurons and muscle tissues by selectively controlling the rapid inward passage of their namesake ion. The essential NaV complex is comprised of a 260-kDa pore-forming alpha subunit (encoded by NaV1.1-1.9) that is partnered with beta subunits (?1??4). Defects in sodium channel function resulting from inherited mutations or channel dysmodulation are established causes of human disease, and are associated with sudden infant death, arrhythmia and pain-causing syndromes. While there is an urgent need to better understand the molecular basis for perturbed NaV function, there are few research tools available to obtain these insights, and these persistent technical barriers slow the pace of discovery in the study of many types of and membrane proteins. NaVs have begun to benefit from atomic-resolution structures of related bacterial NaVs, but in addition to their evolved differences from eukaryotic channels, these proteins are analyzed in the absence of membrane voltage and thus the relevance of the conformations examined is unclear. For eukaryotic NaVs, key unaddressed issues include structural differences between the resting and inactivated channel states, the mechanism of inactivation and the role of the C-terminus, the impact of inherited mutations on molecular gating events, and the molecular basis of the NaV channel regulation by ?-subunits. We have developed a number of complementary chemical biology research tools that will provide essential new information about the function of NaVs: (a) We have streamlined the used of genetically encoded cross-linking amino acids with novel click- chemistry functionality that, when used in combination with mass spectrometry, enables the discovery of transient inter- and intra-peptide interaction networks in live cells. (b) We have developed a powerful new approach whereby Cy3 and Cy5 are encoded as unnatural amino acids into membrane proteins in live cells. This approach will allow for encoded single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and the direct measurement of electrically silent conformational dynamics of membrane proteins in a live cell under voltage control. (c) An all-atom computational model of the eukaryotic NaV that will guide and support our efforts to determine conformational movement and non-covalent interactions in NaVs. We propose to: (1) advance the mechanistic understanding of sodium channel gating, with a focus on inactivation given its outsized role in human disease, and the conformational differences and energetic coupling between resting and inactivated conformations; (2) obtain an optically generated relative distance map of key gating states of single NaVs and how these distances are effected by disease causing mutations; and (3) provide the basis of ?-subunit regulation, including the molecular identification of interaction sites and mechanisms of disease causing mutations. These three aims are geared towards high impact discovery and are highly relevant to understanding multiple pathologies and the molecular mechanisms of electrical signaling."
"9444129","ProjectSummary:Core5,OpticalInstrumentation  Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. Our projects have been designed to take full advantage of new optics-based technologies developed in the BRAIN Initiative. It is imperative that we continue to innovate and upgrade our instrumentation and methods as the cutting edge of the ??eld moves forward.The Optical Instrumentation Core will develop, implement, and support the optical microscopes and other optics-based instrumentation used in our projects to ensure that they represent the best of the new technologies. To do so, we will leverage the technical and engineering expertise in Princeton?s Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics and recruit additional sta?? devoted to constructing and maintaining our state-of-the-art instruments. Our projects depend on the latest technology for two- and three-photon calcium imaging at cellular resolution, laser-based optogenetic perturbation systems combined with simultaneous imaging, and novel forms of wide??eld microscopy. Some of this instrumentation is based on recent innovations in the labs of our PIs. In other cases, we will collaborate with colleagues at other institutions who have developed innovative new methods. Creating an Optical Instrumentation Core will address the problem that much of the technical work required to innovate and maintain these instruments has shifted to students and postdocs, because it has exceeded the capacity of existing sta??. This division of labor is a problem for four reasons: (1) lab personnel often do not have su??cient time or expertise to produce the best possible results, (2) the di??usion of responsibility leads people to duplicate one another?s e??orts, (3) researchers spend their time on technical work at the expense of doing science, and (4) expertise can be lost as students and postdocs move on. For all these reasons, we propose to standardize this function across projects to improve quality control and e??ciency. Centralizing the design, construction, maintenance, and support of these instruments will increase the e??ciency and rigor of our microscopy experiments, while freeing lab personnel to focus on designing experiments and collecting data."
"9397205","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The health community in recent years has witnessed the digitization of medical records proceed at an astonishing pace. Longitudinal databases offer the promise for health informatics researchers to conduct observational research at massive scales. This project?s goal is to contribute to the statistical and computational advances that will make such a promise a reality. Our three aims highlight clinical research scenarios for which current analytic procedures are inadequate in the setting of large-scale observational data; we then propose novel methods to address these shortcomings. In Specific Aim 1, we will conduct a rigorous analysis of propensity score estimation tools for bias reduction in drug effect estimates in high dimensional settings. We develop an improved simulation framework and conduct negative control experiments to assess the performance of LASSO penalty regularization and the high dimensional propensity score (hdPS) algorithm. In Specific Aim 2, we will establish the viability of conditional logistic regression (CLR) for conducting large scale observational cohort studies. CLR, which has demonstrated bias reduction benefits over unconditional logistic regression for case-control studies, has not been evaluated for cohort studies because of its computational burden. We propose the combination of a dynamic programming algorithm and Maximization- Minimization (MM) algorithms to greatly optimize the evaluation of CLR. In Specific Aim 3, we challenge the one-drug/one-outcome study paradigm dominant in drug safety surveillance research by developing computational tools that will allow for the analysis of thousands of drug-outcome pairs. We leverage MM algorithms on observational study designs such as logistic regression and the self-controlled case series to open up their statistical computation to massive parallelization opportunities with graphics processing units (GPUs). For each specific aim, we conduct evaluation studies in pressing clinical scenarios; for instance, we study the relative risks of anticoagulation medications on serious complications such as stroke and major bleeding. The anticipated impact from the successful completion of these aims include greater clarity in the selection of propensity score models, the viability of using conditional logistic regression to conduct cohort studies, and substantial improvement in the statistical computation for conducting standardized drug safety studies that analyze thousands of drug-outcome pairs."
"9359224","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Neuroblastoma (NB) represents a prototypical pediatric cancer genetically, in that point mutations are rare, but  amplifications and segmental chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) occur commonly. Notably,  amplification of the MYCN oncogene and loss of chromosome 1p are both prominently associated with high-  risk disease. While these events commonly co-occur, their interdependence is poorly understood. We  hypothesize that both loss of chromosome 1p and amplification of MYCN create unique vulnerabilities  to therapy, including immunotherapy. MYCN amplification can be accurately modeled in immune-intact  genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM), but chromosome deletions have been challenging to model.  Using normal human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated  isogenic in-vivo NB models driven by MYCN, observing increased penetrance in tumors carrying both MYCN  and engineered deletions in chromosome 1p. We thus have modeled MYCN-driven NB in the presence or  absence of 1p deletions, enabling us to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities associated with 1p loss. MYCN  broadly impacts the tumor immune response through regulation of checkpoint proteins such as PD-L1. We  have tested an array of targeted and conventional therapies for the treatment of NB, many directed against  MYCN, but the effects of these on the immune system are poorly understood. With recent FDA approval of  dinutuximab monoclonal antibody directed against the surface marker GD2, targeted immunotherapy is now  standard-of-care for NB. Using a MYCN driven mouse model developed in the PI's lab, we will characterize NB  tumors with CyTOF mass cytometric single cell proteomics to measure markers of immune cells, tumor cells,  and signaling in both tumor and host cells simultaneously to identify and characterize small molecule inhibitors  that cooperate with immunotherapy in the treatment of neuroblastoma.  A1: Utilize human stem-cell based in-vivo models of neuroblastoma to identify therapeutic  vulnerabilities associated with chromosome 1p deletion  A2: Leverage MYCN-driven immunocompetent models of NB to identify effective combination therapy,  focusing on immunotherapy.  Successful completion of Aim 1 identifies therapeutic vulnerabilities in high-risk NB driven by both MYCN  amplification and 1p deletion. Successful completion of Aim 2 identifies targeted therapies that cooperate with  immunotherapy in the treatment of MYCN-driven NB. Both aims propose characterizing existing mouse models  of NB to leverage opportunities in precision medicine (immunotherapy and 1p-directed therapies). This  characterization provides targets, biomarkers, and actionable therapies for clinical trials in children with NB."
"9369483","Project Summary PET and MRI offer complementary views of physiology and the ability to measure data from both modalities concurrently provides a unique opportunity to study biological mechanisms in ways that were heretofore impossible to realize in intact animals, including human subjects. However, this advance in hardware and data acquisition poses new challenges for data analysis and interpretation due to the fact that the modalities are based upon different physical principles and generally reflect different in vivo phenomena. Conceptually, we address the problem and seize the opportunity via integrated PET/MR analysis frameworks wherein shared physiological mechanisms mathematically link quantitative PET and MR models, improving the accuracy and precision of physiological measurements and, in several instances, permitting outcomes not achievable using either modality alone. This general approach is proposed for development in several specific and illustrative cases ? neurotransmission, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxidative stress ? that together span diverse organ systems, physiological processes, and potential disease applications."
"9519322","SUMMARY RNA functions as the central conduit of information exchange in all cells, a role encapsulated in two critical observations. First, a large fraction of emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses including Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, and Dengue. Second, a much larger fraction of the mammalian genome is transcribed into diverse kinds of non-coding RNAs (~70%) than is translated into protein (1- 2%). The functions of messenger, non-coding, and viral RNAs are governed by the linear sequence, base-paired secondary structure, higher-order tertiary structure, and quaternary interactions involving proteins and small molecules. Overall, our understanding of the number and complexity of RNA structures and how RNA structure drives diverse biological functions is very limited. Most methods developed to date for analyzing RNA structure in high-throughput ways do not measure structure in a definitive and accurate way, making it difficult to define broad principles for interrelationships between RNA structure and function. We seek to understand the fundamental roles of RNA structure in all areas of biology by pursuing a two-pronged approach involving (1) inventing, developing, and rigorously validating highly accurate chemistry-based technologies for discovery of novel RNA structures and the networks of interactions between RNAs and proteins and then (2) applying these technologies to problems of broad importance. Here we propose to interrogate the structures and interaction partners of the pathogenic Dengue RNA virus and the Xist long non-coding RNA. Throughout this work, we will focus on in-cell analysis of native viral and endogenous RNAs. This work is expected to have long-term impact for three broad reasons. First, RNA elements with higher-order folds and extensive protein networks are likely to be harbingers of function. Second, there are likely to be structural folds that are different from the relatively limited classes of structures that have been analyzed to date. Third, RNA elements with higher-order folds also contain clefts and crevices that are ideal targets for small- molecule ligands ? and novel drugs ? that modulate biological function by targeting RNA."
"9344916","Project Summary The high failure rate of drugs late in clinical development is an indication that nonclinical in vitro models and animal models are not accurately predicting compound performance in humans. Only 1 out of 10,000 molecules identified by pharmaceutical companies as a potential drug candidate is successfully advanced through FDA approval. Drug toxicity in general and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in particular, represent the major cause of drug attrition or removal from the marketplace. There is a critical gap between the need for predictive in vitro platforms to evaluate the effects of compounds on human health and the availability of solutions which meet the throughput and accuracy required. To meet this need for increased biological relevance, the next generation of toxicity testing is beginning to incorporate fluidics and more complex cellular models into in vitro compound safety and efficacy testing. Non-fluidic (static) tissue culture plates have been a staple of the in vitro pharmaceutical testing market for decades and are the major model system used for liver safety testing. However, static cell culture systems fail to generate biologically relevant gradient drug exposures and may lack the viability and metabolic competency essential for safety testing. Additionally, these static systems do not allow for discrimination between primary drug effects and those mediated by metabolic breakdown products or cellular responses. While these static systems afford a picture of the acute toxicity of the compound itself, this picture is incomplete, at best, and potentially leads to the progression of compounds with serious safety issues into animal studies and clinical trials. These late stage failures come at huge financial costs to pharmaceutical companies, creating a significant need in the marketplace We have developed the SciFlowTM 1000 Fluidic Culture System to address existing shortcomings in drug safety testing. SciFlow 1000 is an innovative, gravity driven, fluidic tissue culture system providing highly biologically relevant compound exposures, and an innate ability to distinguish between parent drug and metabolite effects. The SciFlow System is based on a standard, SBS compliant, 96-well plate format with the addition of fluidic pathways connecting the wells along each row of the plate. This enables the evaluation of gradient compound concentrations on cells, under dynamic one way fluidic conditions that are more representative of the in vivo environment. SciFlow is designed as an open platform, supporting the culture of many cell types, in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) formats, and in a more biologically relevant fashion. To validate its diverse culture capabilities, SciFlow?s compartments have been populated with cells representing a wide variety of phenotypes including primary liver cells (hepatocytes: human, dog, rat, mouse, etc.) and many diverse cell lines (HepG2, HepaRG, Caco2, etc.). Preliminary compound toxicity studies have been completed, utilizing many biochemical and high content imaging assays to assess cellular outcomes. This proposal describes the development of an SOP to leverage the benefits of the SciFlow 1000 to provide improved drug-induced liver injury prediction. The aims of this project are to:  1) Optimize existing exposure and assay protocols in the SciFlow 1000.  2) Use optimized assays to test a library of 21 compounds of known and varying DILI on 3 liver cell models  (primary human hepatocytes, co-cultures of primary human hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, and  HepaRG cells). Utilize that dataset to drive selection of a panel assays to include in a final SciFlow DILI  predictive SOP.  3) Demonstrate the capabilities of the SciFlow DILI predictive SOP in two blinded studies. This work will be completed in collaboration with the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy Institute for Drug Safety Sciences. The outcomes of this study will be a complete solution for conducting predictive toxicology analyses on new drug candidates with previously unattainable levels of sensitivity and specificity. These accurate in vitro to in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE) will decrease the number of compounds with serious toxicity liabilities proceeding into the later pre-clinical and early clinical drug development, saving pharmaceutical companies both time and money while enabling the ultimate goal of more rapidly providing safe and effective therapeutics."
"9562442","The proposed Flint Center for Health Equity Solutions will establish an NIMHD Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for health disparities research on chronic disease prevention to be based in Flint, Michigan. This proposal was developed in collaboration with community members from its inception, and evolved from a conversation between Flint community members and the Flint-based Michigan State University researchers that they helped to hire. The TCC will strengthen community-engaged health disparities research in the Flint area, serving as regional focal point for organizing and nurturing productive working relationships with across a broad cross-section of stakeholders with an interest in eliminating health disparities. The TCC has 4 cores and 2 intervention research projects. Research Project 1 will examine the effectiveness of a community-designed, community-based, multilevel physical activity and healthy food intervention (the Church Challenge) relative to enhanced treatment as usual in primarily African-American Flint-area churches. The intervention targets individual, church, and church as driver of community policy-level changes (e.g., improving healthy food and physical activity opportunities in Flint). Research Project 2 will evaluate a multi-tiered intervention program for men and women in recovery from substance abuse. Tier 1 consists of a peer coaching and advocacy recovery support service. Tier 2 is an evidence-based Strengthening Families Program to support family reunification and support. Each of the proposed projects represent an area of unmet need to address health inequities, including access via affordable health care; structural inequality and social isolation and stratification. Each project has high potential for translation. The TCC's Administrative Core will provide leadership for the Center's overall strategic planning, including scientific leadership and oversight. This Core will manage, coordinate and supervise the entire range of proposed TCC activities, monitor progress and ensure that component plans are carried out. The Consortium Core will organize and nurture productive working relationships with a broad cross-section of academic partners, community organizations, minority and health disparity populations, health care provider organizations, for-profit or non-profit organizations and foundations, governmental agencies, and other stakeholders to advance TCC-related health equity efforts. The Methodology Core will conduct a community needs assessment and provide the TCC with statistical, mapping, and cost-effectiveness analysis services. The Dissemination and Implementation Science Core will develop and manage a highly effective translation program (i.e., conduct research dissemination) and also produce generalizable knowledge about how best to do so (i.e., conduct dissemination and implementation research that is synergistic with other Center efforts). Our initiatives will reduce health inequities in Flint, Michigan and provide promising insights to promote translational approaches in Region 5 and more broadly across the nation."
"9444306","Project 2: The Neural Basis of Motor Pattern Loops Abstract The goal of Project 2 is to understand how motor pattern loops link high-level behavioral goals with low-level control of muscles. In the fly, such motor pattern loops are comprised of populations of descending neurons (DNs), which integrate dendritic signals in the central brain and project their axons to the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We will take advantage of cell-type specific Split-Gal4 lines to record and manipulate activity in DNs that target VNC circuits that control the fly legs and wings. We will combine optogenetic manipulation of DNs with fine-scale analysis of walking and flight behavior, and measure intracellular DN signals in behaving animals with whole whole-cell electrophysiology recordings. These efforts are divided into the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine how wing muscle action groups are recruited into functional actions by descending control. Specific Aim 2: Determine how leg muscle action groups are recruited into functional actions by descending control. Specific Aim 3: Characterize the activity patterns of identified descending neurons in behaving flies using in vivo whole-cell recordings."
"9479910","Project 2 Molecular signatures for ME/CFS sub-types Abstract We propose the most comprehensive project to date to understand the metabolic and transcriptional perturbations that occur in ME/CFS. The investigators have extensive expertise in metabolomics and functional genomics, and access to banked samples from well-characterized cohorts of ME/CFS and control individuals. We will also have access, through Project 3, to samples obtained before and after orthostatic challenge and exercise. There are some intriguing indications from prior, limited studies that suggest that both metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches could yield insights into this poorly understood disorder. Transcriptional studies in ME/CFS performed on circulating leukocytes have indicated a combination of immune cell dysfunction and altered metabolic properties, but have generally been performed on limited numbers of individuals using less advanced transcriptional profiling than we propose in the current project. Published metabolomic studies in ME/CFS have consistently revealed evidence for abnormalities, with evidence for disturbances in lipid metabolism and neurotransmitter-related pathways in particular. Project Co-Lead Fiehn has generated preliminary data for 50 ME/CFS cases and 50 controls, showing results that support lipid and neurotransmitter metabolism abnormalities, in particular involving complex lipids and tryptophan metabolites. Co-Lead Greally?s group will study the same patients as Fiehn, following up on prior published studies with a focus on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptional patterns. The Greally group has developed an approach that uses single cell transcriptomic reference data in combination with a published analytical algorithm to measure the proportions of cell subtypes in PBMCs from RNA-seq data. This allows a gene expression change in PBMCs to be attributed to either a change in cell subtype proportion, or to a genuine alteration in expression of a gene. This allows, for the first time, two distinct but individually interesting biological events to be distinguished ? the cell subtype and transcriptional alterations associated with ME/CFS. Our analytical focus is on the integration of the metabolomic and the transcriptomic information in Project 2, but we will also explore the associations with the clinical and laboratory data generated in the other projects, allowing us to link with microbiome and clinical variability. We note that the epigenetics field has recently begun to link both high body mass index and hyperlipidemia with changes in DNA methylation of peripheral blood leukocytes, with the DNA methylation found to be induced by both obesity and high lipid levels. This represented an unexpected reverse causation outcome that links metabolomic and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and serves as a foundation for the linked studies of this Project. Our two groups have extensive expertise in metabolomic and functional genomic research, which we will now be focusing on this extremely difficult disorder, but with early results yielding insights that indicate the promise of these molecular approaches in understanding and finding interventions to treat individuals with ME/CFS."
"9560994","Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center  Tissue Management Shared Resource (Translational Research Resource)  Project Summary/Abstract  The Tissue Management Shared Resource was established in 2004 to provide IRB-approved centralized  tissue procurement services for specimens derived from consented human participants. Over 22,000 tissue  specimens and bodily fluids, from over 50 different tissue types including breast, lung, prostate, kidney,  bladder, colon, pancreas, blood, pleural fluid, urine and bone marrow have been collected since its  establishment. In terms of demographics, specimens were obtained from Caucasian (72%), African-American  (24%) and Hispanic participants (16%). Of the tissues collected, 56% of specimens are derived from female  participants. Although the basic functions and goals of the Tissue Management Shared Resource remain  essentially unchanged, the capabilities of the facility have been significantly expanded to support the growing  needs of Simmons Cancer Center members and facilitate translational research activities. To facilitate this  growth, Tissue Management Shared Resource has moved to a new location that provides additional space for  equipment and staff. The equipment has been updated to accommodate increased and changing research  needs. Additionally, tissue banking and annotation of specimens has been extensively expanded. Specimen  related data are captured and stored in our tissue management database, caTissue Plus, and are correlated  with clinical information through the Simmons Cancer Center's clinical research data warehouse (i2b2) as part  of the UTSW Center for Translational Medicine (CTM), which is the institutional CTSA (Clinical & Translational  Science Award). This tool links caTissue Plus data with EPIC Clarity (the electronic medical record), Oncolog  (the university tumor registry database), CoPath (the anatomical pathology database), CancerGeneConnect  (the familial genetics database) and other disease-specific databases. Due to this robust infrastructure,  biospecimens are automatically annotated with demographic, pathological, and clinical data so that interested  investigators can perform basic sample availability queries of this database in a de-identified manner through a  secure web interface."
"9427922","Project Summary/Abstract While many immigrants arrive in the US with good health status, there are persistent disparities in access to health care for immigrant groups that may contribute to their more than expected health declines over time, particularly among the nation's two largest immigrant populations, Latinos and Asians. Since the late 1990s there has also been a proliferation of public policies at the state level that have an impact on immigrant populations. There is growing evidence that immigrant policies are a structural factor associated with disparities in Latino and Asian immigrant health care access. Yet, there is limited understanding of the processes by which policy, a contextual factor, has an impact on individual-level health care access outcomes. This study aims to examine the pathways between state policy and access to care by (1) identifying and assessing the variation among Latino and Asian immigrants' experiences of exclusion related to immigrant policies, (2) understanding the extent to which experiences of policy-related exclusion are associated with barriers to health care, and (3) assessing the extent to which those associations are modified by citizenship status, race/ethnicity, and knowledge of policies. We will conduct a mixed-methods study of the experiences of exclusion among Latino and Asian immigrants in California, a demographically diverse state with a range of state-level immigrant policies. We will assess the association between access to health care and experiences of exclusion across five sectors: health care, social services, education, employment, and law enforcement. We will analyze data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a representative population survey of state residents, combined with a follow-up survey of 2,000 CHIS immigrant respondents that collects additional information on experiences related to immigrant policies. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews of immigrants in two regions to identify the nuances of their experiences of and responses to those policies. The findings from this research can both identify policies outside the health sector that have impacts on immigrant access to health care, and suggest educational interventions which could improve immigrant knowledge in ways that improves their access to needed health care."
"9383890","Abstract In the U.S., Latina women report higher rates of inactivity than their non-Hispanic White and male counterparts, and are disproportionately affected by related health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes). To address this public health crisis, evidence-based interventions that utilize state-of-the-art technology, theory and methods are needed to increase physical activity (PA) among this high-risk population. Recently, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (N=205) to test the efficacy of a 6-month culturally adapted, individually tailored, Spanish-language Internet-based PA intervention among Latinas (Pasos Hacia La Salud, R01CA159954) vs. a Wellness Contact Control Internet Group. Increases in minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were significantly greater in the Intervention Group compared to the Control Group at 6 and 12 months (p < .01) but still did not reach levels recommended in the national physical activity guidelines. As improvements in PA in the Intervention Group were significantly associated with website use and increases in self-efficacy, enjoyment, and social support in the parent study, we used these data to inform technology and theory-supported enhancements to the intervention (i.e., text messaging and adaptive goal setting to increase website use and further targeting of the previously mentioned key psychosocial constructs) to achieve even greater increases in PA, and maintain these gains over the long term (24 months) in the renewal of R01CA159954. For the proposed study, 300 Latina women will be randomized to either 1) the original Pasos Hacia La Salud tailored Internet-based PA intervention (Original Intervention) or 2) the data driven, enhanced version of the Pasos Hacia La Salud PA intervention (Enhanced Intervention). We hypothesize that participants in the Enhanced Intervention arm will report significantly more minutes/week of MVPA than participants in the Original Intervention arm at 6 months. We will also examine the maintenance of treatment effects at 12, 18, and 24 months, as well as the costs of delivering the Enhanced vs. Original Intervention programs, and the potential mediators of the intervention-PA relationship. The proposed high- reach, low-cost intervention holds great promise in promoting and maintaining the positive health benefits of PA in the lives of Latina women in the United States."
"9444238","Project 1 - A comprehensive atlas of the larval zebrafish brain - Abstract Anatomical information about the brain, such as the identity of brain regions, the molecular and morphological makeup of individual neurons and their connectivity arrangements, are all critical information for formulating hypotheses of neural circuit function. While much anatomical data concerning the zebrafish brain are being generated by the community, the field lacks a central repository which is capable of ingesting, integrating and quantitatively describing these data. To meet this need, we propose to generate a multilayered, multimodal, and multiscale atlas of the larval zebrafish brain. This project will provide the necessary infrastructure to import data from all the team members as well as the international community, integrate these data into a common reference brain, and make it publicly available and easily accessible online. This Atlas will exist at 3 levels of resolution: 1) The macro-scale, where we will define and describe the known anatomical regions of the brain, and provide new tools for regional annotation and 3D visualization. 2) The micro-scale will aggregate diverse datasets describing individual neurons in the brain. These will include: molecular makeup (through transgenic and antigenic stains - neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, neuromodulator, gene expression, etc), functional properties (through calcium and perhaps voltage imaging), morphology (through single cell imaging/tracing, and EM reconstructions) and connectivity (through functional connectivity, viral tracing, patch clamp recordings and nano-scale EM data). Finally, 3) The nano-scale, which will aggregate whole-brain serial EM volumes from multiple individual larvae. It will provide the infrastructure for collaborative nano-scale annotations, such as identified synaptic connections and high-resolution morphology. Collectively, this Atlas will be a foundational resource for zebrafish neuroscientists, and will be an invaluable tool for creating and constraining biologically plausible neural circuit models, including the Multiscale Virtual Fish."
"9386347","PROJECT SUMMARY SickleGenAfrica is a genomics network that aims to test the overarching hypothesis that genetic variation in cyto-protective defenses against hemolysis influences the risk of organ damage in sickle cell disease (SCD). The focus of project 2 is to determine Genome-wide determinants of the risks of malaria complications in SCD. Background of the project: Malaria in SCD is associated with severe complications and an increased risk in mortality. Hemolysis is a key process that contributes to the pathogenetic processes in both malaria and SCD particularly with respect to acute and chronic end-organ damage leading to severe anemia, lung and brain injury. 4 countries in SickleGenAfrica (Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria and Cameroon) and US collaborators (Pittsburgh and Morehouse) have experience and expertise in both conditions and intend to use established resources to interrogate the two conditions as well as establish a murine model to evaluate malaria in SCD. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the phenotype of severe malaria in SCD patients, and determine the relationship between variations in HCP genes and malaria disease phenotype/severity. (2) To investigate the inflammatory response (cytokines/chemokines and adhesion molecules) in SCD patients with malaria, and examine the relationship with HCP levels and risk of severe malaria. (3) Functionally validate association between HCPs and severity of malaria in transgenic SCD mice. The significance of the proposed research and relevance to public health: SCD and malaria are both disorder of public health significance (annual SCD births of 300,000 globally; 3.3 billion people living in 106 countries are at risk of malaria infection) with high mortality (Up to 90% childhood mortality in SCD; 438 000 malaria deaths). Accurate description of disease expression and the identification of genetic and environmental modifiers of disease will improve the diagnosis, management and prevention of malaria-related morbidity and mortality in SCD. The unique features and innovation of the project: (1) The first study with the largest SCD population (n=7,000) investigated for malaria. (2) Assessment of phenotypic description of malaria in SCD during acute and steady-state. (3) Evaluation of inflammatory response in malaria in SCD (4) Use of murine model to investigate malaria in SCD. The methodology to be used: We will enrol 7,000 SCD patients in 4 countries at clinic and evaluate patients during hospitalization. We will infect transgenic SCD and control mice with Plasmodium and measure levels of hemolysis cytoprotective proteins and inflammatory markers and evaluate disease expression focusing on hemolysis and anemia as well as end-organ damage to lung and brain. Expected results and description of how your results will affect other research areas: Description of phenotypic expression of co-morbidity of malaria and SCD, with identification of genetic and environmental modifiers of disease, emphasizing the role of hemolysis in both conditions."
"9422349","Project Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Despite decades of clinical, neuropathological and neurobiological research the molecular substrates and causal biological substrates of AD remain elusive. Most studies have focused on vulnerable brain regions defined by neuroimaging or neuropathological findings. However, our recent unbiased study of transcriptomic networks in 19 brain regions identified the parahippocampal gyrus as the brain region with the greatest transcriptomic changes associated with disease development and progression irrespective of whether disease development and progression were defined using functional measures of cognition or the canonical neuropathological lesions of AD (Wang MH et al, Genome Medicine 8:104). These observations have been reinforced further by our larger scale multi-Omics data from over 200 donors and 4 brain regions, for which we have generated whole exome, whole genome and RNA sequencing data through the current AMP-AD Consortium. These studies, and most others published to date, have not examined transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic changes in the same tissues and donors and by utilizing whole tissue homogenates have been unable to identify vulnerabilities holistically and with cell-type-specific fidelity. Here we propose to generate additional, matched large-scale proteomic and epigenetic data as well as cell type specific transcriptomic and epigenomic data from the parahippocampal gyrus and develop novel network inference and analysis approaches to integrate all these multi-Omics data as well as cognitive, pathological and physiological data to construct high-resolution, multiscale molecular networks in the parahippocampal gyrus in AD. To overcome some of the drawbacks of postmortem studies and to gain insight into causal mechanisms and networks we will experimentally validate networks identified in postmortem tissue by perturbing a number of key drivers in AD transgenic mouse primary brain cells and human iPSC derived brain cell cultures to determine the mechanisms underlying vulnerability of the parahippocampal gyrus. We expect that our data-driven and hypothesis-free multiscale network modeling of parahippocampal vulnerability in AD will have a large impact on the AD field and lead towards a more comprehensive and precise understanding of AD pathogenesis. More importantly, the proposed research will pave a path towards drug discovery for AD targeted at specific vulnerabilities in specific brain cell types."

"9320492","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholism is a chronic, progressive disorder often characterized by patterns of binge drinking that lead to detrimental health consequences and a great economic burden on society. Alcohol is known to produce subjective effects (i.e. feelings of intoxication) that have been associated with the perpetuation of binge drinking, suggesting that these subjective effects contribute to alcohol's abuse potential. Drug discrimination is a reliable in vivo pharmacological assay that can be used to characterize the receptor basis of alcohol's subjective effects, as measured through a behavioral output. Previous work using this technique has established that alcohol (or ethanol) is a stimulus complex made up of concurrent activity at multiple receptor systems in rodents and primates. Specifically, alcohol acts as a positive modulator at the GABAA receptor and an antagonist at the NMDA receptor, leading to an overall dampening of neuronal activity. While a great deal of research has been dedicated to alcohol's receptor basis in the brain, very little is known about the circuitry that underlies ethanol's subjective effects. Importantly, there are no published studies to date that have directly examined brain circuitry that mediates ethanol subjective effects in monkeys. Mapping circuitry that mediates the subjective effects of ethanol in the primate brain will help bridge our  understanding of brain mechanisms mediating alcohol intoxication from rodents to primates and improve targeting strategies for potential pharmacotherapies. There is converging evidence from both rodents and humans suggesting that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is involved in subjective alcohol intoxication, and that these effects are composed of both GABAergic and NMDA glutamatergic mechanisms. Thus, as a first step in mapping the circuitry related to the stimulus effects of ethanol intoxication, the current proposal utilizes a chemogenetic strategy to directly manipulate neural activity within the NAc core. Further, this study proposes to use drug discrimination to characterize the pharmacological basis of NAc core involvement in ethanol's subjective effects, providing a novel investigation of the intersection between circuitry and pharmacology. Overall, the goal of these studies is to better understand the basis of alcohol intoxication in the primate brain, which will improve targeted treatment strategies for alcohol use  disorders."
"9553115","Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent blood cancer affecting approximately 83,367 Americans. In 2014, it is estimated that there will be 24,050 new cases of MM and 11,090 people will die of this disease. High dose chemotherapy in combination with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the standard treatment for MM; however, innovative strategies are required to improve treatment outcome as most patients fail to achieve complete remission post-transplant and 55.1% of patients die within 5 years. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a potentially fatal complication in patients receiving HSCT, but recent evidence suggests that, when properly treated, it can exert beneficial clinical outcomes. CMV reactivation is associated with a markedly reduced risk of relapse in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with allogeneic HSCT and while the mechanism is unknown, CMV-mediated alterations in the composition of NK-cell subsets are likely involved. NK-cells also play a critical role in slowing the progression of MM and adoptive transfer of NK-cells has been used as a means of curtailing the growth of MM in humans. One possible mechanism underpinning the beneficial effect of CMV on clinical outcome in AML patients, which might be beneficial in MM patients as well, is the increased frequency of NKG2Cpos/NKG2Aneg NK-cells with CMV. NKG2C is an activating receptor and NKG2A an inhibitory receptor for the non-classical HLA class I molecule HLA-E. Thus, only NKG2Cpos/NKG2Aneg NK-cells are able to effectively kill HLA-Epos target cells. Interestingly, both AML and MM cells highly express HLA-E, which protects them from them patient NK-cells that are mostly NKG2Apos. As a result of the limited ability of patient NK-cells to target their own MM cells, immunotherapeutic procedures that rely on donor NK-cells have been developed. The infusion of allogeneic NK-cells has shown promise as a means of inducing remission in MM patients; however, efficacy is limited by the difficulty of acquiring adequate numbers of alloreactive NK-cells and high expression of NKG2A relative to NKG2C in expanded NK-cells. Thus, new protocols are needed to enhance the anti-MM activity of NK-cells. Our group has shown that latent CMV infection enhances NK-cell activity against HLA-E expressing tumor cell lines (including the MM cell line U266) through an NKG2C-dependent mechanism. In this study, we propose to extend these findings and examine the role of CMV infection and frequency of NKG2Cpos/NKG2Aneg NK-cells on early post-transplant responses in MM patients receiving autologous HSCT. We also intend to show that NKG2Cpos/NKG2Aneg NK-cells with high anti-MM activity can be preferentially expanded from fresh PBMCs and cryopreserved cord blood samples using HLA-E-transfected feeder cells. If successful, our innovative approach could improve NK-cell-based immunotherapy for the treatment of MM."
"9561226","Project Summary/Abstract: Transgenic & Genetic Constructs (TGC)  The Transgenic & Genetic Constructs (TGC) Shared Resource, directed by Dr. Steven Fiering, provides services  for generating, maintaining, and genetically and experimentally manipulating genetically modified mice (GMM).  TGC provides mouse, cell, and genetic construct manipulation and speed congenics to NCCC researchers.  These technical services are provided by 3 technical specialists, one for the mouse work, one in Embryonic  Stem cell culture and general molecular biology research, and the third performing automated SNP genotyping  assays using Illumina(R) technology. Newer services of TGC involve using techniques to generate mice with  either humanized immune systems or humanized livers. A colony of immunodeficient Nod/SCID/IL2gamma  receptor knockout mice (NSG) is in high demand by NCCC researchers, because they are the optimal strain for  establishing xenografts of human tumor cell lines. For many GMM-based experiments, knowing the genetic  background carrying the genetic modifications is crucial. Traditionally, a 3-year process of random backcrossing  has been required to change the genetic background of a GMM. Dr. James Gorham, with assistance from  Fiering, established a speed congenic facility that uses automated SNP genotyping to perform speed congenic  and related services on GMM. Merging TGC with the Speed Congenics Resource expanded TGC services to  provide rapid identification of male breeders with the highest proportion of the desired background; this has cut  the required number of backcross generations from 10 to 5. On a daily basis, Fiering focuses primarily on the  transgenic mouse generation and utilization services, and Gorham focuses on the speed congenics, but they  work together to direct TGC as one unit. Combining these services into TGC has enabled us to expand and  improve services and efficiency to better serve our clients. The generation and utilization of GMM is a  technically complex field, with new techniques rapidly evolving. TGC constantly is developing new technical  capabilities and new services to broaden our ability to support GMM usage in cancer research. The vast  majority of services provided by TGC utilize equipment (e.g., tissue culture hoods, molecular biology equipment,  microscopes, and injection devices and surgical tools) that have been in the lab for most of the 16 years of its  existence. Biological systems in use at a given time, technological approaches and the faculty and their interests  constantly evolve.

"9471664","Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis (affecting 8.3 million US adults). The disease is complicated by a high level of cardiovascular-metabolic-renal comorbidities and their sequelae (e.g., myocardial infarction and premature death). Furthermore, remarkably suboptimal gout care has led to frequent flares, a doubling of hospitalization rates, and an increased economic burden in the US. A key reason behind this suboptimal care has been found to be a lack of knowledge or acceptance about the utility/role of serum uric acid (SUA) among primary care providers (PCPs) and patients alike. While the mainstay of gout rheumatology guidelines has been a treat-to-target SUA level (e.g., SUA <6 mg/dL) approach, SUA is not even measured in the majority of patients in current PCP practice, even after ULT is prescribed. In fact, in 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published its own version of guidelines for gout directly refuting this approach by stating that ?There is no evidence from an experimental study that examined the health outcomes of treating to one serum uric acid level versus another, nor is there a trial comparing a strategy of basing treatment on attaining a specific urate level versus basing treatment on reduction in symptoms (such as gout flares).? The obvious implication of the ACP guidelines conflicting with rheumatology guidelines is the worsening of the already suboptimal gout care in the US and beyond. To that end, it is imperative that all stakeholders get together to formulate a plan for where to go from here, particularly with regard to building the evidence necessary to resolve this gout guideline conflict. To initiate this process, we propose to convene a conference (the Taskforce for the Generation of Evidence to Resolve the Gout Care Guideline Conflict [TOGETHER] Conference) including key rheumatology gout investigators, the ACP guideline leadership group, general practitioners, and gout patients (consumers). The aims of the TOGETHER conference are to assemble key investigators and consumer networks to ultimately resolve the gout guideline conflict (Aim 1); to prioritize specific study questions and develop concrete steps to fill the key evidence gaps (Aim 2), and to provide mentorship about evidence generation, guideline development processes, and gout research for young investigators and trainees, with a focus on encouraging the participation and training of females and underrepresented minority groups (Aim 3). It is anticipated that a key outcome of this meeting will be the creation of a network of specialist and GP researchers as well as consumers that will have a productive and collaborative relationship to generate consistent and evidence-based gout care guidelines. The proceedings of this meeting will be disseminated through a web recording and peer-reviewed publication. Consistent with the mission of the NIH/NIAMS, this meeting will successfully specify and prioritize research goals and steps to fill the critical evidence gap, which will ultimately lead to the resolution of the gout guideline conflict, a major additional source of the suboptimal gout care in the US and beyond."
"9447576","ABSTRACT Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects approximately 0.1% of the population and causes substantial morbidity and reduced lifespan. Current treatment is largely based on non- specific immunosuppression which is often only partially effective and may have serious side-effects. The development of more specific, effective and safer therapies is urgently needed. Polymorphisms in the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) are strongly associated in human genetic studies with an increased risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune diseases. IRF5 plays an important role in Toll-like receptor signaling. Deficiency of IRF5 markedly reduces disease severity in a number of mouse models of SLE. Taken together, this suggests that IRF5 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic approach in SLE. The goal of this project is to obtain detailed information about IRF5 function and activation that will lead to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying SLE pathogenesis and potentially to new approaches to inhibit IRF5 and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This will be done by: (1) determining the IRF5- expressing cell type(s) responsible for mediating disease in a mouse model of SLE by deleting IRF5 in specific immune cell types and evaluating the effect of the deletion on disease development; (2) determining whether deletion of IRF5 after disease is established can reverse disease or prevent disease progression in a mouse model of SLE; (3) using the complementary approaches of retrogenic technology and CRISPR gene editing to create novel mouse models to determine the specific phosphorylation site(s) in IRF5 required for lupus pathogenesis in vivo and for IRF5 function and activation in primary immune cells ex vivo; (4) determining how the IRF5 polymorphisms associated with lupus risk modulate IRF5 expression and function in human myeloid dendritic cells. This will be done by making induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers with and without the IRF5 risk polymorphisms and then differentiating the iPS cells into myeloid dendritic cells using a novel in vitro technique. In addition, in order to definitively determine the effect of the IRF5 risk polymorphisms, the polymorphisms will be introduced into non- polymorphic iPS cells using gene editing and functional IRF5 responses will be compared in isogenic myeloid dendritic cells that are genetically identical, except for the risk polymorphism of interest."
"9467000","PROJECT SUMMARY  The cell surface CD47 protein is a marker of ?self? and signals through its receptor, signal-regulatory protein ? (SIRP?) expressed by macrophages, to transmit an anti-phagocytic (?don't-eat-me?) signal. CD47 is expressed by virtually all cell types, is overexpressed by cancer cells as a mechanism to avoid immune surveillance and phagocytosis, and is a negative prognostic factor for survival. Blocking this interaction is of therapeutic interest, because it results in increased cancer cell phagocytosis (innate immunity) as well as priming of a cytotoxic antitumor T-cell response (adaptive immunity). However, due to ubiquitous CD47 expression, anti-CD47 immunotherapies must overcome a large antigen sink (reduced bioavailability), and are limited by on-target/off-tumor toxicity, such as thrombocytopenia and anemia.  In contrast, the receptor SIRP? is mainly expressed on myeloid cells, such that inhibitors targeting SIRP? will have reduced toxicity and increased bioavailability. SIRP? is a transmembrane protein composed of a conserved cytoplasmic tail region and three N-terminal extracellular immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains: one V-set and two C1-set IgSF domains. The related family members SIRP?and SIRP?share homologous IgSF domains, but have distinct cytoplasmic domains and signaling properties. The region of SIRP? that interacts with CD47 is contained within the soluble 118-amino acid N-terminal IgSF V-set domain, making synthesis of this target very feasible.  Using a drug discovery platform that employs enantiomeric screening (mirror-image phage display) coupled with protein design, we have successfully developed protease-stable D-peptide entry inhibitors of HIV, RSV, and Ebola viruses. These inhibitors bind pockets that are similarly involved in functionally critical protein- protein interactions, traditionally deemed undruggable by small molecule approaches. Our anti-HIV D-peptide entry inhibitor is in advanced preclinical trials and was trimerized to simultaneously bind all three pockets on HIV's trimeric envelope protein, resulting in extremely high (pM) potency.  In this 1-year grant application, we propose to discover D-peptides that specifically bind only to SIRP? and inhibit its interaction with CD47, and then characterize their binding profile on SIRP?and SIRP?. D-peptides typically display extended in vivo half-lives and low immunogenicity, and their small size gives them the potential for enhanced tumor penetration. Also, the chemical synthesis of these D-peptides will result in a much more cost-effective cancer immunotherapeutic compared to biologics. Success here will warrant subsequent structural characterization, affinity maturation, testing in cell culture and animal models, and IND-enabling toxicology studies on our D-peptide inhibitors of SIRP? to aid in the treatment of cancer."
"9566480","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of my research is to understand the influence of hematopoietic-specific developmental programs on the repair DNA damage such as double strand breaks (DSBs) and the initial molecular events that lead to translocations, which are a hallmark of leukemia, lymphoma, and soft-tissue sarcomas. DSBs are highly recombinogenic, increasing the exchange of information between two homologous DNA duplexes by several orders of magnitude; thus, mammalian cells are potentially at risk for rearrangements arising during DSB repair. Chromosomal DSBs result following exposure to irradiation, alkylating agents, and topoisomerase II (topoII) inhibitors that are common therapies in the treatment of human cancers. Treatment regimens that include the topoII inhibitor etoposide are associated with one class of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) and chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene on chromosome band 11q23. Similarity of 11q23 MLL breakpoints in t-AML and infant leukemias suggests an association between de novo infant leukemia and in utero exposure to topoII inhibitors. The list of potential topo II inhibitors is extensive, and it remains unclear which of these compounds have a direct potential to induce the chromosomal translocations observed in the clinical setting. Using a unique genetic system to determine the potential for repair of DSBs within the breakpoint cluster regions of the 11q23 MLL gene and common partner genes to result in chromosomal translocations, this proposal will (1) determine the potential for exposure to a range of topoII inhibitors to initiate chromosomal rearrangements within the breakpoint cluster region of the MLL and AF9 genes similar to those observed in the clinical setting; and (2) create a targeted mouse model to determine in vivo the potential for exposure to topoII inhibitors to initiate chromosomal rearrangements within the breakpoint cluster region of the MLL and AF9 genes as measured by the presence of MLL-AF9 genome rearrangements in bone marrow and peripheral blood. These approaches in both ex vivo cell culture and in vivo mouse models will provide significant insight into the initiation of potentially oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements and leukemogenesis. Unraveling the etiology and consequences of translocations may lead to new approaches to therapy and prevention."
"9404499","Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in southern Africa suffer some of the highest risks of HIV infection anywhere in the world. Without reduced incidence in this group, there can be no prospect of epidemic control and the HIV epidemic in high-burden countries will be perpetuated into successive generations. Efficacious prevention methods are now available (including pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], condoms and voluntary medical male circumcision [VMMC] for male partners) but use is low. We hypothesize that the reason why use is low is related to factors acting at individual (preferences and biases), community (peer pressure and social norms) and logistical levels (nature of availability of services); and that interventions that address these barriers will help unlock the potential prevention impact of existing methods. But how these factors interact, and are best addressed with interventions, is poorly understood. This research will address this need to understand the multi-level influences on use of HIV prevention in AGYW and male partners, and will develop new prevention interventions by combining promising approaches from behavioral economics, community psychology, and mathematical modelling. The specific aims are to: 1) use the novel framework of HIV prevention cascades to identify drivers of risks and bottlenecks in HIV prevention for AGYW; 2) use small-scale randomized experiments to pre-test the impact, feasibility, acceptability and cost of behavioral economics and community psychology interventions to strengthen HIV prevention; and 3) estimate the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness if interventions were scaled-up. A household survey will be conducted in 8 sites in east Zimbabwe, covering all AGYW (15-24) and their potential male partners (15-29) and a sub-sample of older people. Questions will cover socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behavior, HIV risk perception, and attitudes towards and perceived availability, uptake and adherence to HIV prevention methods; and tests for HIV and HSV-2 infections will be done. Risk, time and social preferences; risk perception; and cognitive biases will be measured using experimental methods and real rewards, to move beyond self-reported data, and validated using data on HSV-2 and HIV incidence collected after 12 months follow-up. In each site, villages will be randomized into intervention and control villages. In intervention villages, HIV-negative AGYW will participate in feedback-based interactive counselling sessions to increase PrEP uptake by correcting misperceptions of HIV risks and availability, usability and efficacy of PrEP. Uncircumcised HIV-negative young men will receive a counselling session on VMMC by a circumcised young male health worker and further randomized into groups receiving different financial/material rewards for taking up VMMC. Intervention and control participants will be followed-up after 6 months to measure uptake of PrEP (using ARV diagnostics) and VMMC. Both intervention and control AGYW on PrEP will be randomized to a PrEP adherence intervention with personalized short text messages. All AGYW and young men will be followed-up again after 6 months (12 months in total) to measure HIV and HSV-2 incidence and PrEP adherence in AGYW. All data will be used in mathematical models of HIV transmission and HIV prevention cascades to identify bottlenecks in HIV prevention, and assess the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of the pre-tested interventions. This research will also contribute to the evaluation of the DREAMS program in Zimbabwe."
"9405970","ABSTRACT Administrative Core The Administrative Core is responsible for administrative planning, oversight, implementation, and management of the Center. The long-term goal of the Administrative Core is to help a well-integrated and productive Center become even better by ensuring the efficient and productive functioning of the research activities and the maximal utilization of cores, consultants, and advisors. There are six specific aims: (1) facilitate the work of Center investigators, (2) facilitate the mentoring of graduate students, post-docs, and early career researchers; (3) monitor and evaluate the progress being made by projects and cores; (4) facilitate collaboration across projects and cores of the Center, and between Center investigators and investigators at other Centers, Hubs, and institutions; (5) organize regular meetings; and (6) to encourage the work of everyone. Several regular activities are designed to meet these objectives. Bi-monthly meetings are held with all projects and cores being represented, and with graduate students, post docs, and early career researchers being encouraged to attend and participate. One part of the meeting that seems to help promote productivity is that publications in process are always a topic that is asked to be addressed when project and core leaders are updating the group about specific project progress, and the Center bibliography, with publications sorted by project and core, is always reviewed. The NIHMS process is monitored centrally and most investigators take advantage of the Administrative Core's expertise and experience at submitting and shepherding newly accepted manuscripts through the process. Annual meetings with the Advisory Committee are held in Tallahassee. These meetings have proven to be very beneficial, both because of the excellent advice our Committee members provide and because of the preparation by Center investigators that goes on in anticipation of the annual meeting."
"9447474","PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1) Treatment of obesity requires an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the short-term control of food intake, i.e., factors that reduce individual meal size (MS); prolong the time between two consecutive meals, known as the inter-meal interval (IMI); and result in reduction of body weight. The proposed effort will involve evaluation of the anti-obesity effects of the short-term satiety peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) by testing the hypothesis that, if, in diet-induced obese rats, GRP is injected in low amounts and at highly specific gastrointestinal sites, it effectively and safely reduces MS and extends the IMI (i.e., increases satiety), resulting in reduction in body weight. There are three Specific Aims: Specific Aim I: Determine the specific gastrointestinal site(s) of action controlling MS, IMI length, and body weight (BW) by endogenous GRP released by a normal meal. Specific Aim II: Determine the specific gastrointestinal site(s) of action controlling MS, IMI length, and BW by exogenous GRP-10 (a COOH-terminal decapeptide of GRP) and GRP-29 (a large molecular form of GRP). Specific Aim III: Determine the specific gastrointestinal site(s) of action controlling MS, IMI length, and BW by endogenous GRP released by peptone. In addition, the safety of infusions of the peptides and antagonists will be evaluated by examining the morphology and weights of the specific gut sites of action following single and chronic infusions of GRP. We will test these three aims by innovative approaches, including use of (a) microvascular catheterization of the major arteries and their branches in the gut, (b) a sensitive enzyme immunoassay that determines the levels of GRP in response to meals; (c) immunohistochemical detection of Fos-like immunoreactivity, a marker for neuronal activation in the enteric neurons and in the dorsal vagal complex; (d) diet-induced obese rats; and (e) the automated BioDAQ feeding apparatus. This work will establish, in diet-induced obese rats, the specific site(s) of action regulating meal size, IMI, and BW by endogenous and exogenous GRP and will determine if GRP can be tested in humans as an anti-obesity medication."
"9411848","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The overall objective of this functional bladder mapping study is to identify the spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) configurations (anode/cathode selection, amplitude, frequency and pulse width) at the lumbosacral level that can promote neural control of bladder storage (capacity) and voiding efficiency after spinal cord injury (SCI). This comprehensive functional mapping study in both humans and animals in parallel involves a novel clinical application of a marketed Medtronic device for bladder dysfunction after SCI. The mapping (human and animal) and training (human) experiments address several specific objectives of the SPARC Program initiative per RFA-RM-15-018 including neural circuit maps regarding functional connectivity (Aim 1), neural plasticity related to stimulation (bladder training experiments ? Aim 2), variability (animal-to- animal and patient-to-patient), and research on what organ functions results from different types of stimulation (storage vs voiding and identifying any additional effects on bowel and/or sexual function).  The long-term reduction in the cost to the health care system, care givers and society would be dramatic. SCI results in impairments of locomotor, sensory and autonomic functions, severely affecting overall health and quality of life. Proper bladder management post-SCI is necessary to decrease the risk of upper urinary tract disease, a major source of morbidity. Life-long urologic care is required for SCI individuals, yet most efforts treat symptoms but do not improve intrinsic function. Current therapies for bladder management after SCI include catheterization, pharmacologic and surgical interventions, functional electrical stimulation (peripheral), and urethral stents, but all have deleterious effects. We have exciting data from multiple individuals with severe injuries (AIS A and B) indicating improved bladder function after undergoing a widely implemented activity-based rehabilitation, locomotor training (LT), which includes stepping using body weight support on a treadmill with manual facilitation. In addition, we have intriguing preliminary data from several completely paralyzed individuals receiving scES in combination with task specific training that recovered standing and voluntary movement and showed improvements in both bladder capacity and voiding efficiency. Our most recent pilot data also indicate an immediate benefit of scES alone on bladder function. Thus, we propose to determine the functional gains that can be achieved in the storage and voiding phases of lower urinary tract function as a result of activation of spinal circuits with scES in humans with SCI and in a clinically- relevant rodent SCI model. We will test the general hypothesis that bladder capacity and voiding efficiency increases with scES post-SCI and to an even greater extent with scES bladder training over time.  This proposal involves the collaboration of clinicians and scientists with extensive experience in animal and human SCI models. Our unique approach will utilize the expertise of a multi-disciplinary team (expertise in bladder function, neuromodulation, rehabilitation, engineering, and statistics) to 1) determine the optimal stimulation parameters for storage and voiding in SCI research participants already implanted with the scES Medtronic device (16-electrode array from L1-S1); 2) quantify the long-term effects of daily bladder training using optimal stimulation parameters (all the same research participants); 3) measurement of secondary benefits (bladder medication usage, susceptibility to urinary tract infections, indirect cardiovascular, bowel and sexual function benefits) of long-term bladder training; and 4) address with a small animal model the impact of location, lesion severity, chronicity and gender. Our innovative approach and novel application of this Medtronic Specify 5-6-5 device will allow us to determine specific types of scES needed for bladder function which will lay the groundwork for expedient translation of this promising technique to larger numbers of individuals with SCI in the next phase of the SPARC initiative, with additional refinement in parallel using a large animal SCI model (pig) that is currently under development within the Kentucky Spinal Cord Research Center."
"9449725","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of SHERC is to increase basic biomedical, clinical, and behavioral research at NAU to address health disparities among diverse populations of the Southwestern United States. In the first 5 years, we will increase research capacity in the areas of environmental and community health, building on a strong research base at NAU. Over time, SHERC will work closely with community partners to expand capacity to address health disparities in chronic and infectious diseases, as well as high-priority behavioral health conditions, as determined by community partners. SHERC consists of five cores that all interact synergistically. Each of the SHERC cores provides a clear opportunity for innovation individually; in combination, they demonstrate significant impact in innovation. The Administrative Core combines evidence-based organizational theory with a tested but novel use of a ?continuous improvement? model of program assessment and feedback. The Research Infrastructure Core will focus on infrastructure improvement for the SHERC basic research, informatics, clinical, and community engaged science programs. In addition, it will take a leadership role in improving the interdisciplinary science efforts in biomedical, clinical, and community health science initiatives throughout NAU. The Investigator Development Core will support the development of early career investigators in basic biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences at NAU through two innovative programs: a Pilot Project Program (PPP) to support faculty and a Postdoctoral Scholar Program (PSP) to support and mentor postdoctoral researchers. The Community Engagement Core uses an innovative four- direction Framework for Inquiry and Action that will represent the shared and distinct determinants of health in Arizona. The five Research Projects include the following innovative studies: Pearson's research project will define and contrast S. aureus carriage and circulating genotypes with clinical genotypes and infection prevalence to better understand how social interactions impact transmission. Kellar and Propper seek to enhance current research on the relationship between environmental contaminants and clinical complications such as non-healing chronic wounds. The Varadaraj study will exploit a cellular adaptation in tumors, to determine whether altering fibrillogenesis in such states will switch premalignant cells to malignant cells and whether preinvasive cells would become invasive. Naren's study has the potential to improve and extend reovirus based cancer therapies. Fofonav's study may identify individuals with an oral microbiome that is more susceptible to early childhood caries (ECC) or individuals with particularly pathogenic strains of S. mutans and S. sobrinus."
"9367277","PROJECT SUMMARY Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging antigen-mediated chronic inflammatory disease, characterized by mucosal eosinophilia and tissue remodeling events, leading to basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and subepithelial fibrosis. While immune cell-mediated mechanisms regulating EoE disease activity are rapidly emerging, our understanding of the relationship between esophageal epithelial biology and EoE pathogenesis is presently limited. Autophagy is a cellular adaptive response to physiologic stressors that is activated in esophageal epithelia upon exposure to EoE inflammation to limit oxidative stress. Pharmacological autophagy inhibition aggravates disease-associated oxidative stress, basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and eosinophil infiltrates in a robust murine model of EoE, suggesting that autophagy supports esophageal homeostasis via cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms in the context of EoE inflammation. The present proposal utilizes murine models with squamous epithelia-specific autophagy impairment coupled with ex vivo esophageal 3D organoids, reconstitute the epithelial-stromal structure in the organotypic 3D culture and EoE patient specimens with associated clinical data as a comprehensive platform to define the mechanistic and functional role of autophagy in EoE pathogenesis. The central hypothesis is that epithelial autophagy is a fundamental mucosal defense mechanism activated to suppress reactive oxygen species-mediated esophageal tissue remodeling in EoE. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory and will be tested by pursuing the following three interrelated Specific Aims: (1) To determine how autophagy influences epithelial cell fate in the EoE inflammatory milieu; (2) To determine the effect of epithelial autophagy on lamina propria remodeling; (3) To evaluate the therapeutic utility of autophagy activation in EoE. These innovative studies will reveal novel insight into the role of autophagy in regulation of epithelial integrity and epithelial-stromal crosstalk in the context of EoE, thereby fundamentally advance the fields of epithelial biology and mucosal defense. By evaluating the therapeutic utility of pharmacological autophagy enhancement in EoE, these studies have the potential for direct translational impact in this disease for which dietary elimination and/or swallowed corticosteroids therapy remain the current standard of care due to a lack of viable targeted therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, this novel therapeutic strategy may serve as a platform for similar approaches in the treatment of esophageal disorders beyond EoE in which BCH and inflammation have been implicated as well as additional human pathologies involving autophagy dysregulation. Thus, this innovative and translational research will have substantial positive impact by integrating basic science and preclinical experimental approaches to define the direct molecular mechanisms underlying esophageal epithelial homeostasis and utilizing this knowledge to direct the development of novel translational applications related to EoE diagnosis, monitoring and therapy."
"9433329","PROJECT SUMMARY With the number of human health studies involving metabolomics rising at a rapid rate, the development of methods to address critical analytic barriers in the analysis of metabolomics data is of critical importance. Missing values (MVs) are a pervasive, and often ignored, issue in metabolomics, yet the treatment of MVs can have a substantial impact on differential abundance and other downstream statistical analyses. The MVs problem in metabolomics is quite challenging, namely because the source of MVs is not always clear and can arise because the metabolite is i) not biologically present in the sample, ii) present in the sample but at a concentration below the lower limit of detection (LOD), or iii) present in the sample but undetected due to technical issues related to sample pre-processing steps (e.g. peak resolution). Current commonly used methods (e.g., substitution by zeros, LOD, or the mean value) tend to be overly-simplistic and produce sub-optimal and potentially misleading results. Since there is a noticeable absence of imputation methods from the literature that properly account for the different types of missingness in metabolomics data, there is an urgent need to invest in improving statistical models of MVs that are specific to metabolomics. We have recently developed a modified K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation algorithm that accounts for the truncation point (i.e., the LOD) in the data (KNN-TN). Based on simulations derived from real metabolomics studies, this algorithm showed considerable improvement in imputation accuracy (root-mean squared error) compared to single value (LOD, mean, zero) imputation approaches and standard KNN imputation. In this proposal, we will develop an alternative Bayesian modeling approach that accounts for the uncertainty due to imputation and stabilizes estimates for small samples by sharing information across metabolites. Further, we will evaluate the impact of MV imputation on downstream statistical analyses based on simulations from a wide-variety of publicly available datasets from the Metabolomics Workbench. Our analyses will allow us to make comprehensive recommendations to analysts about which imputation algorithm(s) are optimal in terms of biological impact. Lastly, we will develop publicly available software for implementing all developed imputation methods, including a web-accessible interface to broaden outreach and impact. The overall long term goal of this proposal is to develop user-friendly software and best-practices guidelines for imputation strategies in metabolomics data, thereby improving accuracy of downstream statistical analysis and the resulting biological impact."

"9406412","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Comorbidity is pervasive among the learning disabilities (LDs) (comorbidity rates of 25-50%) and is a key predictor of academic and functional outcomes, yet little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that increase a child?s risk for multiple disorders. This project proposes a multiple deficit model of LDs where shared cognitive risk factors contribute to comorbidity of reading and math (basic and higher-order skills) and ADHD. The overall goal of this project is to use converging methods, including latent modeling, experimental methods, and behavioral genetics, to identify the role of shared cognitive risk factors in the comorbidity of LDs and ADHD. Potential shared cognitive deficits between learning disabilities and ADHD include processing speed (PS), executive functions (EFs), and specific domains of implicit learning. Although these factors have each been examined in LDs individually, this is the first study to assess the impact of these related constructs on comorbidity across LDs. One challenge with the PS construct is the ?task impurity? of the measures. To address this concern, we will systematically examine 4 theoretical models (some non-exclusive) about the role of PS in LDs and ADHD: (1) PS is reducible to cognitive g, (2) PS is reducible to EF, (3) PS is a domain- general factor, (4) PS has content-specific components that are associated with specific academic skills. Aim 1 will examine these 4 models by introducing new experimental PS tasks and leveraging existing data with advanced latent models of the shared and unique variance among the constructs. Another potential shared cognitive risk factor among learning disabilities are deficits in implicit learning, specifically the subdomains of procedural learning and statistical learning, which we have not yet studied in this sample. Aim 1 will include new measures of procedural (motor-based) and statistical (language-based) learning. This will be the first study to examine the association of these constructs with multiple LDs and ADHD. Because this LD center employs a genetically-sensitive twin design, we will be able to draw genetic inferences from the best-fitting cognitive models. In Aim 2, we will determine whether shared cognitive risk factors also share genetic relationships with the comorbid LDs. The population of bilingual youth is growing exponentially in the US, yet we still know very little about academic development in this population. In Aim 3, we plan to test the best-fitting multiple deficit model from Aim 1 in a sample of bilingual, Hispanic youth. This analysis will be an important test of the universality of the multiple deficit model where points of divergence will have important clinical implications. The focus of this project on identifying and dissecting shared cognitive risk factors for LDs and ADHD has clinical relevance for assessment of comorbidity risk and for novel treatment targets that may impact generalized cognitive risk mechanisms."
"9358913","TRD 1: FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY AND MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES Investigators: P. So (1.1, 1.2) [lead]; M. Bawendi (1.2); G. Schlau-cohen (1.3) Collaborative Projects: Jain (CP1), Boyden (CP4), Campagnola (CP8), Coleman (CP9) Project Summary: Fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging are key techniques in the repertoire of the biomedical research community. In the LBRC, the investigators leverage their expertise in precision spectroscopy, contrast agent development, and coherent spatial and temporal control of ultrafast pulses to develop cutting-edge technologies for analyte-specific investigation of biological systems, from proteins to whole organisms. This fluorescence-based TRD builds upon 3D light sculpting techniques and short-wave infrared (SWIR) technologies developed in the current cycle with three exciting new directions: high-throughput deep SWIR imaging (TRD1.1), high-throughput, super-resolution 3D imaging (TRD1.2), and the nanometer- scale study of protein motions (TRD1.3). These directions are motivated by LBRC collaborations. Pushed by the study of cancer biology inside thick solid tumors in vivo, especially for monitoring dynamic events like blood flow and variations in oxygenation (CP1), TRD1.1 seeks to optimize both imaging speed and depth by combining patterned two-photon temporally focused wide-field excitation with compressive-sensing algorithms to image ultra-bright quantum dots (TRD4). Pushed also by Dr. Boyden's work to map the connection diagram of the brain (CP4), which in turn requires high-throughput identification of synaptic clefts at 50 nm resolution throughout a 0.5 cm3 volume. Based on our expertise in structured illumination (SI) and point spread function (PSF) engineering, TRD1.2 seeks to improve super-resolution imaging speed to approach 1G voxel/sec in order to map the whole brain within ~1 year. The same super-resolution approach is employed for high- throughput 3D microfabrication of an extracellular matrix to control cancer cell migration and tissue regeneration (CP8). Finally, pushed by the need for new insight into the signaling mechanisms of receptors, which are the targets of cancer therapeutics (CP9), TRD1.3 will develop fluorescence spectroscopy tools with nanometer spatial and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. In summary, this TRD further extends the core strength of the LBRC in fluorescence instrumentation by introducing these three new research directions."
"9452250","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: The reports of side effects on clinical trials describe expected toxicities of chemotherapy. However, these side effects, also called adverse events, are globally under-reported on trials, which means that clinicians do not have an accurate sense of adverse event rates. In the current system, adverse events are identified through time-consuming, manual medical record review. This study aims to develop a system that uses electronic medical record data to capture complex adverse events of chemotherapy for pediatric cancer and to prove that this method is more accurate than the current adverse event reporting system. The specific aims of this application are to 1) develop algorithms to identify 10 complex adverse events using electronic medical record data from children treated for acute leukemia at two large children's hospitals, 2) compare the accuracy of this new method to that of the current system, and 3) demonstrate the utility of electronic adverse event capture in answering clinical questions by defining the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury. Methods: This study will use data from 1900 children with acute leukemia treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or the Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) from 2002 through 2017. Algorithms will be developed to identify adverse events by extracting electronic medical record data at CHOP. Once finalized, the algorithms will be tested at TCH. Using chart abstraction data as the gold standard, the accuracy of electronic ascertainment and of trial adverse event reports will determined, and the relative accuracy of each method will be compared. Lastly, algorithms will extract creatinine results from the electronic medical record and the incidence of acute kidney injury will be determined for each leukemia type and by chemotherapy regimen. Risk factors for acute kidney injury will be explored. Career Goals and Environment: With the support of this K07 award, the applicant, Tamara P. Miller, MD, MSCE, will learn how to use electronic medical record data for clinical research, obtain formal training in clinical informatics and implementation science, develop expertise in clinical trial design, and improve her knowledge of pediatric oncology and skills in scientific writing. To complete these training goals, Dr. Miller has assembled an experienced, complementary, and nurturing mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Richard Aplenc, MD, PhD. Her training plan includes formal coursework in informatics, tutorials, national conferences, and research progress and writing groups. She will benefit from the outstanding depth of resources and opportunities at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania. Her long-term goal is to integrate the novel system of adverse event ascertainment she creates into pediatric oncology trials and to use the accurate datasets she develops to answer clinically important questions. With this award, Dr. Miller will be well-positioned to transition to her goal of an independent clinical research career focused on improving adverse event reporting and supportive care practices in pediatric oncology."
"9466512","Project Summary/Abstract Protein therapeutics are the fastest growing segment of the pharmaceutical market, yet there are two important challenges associated with the discovery and development of biologic drugs: epitope/paratope mapping and 3D structural analysis. Epitope and paratope mapping are essential parts of identifying the most therapeutically relevant lead candidates for advancement to in vivo testing. Accurately mapping epitopes can help identify therapeutic candidates that bind to the desired region of an antigen based on the mechanism of action, while characterizing paratopes frequently forms the basis for intellectual property strategies. Protein 3D structural analysis is crucial for many downstream activities throughout the drug development process, and it most often is required to ensure that manufacturing, shipping, storage, and formulation do not have an unintended impact on protein structure. In addition, 3D structural analysis plays a critical role in ensuring biosimilars under development are structurally similar to their branded originator drug. Current analytical strategies for epitope/paratope mapping and 3D structural analysis of protein therapeutics are often inadequate for the early stages of drug discovery and development. In response, QuarryBio and its research partners at Indiana University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst have developed a new mass spectrometry-based method that uses covalent labeling to identify epitopes and paratopes and can detect changes in protein 3D structure accurately and sensitively. Research during Phase I demonstrated that this method is quick, easy to use and provides sufficient resolution for both epitope mapping and 3D structural analysis of protein therapeutics. Success during Phase I was possible because of the creation of a customized data analysis software pipeline that could successfully identify and quantify covalently labeled sites in proteins, allowing the needed protein structural information to be obtained. Phase II will build off these successful preliminary studies, thereby preparing this technology for commercialization. Three specific aims will be pursued: 1) we will demonstrate the ability of our covalent labeling technology to provide robust structural information and to map epitopes and paratopes in mAb/antigen complexes; 2) we will automate data analysis and visualization by creating protocols that minimize the manual manipulations associated with our customized software; and 3) we will develop laboratory automation for sample preparation activities to improve the reproducibility of our measurements. At the end of Phase II, we expect that our covalent labeling technology and data analysis software pipeline will be fully ready for commercialization. QuarryBio has fee-for-service contracts in place with seven biotech clients, demonstrating the commercial potential of this technology. The work proposed here will significantly improve the quality, reproducibility, and throughput of our approach and demonstrate how our methodology can be used for key decision steps during early stage biologic drug discovery and development."
"9447826","SUMMARY Columnar metaplasia, including Barrett?s esophagus (BE), is considered a precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma which has seen a 600% fold increase in incidence over the last three decades. BE occurs exclusively at the esophageal-gastro junction where the stratified squamous epithelium transitions into simple columnar cells. In patients with BE the junction moves anteriorly and the columnar epithelium is expanded, meanwhile gaining intestinal differentiation characteristics in some cases. Significantly, the cell-of-origin of the metaplastic columnar epithelium remains controversial. Here, we identify a novel pseudostratified epithelium maintained by a unique basal progenitor cell population (p63+, KRT5+, KRT7+) at the squamous-columnar junction (SCJ). Our preliminary data suggest that the unique epithelium serves as the origin for BE metaplastic epithelium in multiple mouse models. Our data further indicate that Wnt signaling promotes metaplastic changes at the SCJ. We therefore hypothesize that columnar metaplasia including BE is derived from the unique basal progenitor cells (p63+, KRT5+, KRT7+), a process promoted by Wnt signaling. We will test the hypothesis with three specific aims: Aim 1: To further test that the basal progenitor cells (p63+, KRT5+, KRT7+) are the cells- of-origin for columnar metaplasia including BE. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that Wnt signaling promotes columnar metaplasia at the SCJ and that inhibition of this signaling blocks disease progression. Aim 3: To model the human BE pathogenic process with hESC-derived basal progenitor cells of the columnar epithelium. We have established a robust in vitro system to induce the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells towards basal cell fate. In this aim we will use this system to understand the mechanism driving the abnormal differentiation of basal cells during BE development. Together findings from this project will contribute important insights into early BE pathogenesis and provide potential therapeutic targets for treatment."
"9560293","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC?s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program."
"9381396","Project Summary  In current risk assessment and counseling practices, all women who test positive for a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation are quoted the same general range of ovarian cancer risk and are given the same recommendation regarding utilization of risk reducing salpingo- oophorectomy (RRSO) and other preventive measures. We have recently published a model that reports substantial and clinically relevant differences in risk depending on the specific mutation a woman has inherited. In particular, we have recently shown that specific mutations confer an increased risk or earlier age of onset for breast or ovarian cancer compared with the generic risk estimates made for any BRCA1/2 mutation. In addition, risk estimates that consider previous exposure to important risk factors (e.g., reproductive history, oral contraceptive use, or preventive surgery use) may have a large impact on cancer risk estimates in this population. More precise risk information could be critical for optimal decision-making for women who are considering cancer prevention strategies.  Based on these initial observations, we propose to develop precision absolute risk models that incorporate information about mutation risk group, to apply in vitro methods to identify new clinically relevant BRCA1/2 mutations and validate their capacity to cause disease, and to gain a better understanding of how personal values affect how individual women interpret and act on risk estimates, for use in a future decision aid intervention. Thus, this proposal will develop a ?precision prevention? approach to BRCA1/2-associated cancer risk to lower the chances a woman will die from ovarian cancer, and will have immediate translational impact for women with BRCA1/2 mutations."
"9403952","PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD afflicts nearly 1.5 million people in the United States. The exact causes of IBD are unknown, but they are thought to generally involve dysregulated host immune responses to commensal microorganisms in genetically susceptible individuals. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a major immune cytokine, has a central role in the disease process. While anti-TNF therapies are a part of the medical regimen for many IBD patients, there is mounting evidence that the complete blockade of TNF signaling is not appropriate in the long-term for many. For example, most patients treated with anti-TNF biologics stop responding to the therapy within 5 years. We and others have demonstrated that TNF signaling through its lesser-characterized receptor TNFR2 has many beneficial functions on the repair of the colonic epithelial barrier, a crucial mitigating aspect of IBD, and on the regulation of immune cells including cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes and regulatory T cells. This application will follow-up on these novel observations to explore the mechanisms that underlie TNFR2's protective effects on CD8+ T cells and colonic epithelial stem cell populations in the setting of colonic injury and inflammation. Specifically, we will: 1) determine the mechanisms by which TNFR2 regulates the pathogenicity of CD8+ T cells in colitis, 2) elucidate the role of TNFR2 in regulation of CD8+ T cell subpopulations and their colonic localization, and 3) define the role of epithelial TNFR2 on colonic epithelial stem cell dynamics and mucosal healing. These studies will reveal important cellular and molecular patterns that may underlie the pathophysiology of IBD."
"9356307","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): PD: Pascual, V. OVERVIEW PROJECT SUMMARY We propose an integrated, cooperative Center for Lupus Research (CLR) based at the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research in Dallas, TX, and the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine in Farmington, CT. The goal of the CLR is to advance the knowledge of pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the development and amplification of human Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and to develop assays and tools to i) monitor these dysfunctional pathways and ii) stratify patients towards personalized therapies. The scope and goals of the CLR are based on data accumulated through longitudinal assessment of pediatric lupus patients followed for over a decade. Using validated clinical measures of disease activity (DA) and blood gene expression profiling, we identified gene signatures correlating with DA at the cohort level. Personalized immunomonitoring revealed, however, significant heterogeneity in molecular pathways correlating with DA at the individual patient level. We now propose to capitalize on the expression profiling approaches we pioneered, while leveraging the outstanding power of new genomic technologies, to address how the three most prevalent signatures, related to IFN, Myeloid cells and Plasmablasts/Plasma Cells, underpin SLE pathogenesis. Towards our goal, we gathered a multidisciplinary team of scientists (including immunologists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians and software engineers) and Physician-Scientists/Clinicians with deep experience in the clinical management of SLE. This team has worked efficiently together for years?from bedside-to-bench and from bench-to-bedside?to understand and treat human immunological diseases. The CLR is structured around two complementary research projects, each of which adopts a translational, technology-driven approach to understanding key molecular aspects of SLE. In Project 1, we will dissect cellular and molecular components of these signatures. The analysis will proceed to the single cell level, will include flares and remissions, and will interrogate steady and activation states. In Project 2, we will characterize the repertoire of immune cell isoforms and epigenome profiles associated with the three major SLE molecular groups. In both projects we will incorporate cutting-edge technologies and build upon our established expertise in molecular immune profiling. The projects will be critically supported by two research cores. The Center's Clinical and Sample Core will oversee all aspects of clinical assessment, clinical data collection and sample storage and distribution. The Center's Genomics and Data Management Core will provide state-of-the-art genomics technologies and data management capabilities for the Center. The Administrative Core will ensure effective communication across the Center, and oversee pilot projects that complement the scope and goals of the core. Successful completion of these projects will yield an unprecendented knowledgebase of genomic and functional data, as well as novel molecular targets for new diagnostics or personalized therapeutics that could transform the clinical management of SLE.

"9444172","Summary/Abstract (30 lines) The mission of the Advanced Imaging and Instrumentation Core will be to deliver the necessary technical skill, training and resources to enable the complex in-vivo research projects proposed. The current U19 proposal is only possible thanks to very recent developments in in-vivo imaging, recording and manipulation techniques that have enabled real-time studies in awake behaving mice. In particular, it is essential to leverage in-vivo, awake measurement techniques to study motor control since one must be able to measure associated motor output and task performance. Our Advanced Imaging and Instrumentation Core is composed of key experts in the development and deployment of novel technologies, 2 of them BRAIN Initiative grant awardees. However, it is important to note that the technologies to be deployed here will not require significant high-risk innovation, but rather represent the integration and implementation of recently demonstrate breakthrough techniques for rigorous application to studying motor circuits. These include 3-photon in-vivo functional microscopy, Adaptive optics assisted photo manipulation, wide-field optical mapping and meso-scale two-photon microscopy. These imaging methods will be combined with innovative surgical preparations, tasks, electrode recordings and closed-loop strategies. Importantly, none of these technologies is available commercially, and thus the core will need to ensure that these systems are quickly and effectively established and supported throughout the duration of the project. Documentation of this development will be accompanied by adoption of ever evolving new technologies as they become available. The Advanced Imaging and Instrumentation Core will also play an important role in training and enabling researcher to adopt complex techniques, while working closely with the Data Science Resource core on all aspects of data standardization, archiving, analysis and dissemination. Overall, this core will represent a deep collaboration between experts in the development and deployment of novel technologies, in collaboration with those leveraging the power of these important systems."
"9525094","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase 1) is an enzyme that can block the flow of biochemical information by catalyzing the cleavage of cellular RNA. Our intent is to use ideas and methods from enzymology, biochemistry and molecular biology, cell biology, and molecular genetics to reveal attributes of the structure and function of RNase 1 that can lead to toxic activity against cancer cells, to enhance that activity, and to reveal fundamental information on the role of RNase 1 in mammalian biology. During the next grant period, this intent will be achieved in five Specific Aims. Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we shall identify specific glycans on the surface of human cells that interact with RNase 1, characterize those interactions, and assess their biological relevance. In Aim 2, we shall develop small-molecule fluorogenic probes for two critical steps in RNase 1-mediated cytotoxicity: endocytosis and endosomal escape. In Aim 3, we shall determine the fate of cellular RNA exposed to an RI-evasive variant of RNase 1, and whether the products of catalysis by RNase 1 are substrates for a cytosolic enzyme, RtcB. In Aim 4, we shall produce RNase 1 with human-like glycosylation and determine the effect of the glycans on the biochemical and biological attributes of the enzyme. In Aim 5, we shall create mice in which the gene that encodes the mouse homolog of RNase 1 has been disrupted in a conditional manner. We shall characterize the phenotype of these mice so as to reveal the role(s) of RNase 1 in a mammal. Significance: The results of the research proposed herein will provide a detailed biochemical understanding of the antitumor activity of RNase 1, and could ultimately lead to new chemotherapeutic agents based on variants of an endogenous human enzyme."

"9440292","Summary In recent years, opioid use disorder (OUD) and deaths due to opiate overdose (e.g., with heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone) in suburban and rural non-minority groups has created an urgency for approaches to stem this epidemic, but the rise in OUD and opiate overdose deaths has occurred in inner cities at similar rates. Heroin misuse and addiction are persistent problems in African-American communities and in inner cities, and a widely understudied trend is that addiction to opioid medication and heroin has become the major cause of morbidity, crime and infectious disease in a huge segment of the African American population. Despite recent efforts to expand addiction research recruitment to include minorities, significant race disparities persist for African-Americans, and this disparity negatively impacts access to affordable but sophisticated treatment mechanisms available to other groups. OUD disrupts reward processing within the mesocorticolimbic system, a process that is, in part, rooted in genetics. Our preliminary studies suggest that ancestry- specific SNPs may govern addiction behavior in specific groups: African-Americans express the dopamine receptor DRD2A1 allele at double the frequency of European-Americans. Moreover, pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing in a cohort of heroin addicts at our facility reveal a significant 85% frequency of the CYP3A4 *1B allele, the variant which confers rapid metabolism of the treatment drug, buprenorphine, a mu opioid agonist. These ancestry-specific findings are further corroborated by GWAS studies in drug addicted patients, where the intronic SNP in the KAT2B (Lysine acetyl transferase 2B) gene was specifically identified in African-Americans and not in European-American addicts. Based on this scientific premise, we hypothesize that opioid use in African-Americans will be associated with hypodopaminergic alleles that alter the threshold for activating feelings of reward and pleasure within the dopaminergic system, and that these allelic frequencies will differ significantly from European Americans. We propose to develop a targeted system to study genetic risks for reward deficiency using risk gene panel to assign a genetic addiction risk score (GARS), comprehensive surveys to determine quality of life and exposure to stressors and trauma. This system will allow prediction of addiction and relapse potential and delivery of personalized treatment. We further propose to develop a dosing strategy for a Neuroadaptogen- amino-acid therapy (NAAT) that will reduce the incidence of relapse to opioid use. This is a Systematic Medical Approach to Reward Transformation (SMART) for brain health and opioid use disorders in a mostly African-American population in Phase 1 where we will 1) validate the GARS scoring system against PGx data and ethnically and culturally sensitive life situations 2) Assess the effectiveness of the reward system- targeted NAAT as an effective treatment to reduce relapse in genetically identified high and low risk groups and 3) Develop a database: the SMART Clinical Genomic Registry to facilitate management of clinical, social, and genomic data. This approach promotes brain health even in non- opioid users."

"9465522","Project Summary/Abstract Diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems affect the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. Progress in understanding the function of neural networks and in developing associated insights into the underlying causes of these diseases can be accelerated by advances in techniques and methodologies for neuroscience research. Collaborative efforts between the Rogers and Bruchas groups recently yielded a wireless, battery-powered system for fluid delivery and optogenetics in a single, head-mounted platform. These probes operate without physical connection to external light or fluid sources or power supply systems, thereby greatly simplifying the equipment requirements and user interfaces for the investigator. The complex, multi-part construction and the required batteries limit the manufacturability and the size/weight/operating time of the system, respectively. The proposed program focuses on the development of a wireless, battery-free platform with similar functionality but in a low-cost, manufacturable design that is fully compatible with a commercially available wireless electronic platform and control software from the company NeuroLux. This technology represents an important advance in tools for neuroscience research, with many application possibilities and unique advantages over any other research or commercial alternative. The Specific Aims of the proposed work are to (1) develop a wireless, battery-free electrochemical micropump, (2) integrate electrochemical micropumps with ultrathin, soft microfluidic and microscale inorganic light emitting diode (?-ILED) probes, and associated wireless, battery-free electronics and (3) evaluate the efficacy and robustness of optofluidic devices in awake, behaving animals in behavioral tests."
"9409372","PROJECT DESCRIPTION ? JSK Therapeutics (JSKT) Direct to Phase II Application Nitric oxide (NO) is a potentially powerful therapy against cancer. Spontaneous NO-generating drugs cannot be used to treat malignancies because of the pleiotropic effects of NO. In particular, NO is a potent vasodilator with resultant hypotension. In order to make NO-based cancer therapy possible, it is necessary to develop agents that deliver NO preferentially to malignant cells. In collaboration with Dr. Larry Keefer at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Paul Shami has developed such a drug using compounds that release NO upon interaction with glutathione (GSH) in a reaction catalyzed by Glutathione S-Transferases (GST). This drug design exploits the over-expression of GST in malignant cells. A lead compound was identified as the most active of this family: O2-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl) piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate, or JS- K. JS-K has potent and broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Because of challenging solubility and stability properties, the Shami lab has developed a formulation for JS-K using Pluronic P123 micelles. JS-K formulated in P123 micelles (P123/JS-K) was well tolerated in a non-GLP dog toxicology study without the induction of hypotension. JS-K is directly cytotoxic to malignant cells and also an inhibitor of angiogenesis. JS-K is a very efficient consumer of the anti-oxidant tripeptide glutathione (GSH), rendering malignant cells particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. JS-K is not toxic towards normal hematopoietic cells. JS-K is synergistic with cytarabine against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and with bortezomib against multiple myeloma (MM). Recent data suggest that JS-K may sensitize MM cells to the cytotoxic effect of natural killer (NK) cells, raising the possibility of synergistic combinations with novel immunomodulatory agents. One kilogram of JS-K Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient was produced under cGMP conditions. JSK Therapeutics (JSKT) was founded to lead commercialization of JS-K. The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted orphan drug designation for JS-K for the indications of AML and MM. JSKT plans to develop JS-K initially for the treatment of AML and MM. The objective of this project is to complete pre-clinical animal toxicology studies needed to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. In 4 aims, an analytical method for the measurement of JS-K in biologic matrices will be developed and validated; GLP toxicology studies in rats and dogs using a schedule of administration that reproduces the prospective clinical schedule will be conducted; GLP lung and central nervous system toxicology studies will be conducted in rats; and a GLP cardiovascular system toxicology study will be conducted in dogs. At the completion of this project, JSKT will submit an IND application to the FDA in order to start Phase I clinical trials for relapsed/refractory AML and MM. This will allow partnering with an established pharmaceutical company or obtaining venture investment in order to complete the clinical development and commercialization of JS-K, thus adding a potent new drug to our armamentarium aimed at diminishing the pain and suffering associated with cancer."
"9416018","PROJECT SUMMARY The role of a neuronal cell type in the generation of perception and behavior depends on three major factors. These are: the sources of synaptic input, how synaptic inputs are integrated to give rise to spiking output, and the population of neurons that receive the output. This Research Segment (Segment 2 - Anatomy. Linking Cell Types Defined by Epigenetic Profiling to Neural Circuits) will link putative cell types defined by epigenetic profiling (Segment 1) to their inputs and outputs. This knowledge will link genetically targetable cell types to circuits, allowing future manipulative studies to assess their functional roles within intact neural circuits. Nearly all brain regions, including those that will be dissected and subject to epigenetic profiling in Segment 1, either contain multiple intermingled cell types or they are composed of nuclei too small to be selectively dissected. However, because individual nuclei or intermingled cell types typically project axons to unique distant brain structures, they can be identified based on their axonal outputs. Efforts here will generate epigenetic profiles of neurons with known projections, to link profiled populations to their outputs. Monosynaptic rabies tracing will then be used to link inputs across the entire brain to cell types defined based on their outputs. Finally, putative cell type specific enhancers, whose ability to drive cell type specific expression will be initially evaluated in Research Segment 4, will be further characterized. This includes further characterization of the cell types that drive expression from identified enhancers using anatomical analysis of their distributions within the brain, as well as the patterns of projections of their axonal arbors. The ability to use enhancers to target cell types for selective gene expression and anatomical characterization of the targeted cell types will make available the full arsenal of molecular and genetic tools for interrogating the functional roles of these cell types within intact neural circuits."
"9484564","PROJECT SUMMARY Place matters for health. Residential segregation has been linked to higher mortality, poorer access and lower quality of health care for racial/ethnic minorities. However, much remains unknown about the why place matters. In particular, the role of place-based characteristics such as rurality and income segregation in health care disparities is not well studied. A better understanding of how these place-based characteristics intersect with residential segregation by race-ethnicity to influence health care access, quality and disparities could be essential for developing interventions and policy solutions that are attentive to the local context. Our studies under the Why Place Matters research program found residents of minority communities had lower access to primary care and specialists and reduced use of physician, non-physician and mental health services compared to residents of majority white communities. Leveraging the comprehensive data resources developed through our research program, our team will conduct secondary analyses to explore the role of several important, but understudied, place characteristics on health care disparities. Specifically, our study will examine the associations of: 1) rurality, 2) income segregation, and 3) language segregation on minority health care access and utilization. We will examine these relationships for different race-ethnic groups (e.g., Blacks, Hispanics) and on care disparities between race-ethnic minority groups with Whites. We will also test whether provider availability or quality mediates these relationships. Finally, we will explore the interaction of these community characteristics with race-ethnic composition on health care access and utilization of Blacks. Descriptive, bivariate, stratified analysis, and regression models, including multilevel models will be used to examine the relationship of each place characteristic with area-level healthcare resource availability and quality and with minority health care access and use. This project will continue the research program Why Place Matters to understand the role of place on health care disparities. A better understanding of the experiences of minorities living in complex environmental contexts, with varying mix of privileges or disadvantages, could inform the development of accurately targeted health communications or interventions. This project fits within sociocultural and healthcare system domains at both individual and community levels of influence of the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework. "
"9543745","Consortium for large-scale production and phenotyping of knockout mice (UM1) ABSTRACT: The long-term goal of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is to develop a resource of targeted mutations in mice for every protein-coding gene in the mammalian genome that the research community can use to elucidate gene function in human biology and disease. We have formed a consortium of two Institutes (Baylor College of Medicine and MRC Harwell). This application describes our plan to generate null alleles for 1500 mouse genes using CRISPR/RGN genome editing technology and validate each line using established QC procedures. We will cryopreserve all mutant strains and deliver germplasm to the MMRRC repositories. These mutant alleles represent a gold standard resource of mutant alleles for the wider community, and an important foundation for future research and translational studies using the mouse models created. We will perform broad-based adult phenotyping on all mutant lines, and for the first time incorporate an ageing component for a significant fraction of mutants, the latter involving an additional testing component from 12 months onwards. We will also assess homozygous lethal and subviable lines in an embryonic phenotyping pipeline, It is apparent that there is a relationship of mouse lethal (essential) and subviable genes with human disease loci. All allele and phenotype data will be submitted in real time to the Data Coordination Center, ensuring that all of the BasH data is disseminated to the wider biomedical scientific community. We will continue our R&D program to introduce appropriate methodological and technological developments from production to phenotyping. BasH will continue to pilot improvements in Cas9 RGN for the production of more sophisticated alleles, and in parallel ensure that developments in cryopreservation approaches at Baylor and Harwell are integrated into the production pipeline. We will also continue our major projects in improving and enriching the adult and embryo phenotyping pipelines, focusing on areas such as metabolomics, behavioral phenotyping and home cage monitoring, with the aim of providing more complex and longitudinal data. Baylor College of Medicine and MRC Harwell have the established expertise, experience, and resources to efficiently and cost-effectively meet this goal."
"9341817","Abstract: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a highly contagious viral disease caused by enteroviruses among infants and children. HFMD has recently emerged as a major public health concern and become an economic burden across the Asian-Pacific region, especially in China. For example, from 2008 to 2012, more than 9 million cases of HFMD were reported, resulting in around 2,700 reported deaths in China. Early, rapid and accurate identification of causative agents of HFMD is critical in the patient management and in the control of HFMD infection. Traditional virus confirmatory diagnosis methods are time-consuming and resource- intensive. Lateral flow immunochromatographic strip test is simple and instrument-free, but suffers from low sensitivity and specificity. PCR-based molecular diagnostics is both highly sensitive and specific for HFMD diagnosis. However, it requires expensive real-time PCR instruments, highly trained personnel, and labor- intensive operation, all of which are unsuitable for point-of-care (POC) use, in general, and unaffordable for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In collaboration with researchers in China, we propose to develop and validate a low cost, chemical-heating, mobile phone-based, molecular diagnostic device (dubbed ?smart cup?) for minimally-instrumented, on-site diagnosis of HFMD in rural China. We assemble a multidisciplinary research team and propose the following specific aims: i) develop and optimize the smart cup for HFMD molecular diagnosis, and ii) evaluate and validate the feasibility of the smart cup for clinical application at remote clinics in rural China. Our proposed smart cup is unique in: i) adapting a simple isothermal amplification strategy for rapid molecular diagnosis, ii) taking advantage of chemical exothermal reaction to produce the heating for isothermal amplification, eliminating the need for expensive electronic instruments, and iii) leveraging ubiquitous mobile phone technology to record, analyze and report the test results without the need for specialized optical detectors. With our international, interdisciplinary team, this project will promote technology transfer between UPenn and China, and strengthen the link with Chinese researchers and health care workers at remote clinics. The pilot-test data obtained in this project will be the basis for future larger- scale research on implementation and scale-up of our smart cup in rural areas. The innovation's benefits will not be limited to HFMD diagnosis; if successful, it will be easily adaptable to other pathogens (i.e., HPV, HIV)."
"9469350","PROJECT SUMMARY Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 1% of the adult world population, including 1.5 million adults in the U.S., and contributes significantly to the global burden of disease. There is currently no cure for RA, and available medications are often associated with risks of toxicity and adverse events. However, pregnancy is known to have remarkable disease modifying properties on RA, inducing a natural amelioration in 50-75% of patients, the mechanism(s) of which remain unknown. Our goal in this proposal is to gain an understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the natural amelioration of RA during pregnancy so that, in the long-term, novel therapy can be developed to mimic the beneficial effect of pregnancy on RA outside the context of pregnancy, to alleviate RA symptoms in both women and men. We hypothesize that the biological processes that lead to the natural improvement of RA during pregnancy are reflected in pregnancy-induced changes in gene expression at the systemic level. We previously established a unique prospective pregnancy cohort of RA and healthy women, with samples collected before, during and after pregnancy for gene expression studies. We now propose to examine changes in gene expression that occur during pregnancy in RA and healthy women in a larger sample of this cohort in order to gain an understanding of potential mechanism(s) whereby pregnancy naturally modulates disease activity in RA. The proposal is divided into 3 aims. In aim 1, a set of candidate genes with expression patterns that are associated with improvement in RA disease activity will be investigated. In aim 2, gene expression signatures associated with RA will be examined before pregnancy and the influence of pregnancy-induced expression changes on the RA signature will be investigated. In aim 3, pregnancy-induced gene expression patterns in RA and healthy women will be examined to provide insight into normal biological changes that occur during pregnancy, and how these may be altered in RA. In all 3 aims, potential epigenetic mechanisms that may be regulating expression during pregnancy will be investigated to provide insight into the natural amelioration of RA during pregnancy, and into why some women do not improve during pregnancy, but worsen. The proposed innovative approach includes a) a unique prospective pregnancy cohort which includes pre-pregnancy as baseline, b) a successful recruitment approach, c) a powerful longitudinal study design, d) state-of-the-art RNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics methods to assess gene expression, e) powerful statistical analysis approaches, and f) epigenetic studies to examine regulation of candidate gene expression. Such investigations using the proposed approach are novel in the context of both normal and RA pregnancies. There is a high potential that the findings can lead to identification of novel drug targets for improved RA therapy without side effects of current medications, and novel biomarkers of RA disease activity."
"9446039","ABSTRACT The prevalence of low back pain (LBP) among U.S. adults is estimated at 20%, with 50-80% of people reporting a significant episode at some point in their life, and 23% of LBP patients reporting pain of high intensity with disability. The greatest burden placed on society occurs when LBP becomes chronic (cLBP). Inadequately managed chronic pain results in greater loss of productivity; increased expenditures for hospitalization, surgery and medications; and costly out-of-pocket patient expenses. Given their high rates of musculoskeletal disease, cLBP-related disability is rampant within our nation's Veteran population. The combination of cLBP and high medication use negatively impacts Veterans' work productivity and quality of life, and generates substantial risk for long-term disability and opioid addiction. There is arguably no more important population than Veterans for performing research to evaluate effective non-pharmacological treatments that are safe, pain relieving, cost-effective, and contain promise to restore function and quality of life. One such option is chiropractic care. Several key factors support the need to deepen the study of chiropractic care within the Veteran population: 1) biological models offer strong support for plausibility; 2) sufficient strength of evidence in systematic reviews has garnered a recommendation by American College of Physicians for spinal manipulation and/or chiropractic care targeting cLBP, and 3) since beginning in 2004, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) has successfully integrated 115 doctors of chiropractic into ambulatory care settings. These advances in chiropractic care integration have occurred despite substantial knowledge gaps, particularly within VA. Specifically, studies examining the delivery of chiropractic interventions have been highly variable and there is no optimal ?dosing? in terms of treatment duration or number of visits. Thus, the proposed study of Veterans age 18 and older with a diagnosis of cLBP is highly significant. Demonstration project investigators will work closely with the NIH-DOD-VA Collaboratory to accomplish the following project Aims: 1) Plan and develop the pragmatic research infrastructure needed to deliver a rigorous, multi-site, randomized controlled trial within the VA addressing 15 milestones in four categories of activities; 2) Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a low dose (1-5 visits) of standard chiropractic care against a higher dose (8- 12 visits) in Veterans with cLBP; 3) Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of chiropractic chronic pain management (CCPM) compared to usual care, following the initial treatment described in Aim 1; 4) Evaluate the impact of CCPM on health services outcomes, compared to usual care; 5) Evaluate patient and clinician perceptions of non-specific treatment factors, effectiveness of study interventions, and impact of the varying doses of standard chiropractic care and the CCPM on clinical outcomes across 3 VA facilities using a mixed method, process evaluation approach."
"9383488","PROJECT SUMMARY Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo continuous fission and fusion. Mitochondrial dynamics are essential for cell survival, as well as for mitochondrial quality control, transport, distribution and inheritance. Defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in various neurological disorders including Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s and Huntington?s diseases, as well as in cardiovascular disease and cancer. The molecular mechanisms that accomplish mitochondrial membrane fission and fusion are poorly understood, as are the roles of the molecules involved in these processes. The long-term goal of this proposal is to address such issues. The mechanoenzymatic GTPase, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is the master regulator of mitochondrial fission. Cytosolic Drp1 initiates mitochondrial fission via interactions with adaptor proteins, Mff, MiD49/51, or Fis1 localized at the mitochondrial surface. Subsequent Drp1 polymerization as ?helical scaffolds? around pre-destined mitochondrial division sites and GTP hydrolysis-driven scaffold constriction catalyzes mitochondrial fission. Exciting new studies have also necessitated a cooperative role for direct Drp1-phospholipid interactions, specifically with the mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin (CL), in mitochondrial fission. However, very little is known about the cooperativity of Drp1-adaptor and Drp1-CL interactions, either in space or in time, during this process. Several unknown fundamental issues essential for understanding Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission will be addressed in this application. These include 1) the mechanisms underlying Drp1 CL recognition, and the identity of Drp1 residues involved in specific phospholipid interactions, 2) the mechanism of the Drp1 variable domain (VD) in CL reorganization and nonbilayer phase transition, 3) the domain-specific topography of Drp1 on the membrane surface and conformational rearrangements that ensue upon specific adaptor and CL interactions, and 4) the cooperativity of CL and adaptor interactions in effecting mitochondrial fission. The proposed experiments will test the overarching hypothesis that cooperative Drp1 interactions with protein adaptors and CL promote the formation of a productive ?fission complex? that is localized in CL-rich micro-environments and drives membrane remodeling and fission through a Drp1 GTP hydrolysis-dependent CL bilayer-to-nonbilayer phase transition mechanism. We will use a tailor-made array of innovative fluorescence spectroscopic and microscopic approaches, coupled to solution and solid state NMR, to address these issues. These include the use of a novel variation of the FRET approach to determine domain-specific Drp1-membrane distances, collisional quenching of fluorescence to determine and measure Drp1 VD membrane insertion, and fluorescence imaging on model GUVs to visualize adaptor- and CL-regulated, Drp1-mediated membrane remodeling and fission. Successful outcomes of this research will provide (i) a fundamentally improved understanding of the cooperative molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial fission, and (ii) a molecular foundation for the design of drugs and therapeutics that can beneficially modulate mitochondrial dynamics under various disease states."

"9397976","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Upper extremity hemiparesis has a profound and lasting negative impact on quality of life and independence in activities of daily living for stoke survivors, yet, despite many investigations, there are no gold standard treatments in current clinical practice. We have carried out a progressive research program that has demonstrated the effectiveness of robotic therapy in chronic stroke patients, and then optimizing the type of robotic therapy and associated therapy that these patients receive. But gains in the chronic group are modest on average, and despite an intuition that earlier intervention will be beneficial, there is little data to confirm that. Therefore, we propose to build upon our expertise with robot-assisted training for chronic stroke impairment in order to evaluate the potential of predictive models that would select patients with better chances of making functional gains. Our clinical hypothesis is that kinematic and physiological biomarkers of recovery potential exist, and include baseline motor ability in both functional tasks and in the robotic environment, and measures of corticospinal tract effectiveness determined by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Functional and anatomical measures of connectivity, and plasticity relevant genotype are secondary biomarkers to test. Time after stroke is another promising marker to test, with strong implications for clinical practice. We also propose a secondary mechanistic hypothesis that maladaptive transhemispheric cortical inhibition will be altered by the intervention. Specific Objectives: Create a predictive model of function and disability following the intervention. Measure the effects of 12 weeks of robot-assisted therapy and transition to task training at > 6 months after stroke. Create a model that predicts clinically meaningful change in Fugl-Meyer in response to the intervention and test the validity of the model. Determine the effect our hybrid method of training has on interhemispheric inhibition by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to study silent period and recruitment curve. Patients with moderate to severe arm dysfunction (based on Fugl-Meyer scores of 7 to 45) of >6 months duration who are medically stable and do not have contractures or other impairments that would interfere with training will be enrolled. 96 subjects will be assigned to a single study arm with a multiple baseline approach to ensure stability of measures. Evaluations will be conducted by an examiner who has no knowledge of the predictive model. The first four weeks of training will consist of wrist robot training sessions, te second four weeks will consist of planar robot training sessions and the third four weeks will consist of alternation wrist and planar training sessions. Robot training sessions will be 45 minutes in duration followed by 15 minutes of training on functionally relevant tasks (translation to task training (TTT)). Clinical evaluations will include Stroke Impact Scale (Primary Outcome), Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Performance Section Test, Wolf Motor Function Test, Action Research Arm Test, and activity monitor of home arm use. Kinematic analysis will be conducted pre and post training. A majority of patients will be consented for TMS and MRI. In those subjects intrahemispheric inhibition will be determined at each outcomes measurement visit. MRI will be performed only at the baseline period, and will be used to define the lesion type, white matter integrity and functional connectivity of the corticospinal tract. At the conclusion of these aims we will have a method for clinical decision-making regarding intensive arm therapy late after stroke, and a better mechanistic understanding of how it works. The method will be disseminated throughout the VA medical system and beyond."

"9434650","Project Summary/Abstract Nearly 300,000 Americans have sustained some form of spinal cord injury (SCI), and effective therapies to promote recovery of neural function are lacking. Our overarching vision is to create an ex-vivo tissue that can replace the damaged spinal cord and enable formation of new relay circuits across sites of even severe injury. Our extensive rodent work with 3D printed biomimetic scaffolds shows that this approach can result in electrophysiological and functional recovery after complete spinal cord transection, the most severe model of spinal cord injury. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of scaling up a 3D printed biomimetic scaffold, loaded with human neural stem cells, to a clinically relevant, non-human primate model of spinal cord contusion. There are 3 objectives to this project:  1. Image the primate contusion-lesioned spinal cord by MRI scan.  2. Generate a 3D model and print individual scaffolds that conform to each subject's injury.  3. Implant 2 subjects with scaffolds: 1 Empty scaffold, 1 scaffold loaded with human neural  stem cells. A demonstration of feasibility will lead to an R01 application in the non-human primate, with potential clinical translation."
"9405969","ABSTRACT  Project 6 Project VI of the Florida LDRC, titled Imaging genetics in SRD: Mega- and meta-analyses, is designed in response to the RFA-HD-17-006's stipulation to obtain converging evidence through the utilization of multiple methodologies?neuroimaging and genetic in the case of Project VI?in order to both discover and highlight the most robust and replicable facets of the genome-brain connection in Specific Reading Disabilities (SRD). Project VI is contextualized by the overall premise of the P50 to reflect on the status of science in the field of learning disabilities (LD) in general and SRD in particular and, therefore, is framed to generate such a reflection in the subfield of imaging genetics of SRD. With that in mind, we propose a set of imaging-genetic meta-analytic studies. Specifically, we are proposing to establish a merged data set that combines behavior, neuroimaging, and genetic (GWAS) data generated by a group of USA and European investigators. Specific Aim 1 (SA1) of Project VI is committed to the construction of such a database; it establishes the procedures for data merging, quality control, deposition, and manipulation. At the time of submission, we have a firm commitment from contributing investigators to generate a dataset of 1,202 individuals. We have secured three more tentative commitments that have the potential to substantially increase the dataset. Moreover, we have a set of additional investigators who have expressed interest, but with whom we have not yet followed up to appraise the general compatibility of both the brain and genetic data (i.e., the recruitment, collection, and analyses parameters). SA2 is a continuation and extension of the activities of Project VI over two previous cycles of funding. This aim will provide an opportunity to interrogate the genetic findings assembled in Project VI so far for their robustness, replicability, and generalizability using these merged data. Thus, SA2 assures the continuity of the work carried out by Project VI throughout the two generations of the Florida LDRC. In contrast, SA3 is exploratory and innovative, both to the field of SRD and to Project VI. It proposes a reversed GWAS (or set of GWASes) that capitalizes on the availability of multiple neuroimaging phenotypes in the large merged dataset that we will assemble in SA1. Importantly, to maintain the spirit and the scope of the proposed work, we will utilize behavioral data only for the purpose of grouping or controlling for level of performance in SA2 and SA3. In summary, this iteration of Project VI corresponds to the general theme of the third-generation Florida LDRC: it capitalizes on its own trajectory developed throughout the two previous cycles of funding, proposes a set of mega- and meta-analytic studies, and creates an opportunity to utilize and further develop a curated communal resource that has the potential to become a platform for reproducibility tests in the field of SRD."

"9482097","PROJECT SUMMARY: HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) persists despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), in a mechanism likely involves myeloid cell activation. More reliable biomarkers and a better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving HAND are needed to limit or halt the trajectory of this disorder. Recent advances in glycobiology have shown that glycan-lectin signaling plays critical roles in establishing several immune responses, including myeloid activation, and that glycan defects can underlie some neurological disorders. We asked whether an altered glycome might underlie HAND during ART. Using cutting-edge glycomic technologies, we found that plasma levels of a particular class of N-linked oligosaccharides ? un-sialylated ?(1,4) Gal GlcNAc (USG) ? were higher in HIV+ individuals on ART with cognitive impairment when compared to the un-impaired group. Further, greater levels of USG were associated with greater neurological impairment. Our group also has shown that plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs), key players in the body?s complex network of intercellular signaling, exert a pro-inflammatory effect on monocytes. The glycosylation features of EVs have been shown as a critical component to their functional activities. Together our data support the hypothesis that certain classes of circulating glycans may contribute to the pathogenesis and/or serve as biomarkers of HIV-associated cognitive impairment. We plan to investigate the role of cell-free glycans in the pathogenesis of HAND by leveraging a well-characterized clinical cohort of HIV+ individuals on ART with extensive clinical data, documented neuropsychological performance assessments, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. In Aim 1, we will assess the levels of circulating, cell-free glycans and EV-bound glycans in HIV+ individuals on suppressive ART, and define the relationship between these glycomic profiles and the degree of neurocognitive impairment in these individuals. An advanced high- density lectin microarray platform will be used to profile 96 different cell-free glycan structures in the plasma, and on purified EVs from these individuals. Glycan structures will be compared across the cognitive impairment spectrum defined through clinical diagnosis status, neuropsychological test performance scores, neuroinflammatory plasma measures, and MRI (brain metabolites and volumes). In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of cell-free glycan-lectin and EV-bound glycan-lectin interactions on peripheral monocyte activation and migration. Primary monocytes will be either enzymatically deglycosylated, depleting un-sialylated N-linked oligosaccharides, or treated with a specific carbohydrate-binding protein specific to it. Cells will then be exposed to EVs derived from impaired, or unimpaired HIV+ donors and effects will be measured on monocyte activation and migration. Our study will utilize the advent of new glycan-based technologies that can be harnessed to inform on mechanisms of HAND that may afford new diagnostics and/or treatment options for ameliorating cognitive impairment in this vulnerable population."
"9459621","PROJECT SUMMARY Transplantation of insulin-secreting beta cells is an effective therapy for Type 1 diabetes (T1D). To secure supplies of these therapeutic cells, many research groups are actively optimizing protocols to derive insulin+ cells by differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or by reprogramming of adult tissues. The next major challenge is to discover methods to protect transplanted cells from autoimmunity to achieve long-term glycemic control. Clinical observations have long suggested existence of beta cells in T1D patients that escape autoimmunity and continue to function. Such cells are very challenging to study from clinical samples. New research tools are needed to address the critical question of how to produce insulin-secreting cells that resist autoimmunity. Our laboratory recently discovered that insulin-secreting cells can be readily produced from murine gastric tissues using a direct reprogramming approach with defined genetic factors Ngn3, Pdx1, and Mafa (referred to as NPM factors). The gastric-derived insulin+ cells share key molecular and functional features of pancreatic beta cells but are not identical to native beta cells. We transplanted gastric insulin+ cells into the NOD murine model of T1D and made the surprising observation that gastric insulin+ cells, unlike native pancreatic beta cells, are not subject to strong immune attack, suggesting reduced immunogenic properties. This observation raised the exciting possibility that gastric-derived insulin+ cells could be employed as a novel tool to study immune-beta cell interactions in human T1D and may be further developed into a transplantation therapy that requires minimal immune protection. In this proposal, we will develop new methods to produce functional insulin-secreting cells from human gastric tissues using two separate approaches and study their immunogenic properties with a variety of tools including human T1D- derived T-cell clones. Our ultimate goal is to gain mechanistic insight into the immune response to beta cells in T1D and to discover novel pathways that may diminish or prevent the autoimmune attack. If successful, this project will also lay the foundation for a novel source of insulin-secreting cells for therapeutic transplantation to treat T1D."

The long-term objective of TL1-supported programs within the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS) is to train tomorrow's workforce of team-based, translational biomedical researchers at predoctoral levels. Three Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Recruit a diverse group of students at multiple career levels and integrate learning across these learner groups through a variety of programs. 2) Implement learning strategies for these students using novel curricula based on the R4 approach (the Right education at the Right time to the Right learner with the Right method), using novel approaches including case-based learning; team-based learning; task-oriented learning; and immersion in internships within industry, regulatory agencies, start-ups, and organizations that succeed through teamwork. 3) Rigorously evaluate outcomes and disseminate successful models, so that these novel programs can be continuously improved and the CTSA Consortium and others can benefit from these experiences. Ten slots are requested to support 3 different experiences: 1) The PhD Program in Clinical and Translational Science, an innovative PhD track developed de novo to accelerate the education of leaders in translational team research; 2) the Master's Degree in Clinical and Translational Science for medical students to prepare future physicians for careers in clinical and translational science; 3) short-term medical school research experiences to introduce students to the clinical and translational research process, and to motivate them to pursue further research training. An extensive framework for the TL1 Core that emphasizes diversity has been successfully built over the last 9 years. We will build upon this considerable experience, retaining those elements of proven benefit and implementing enhancements in the next funding cycle. Highlights of these enhancements include expanded training opportunities in team science, entrepreneurship, and the science of Translation and Regulatory Science; expanded opportunities for experiential learning on the Mayo campus, in partner institutions, and in novel extramural environments; enhanced ability to tailor didactic curricula to individual needs; and increased leveraging of institutional strengths in growth areas within the institution. Established collaborations with partner institutions, including the University of Minnesota CTSI and the University of Puerto Rico, will be strengthened, and rigorous evaluation systems that use innovative and comprehensive metrics to track individual and program progress and outcomes will be developed further.

"9409030","Summary Approximately 1.5 million women in the United States are at high-risk for developing breast cancer, based on inheritance of a germline mutation in a gene in the double strand-break (DSB) repair and cyclin-checkpoint pathways. Many are unaware of their genetic predispositions, because their family history is uninformative or unknown. Genetic testing is important for identifying mutations in these genes, but in ~75% of cases no mutation or a variant of uncertain significance will be identified, leading to ambiguous, unsatisfactory results. Identifying women at high risk prior to the onset of disease is an important challenge for personalized medicine, because disease can be prevented or treated at the earliest stage when cure is more likely. As more women are seeking genetic testing to identify their risk of breast cancer, accurate alternatives to sequencing are needed to predict the molecular phenotypic effects of mutations in genes in breast cancer-predisposing pathways. Risk classification scores based on flow variant assays (FVAs) are a new technology that can accurately identify women with heterozygous germline mutations in these pathways. In response to treatment with radiomimetic chemicals, FVAs identify decreased nuclear localization of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins and decreased phosphorylation of p53 in cells that bear mutations in these genes. FVAs are rapid, inexpensive and highly reproducible and can be performed on circulating and cultured human blood cells, thus lending themselves to becoming a Next Generation, non-sequencing, standalone test for assessing cancer risks. The goal of this STTR project is to develop a, simple, rapid and inexpensive clinical test that will accurately identify those at high risk for breast cancers. Phase I hypothesis. The standalone FVA test using whole blood samples will identify those at high-risk with 95% accuracy. Specific aim 1. Achieve risk classification score results for 99% of subjects with at least 95% accuracy on 180 subjects from well-characterized risk groups. Specific Aim 2. Achieve risk classification score results for all subjects from Aim 1 with comparable accuracy using an automated analysis protocol and newly created commercial kit. Having demonstrated analytical validity in Phase I, MMG will demonstrate clinical utility in Phase II by calculating and validating 10-year hazard ratios for breast cancer by age decade for 1,800 women followed by up to 20 years by the NCI's Breast Cancer Family Registry. This product will be sold to clinical laboratories in collaboration with a designated good manufacturing practices facility commercial partner, initially as a laboratory developed test and then as an FDA approved test. Several factors will drive this commercialization into the $1B market cancer risk assessment market: 1. low entry and performance costs, 2. greater accuracy than sequencing, 3. application to understanding risks for ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers, and 4. companion diagnostic for the new class of targeted chemotherapy, called ?PARP inhibitors.? The creation of simplified, commercial FVA kits will be a game changer for assessing cancer risks."
"9563684","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this advanced predoctoral training program in Neuroscience is to produce graduate students with a high level understanding of the theory, practice, and clinical importance of neural dynamics. Students with appropriate background coursework and research interests will be enrolled in this advanced training plan, a subset of 4 students will receive direct funding from this training grant. Deep knowledge of the basic mechanisms underlying neural dynamics is crucial to understand healthy behavior and many of the profound deficits observed in neurological disease. This topic spans almost all levels of neuroscience inquiry: Biophysics determines patterns of action potential firing, which in turn determines the probability of relay between neurons, and ultimately the information that a neural circuit or distributed representation can carry. Brown University has strong expertise across all these levels, ranging from the genetic bases of neural dynamics underlying behavior through the cognitive neuroscientific study of dynamic control of information processing based on high-level goals. Failures in neural dynamics are widely hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of maladies such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. The directors, Diane Lipscombe and Chris Moore, have complementary expertise ideal for an Advanced Training Plan in neural dynamics. They will receive advice from external and internal advisory groups and from students, to continue to adapt and improve the training plan. The Neural Dynamics training program will be managed and administered within Brown's Graduate Program in Neuroscience. The Neuroscience Graduate program at Brown offers student-centered, high-quality training and the majority of our graduates pursue careers in neuroscience. Students are also exposed to computational, translational, and clinical approaches. Early multi-disciplinary training dovetails well with this specialized advanced training in Neural Dynamics. This Training Program will provide three basic requirements to produce students with strong training in Neural Dynamics: First, a detailed understanding of the state of knowledge and the defining debates in the study of neural dynamics is required, and will be imparted to students in lectures and seminar courses. This training in basic knowledge will be paired with intensive training in experimental practice to teach students basic principles of scientific design of dynamics studies, and in the cutting edge methods used to resolve debates and test hypotheses in the study of neural dynamics. Students will also design their own experiment(s) on a topic in neural dynamics, and then execute these studies in an intensive 9-day practicum at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). Second, a world-class environment of 29 laboratories investigating this topic at Brown is crucial to foster long-term, in-depth predoctoral research on this topic. Third, access to perspectives beyond those of the home institution, and most importantly beyond classical academia itself, will expand students' understanding and perspective on this important topic."
"9567684","Cancer Control and Population Health ? Project Summary The Cancer Control and Population Health (CCPH) research program in The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers focused on: 1) identifying new strategies to improve smoking cessation and enhance the capability of clinical systems to deliver proven smoking cessation services; and 2) advancing the science of translating cancer control into communities and clinical practice, with a particular emphasis on addressing the needs of the KUCC catchment area. The 35 members of the CCPH program come from 14 departments in six schools across four campuses. These members represent a rich mix of expertise, including psychologists, sociologists, neuroscientists, primary care physicians, oncologists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, anthropologists, economists, pharmacists, communication specialists and health services researchers. Program members are supported by $13.4M in total annual funds, including $3.6M from the National Cancer Institute. CCPH members have published 341 articles since 2012 of which 111 (33%) had intra-programmatic, 69 (20%) had inter-programmatic and 243 (71%) had inter-institutional collaborations. Since the creation of CCPH, program members have made remarkable progress in developing the infrastructure to conduct cancer control research in our region among underserved, rural, American Indian, African American and Latino communities. With this infrastructure in place, in 2015 CCPH members enrolled 1,929 people, including those from underserved communities in the KUCC catchment area, into cancer control research studies. Specifically, 1,603 to interventional research studies. Paralleling this growth in infrastructure has been a significant growth in cancer control funding, program membership and scholarly productivity. CCPH program activities support both intra- and inter-programmatic interactions through translational research seminars, a visiting scholars program, research symposia and research working groups. A strong mentoring program has helped junior faculty procure training grants and minority supplements. CCPH research efforts have led to a better understanding of the cancer control needs in the KUCC catchment area, improved capacity to analyze the needs of affected and at-risk populations, better strategies for the design and delivery of cancer control messages and improvements in the delivery of tobacco control, cancer screening, physical activity and obesity treatment programs at the level of both the clinical practice and the community at large."

"9552330","The paroxysmal dyskinesias are an important category of movement disorders characterized by the sudden onset of involuntary movements that may include one or more of the following: dystonia, chorea, athetosis and ballism. The paroxysmal dyskinesias are divided into three major types: PKD (paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias), PNKD (paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesias), and paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesias (PED). Precipitating factors are included within the name of each type: kinesigenic (sudden movements), non-kinesigenic (triggered by stress or alcohol), and exertion- or exercise-induced. The paroxysmal dyskinesias may be familial (hereditary), sporadic, or secondary to other neurological or metabolic disorder. The paroxysmal dyskinesias show overlap with other paroxysmal neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy, migraines) in terms of genetics and triggers. Overall, dystonia is the foremost involuntary movement manifest by patients with PKD, PNKD and PED, and PKD due to mutations in PRRT2 is the most common cause of hereditary paroxysmal dystonia.  Conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse models of PKD (Prrt2) offer the distinct possibility of exposing the functional network pathobiology of dystonia and paroxysmal disorders given the high penetrance of PRRT2 mutations in humans and robust phenotypes seen in our Prrt2 mouse models. Moreover, paroxysmal neurological disorders are ideal model systems for studying neural function by allowing for direct comparisons of ictal and inter-ictal states. Our major objectives are to define the neuroanatomical substrates of dystonia using mouse models of PKD and identify the in vivo and in vitro neurophysiological abnormalities that drive dystonia. We will detail the anatomical distribution of Prrt2/PRRT2 and ultrastructural localization of PRRT2, examine the effects of simple KO using a collection of behavioral and morphological assessments, determine if the neuroanatomical origin of dystonia and/or other paroxysmal dyskinesias can be narrowed down to specific brain regions (e.g., cerebellum) and neuronal populations (e.g., cerebellar granule cells, Purkinje cells or deep cerebellar neurons), and examine neural networks activated by paroxysmal dystonia. Neurophysiological studies will be used to characterize the synaptic function of PRRT2 and the signature cellular and network neurophysiological abnormalities the generate dystonic posturing. Our proposed experiments will answer fundamental questions related to the pathogenesis of dystonia, paroxysmal disorders of the nervous system, and biology of PRRT2."

"9483500","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this study is to test a transdisciplinary ecological approach to reducing mental health disparities among Mexican immigrants by adapting and integrating a multilevel community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention (Immigrant Well-being Project, IWP) into existing efforts at three community partner organizations that focus on mental health, education, legal, and civil rights issues for Mexican immigrants. This research is innovative and significant because it employs cutting edge strategies to address social-structural determinants of mental health and examines the community-engaged process of adapting and testing the impact of a multilevel intervention originally designed for refugees. The IWP intervention emphasizes a sustainable and replicable partnership model between community-based organizations and universities that involves Mexican immigrants and undergraduate advocates working together to: a) increase immigrants? abilities to navigate their communities; b) improve immigrants' access to community resources; c) enhance meaningful social roles by valuing immigrants' culture, experiences, and knowledge; d) reduce immigrants' social isolation; and e) increase communities? responsiveness to immigrants through changes in policy and practice. The IWP is administered by university students enrolled in a service learning course, and has two elements: 1) Learning Circles, which involve cultural exchange and one-on-one learning opportunities, and; 2) Advocacy, which involves collaborative efforts to mobilize community resources related to health, housing, employment, education, and legal issues. Studies of the intervention model with refugees demonstrated feasibility, appropriateness, acceptability, and evidence that the intervention decreased participants? psychological distress and increased protective factors, and impacted changes in system-wide policies and practices. After completing in-depth ethnographic interviews with 24 Mexican immigrant adults to elucidate their mental health needs, stressors, current political/economic/social context, and local solutions, and a process of community engagement and intervention adaptation, a mixed methods strategy with data collected from 90 participants at four time points over a period of 14 months will be used to test the impact of the 6- month intervention on reducing psychological distress, increasing protective factors (access to resources, English proficiency, environmental mastery, and social support), and achieving system-level changes in organizational, local, and state policies and practices that impact Mexican immigrants? well-being. Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored by testing mediating relationships between protective factors and psychological distress. Qualitative data will explore feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, participants? experiences in the intervention, and unexpected impacts; document multilevel changes and the context of implementation at each site; and inform interpretation of quantitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data on the quality of the CBPR partnerships and their relationship to multilevel outcomes will also be examined."
"9494407","DESCRIPTION:        For the first time in history, people with a lower limb amputation have regained normative function during level-ground walking due to the development of a new powered ankle-foot prosthesis. However, negotiating natural and built environments also requires the ability to walk and run on uphill and downhill slopes. Thus, an ankle-foot prosthesis must be able to accomodate changes in velocity and slope to allow Veterans with a leg amputation to achieve full functional equivalence during locomotion.  The proposed Career Development Award aims to characterize biological ankle joint function during walking and running on slopes in order to further develop advanced powered ankle-foot prostheses. Ankle joint torque and angle data will be collected from 20 non-amputees while walking and running at multiple velocities (1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 m/s) on level, uphill, and downhill slopes (0?, +/-3?, +/-6?, and +/-9?). This biological ankle joint data will be used to develop prosthetic ankle joint control parameters for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis at each velocity and slope combination. Then, these parameters will be implemented and tested in the powered prosthesis.  Ankle joint torque and angle, muscle activity, and metabolic cost data will be collected from 10 people with a unilateral transtibial amputation using the powered prosthesis while walking and running at the above- mentioned velocity and slope combinations. This data will be compared to that of non-amputees to determine if a powered prosthesis is capable of emulating a biological ankle joint. It is predicted that if biologically- equivalent mechanical power, compliance, and range of motion are supplied by the prosthetic ankle joint, people with a lower limb amputation will achieve equivalent biomechanics, muscle activity, and metabolic energy costs compared to non-amputees. The data from the proposed CDA-2 will be highly valuable for use in the design of prostheses, and also in the design of orthoses and other assistive devices.  With the increasing number of Veterans with leg amputations, there is a heightened demand for advanced prostheses. The proposed research and development of a state-of-the-art powered prosthesis specifically aims to give people with a lower limb amputation the ability to walk and run over a full range of velocities on level-ground, uphill, and downhill slopes.  I am committed to improving Veterans' rehabilitation and healthcare through ongoing research, development, and analysis of assistive mechanical devices. My previous research experience, in the areas of human biomechanics, physiology, and mechatronics, and my CDA-1, entitled the Effects of wearing a powered ankle-foot prosthesis on amputee walking, have addressed questions directly related to the proposed research. The current proposal, to comprehensively study uphill and downhill locomotion, has specific relevance to Veterans because advanced mechanical devices promise to significantly improve function and indirectly improve quality of life.  I plan to continue pursung my research career and aspire to become an independent investigator within the Department of Veterans Affairs Research Rehabilitation and Development Service. To further my career aspirations, I have proposed professional goals to expand my scientific research skills and knowledge, knowledge of musculoskeletal modeling and control systems techniques, and clinical knowledge and application of prosthetic devices. I also bring together mentors, consultants, and collaborators with extensive expertise in prosthesis design and development, rehabilitation, computer modeling and simulation, and the biomechanics and energetics of human locomotion; areas that will contribute significantly toward my career development and toward the goals of my research. I am very excited about the proposed project and look forward to this important work."
"9565183","Abstract/Project Summary Severe skeletal muscle trauma resulting from ischemic damage, nerve transection injuries, or volumetric defects is an intractable problem. Dysfunction and disability owing to the latter are an increasingly significant clinical burden. To address this challenge, this proposal seeks to develop biomaterial delivery systems that regulate the micro-environmental factors that harness the pro-regenerative functions of recruited blood monocytes to enhance volumetric muscle healing outcomes. In a pre-clinical model of volumetric muscle loss, we have shown that delivery of immune modulatory small molecules targeted to bioactive lipid receptors increases wound repair macrophages within the injury niche and enhances repair mechanisms such as angiogenesis, matrix deposition, and muscle fiber regrowth. The overall hypothesis for the proposed research is that local pharmacological targeting of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors uniquely recruits Ly6Clo monocytes directly from blood to the injury niche where they serve as biased progenitors of wound healing macrophages within injured muscle. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: To characterize inflammatory infiltrate into the murine spinotrapezius volumetric muscle loss model and immune cell interactions with muscle satellite cells; Aim 2: To assess the impact of local delivery of S1P receptor targeted small molecules from polymer scaffolds on myeloid cell accumulation and behavior after skeletal muscle injury; Aim 3: To evaluate functional outcomes within a critical-sized volumetric defect in the murine quadriceps in response to local delivery of S1P receptor targeted small molecules. As the sequelae of muscle injuries increases at a disproportionate rate with advancing age, the burden of muscle injury on an aging domestic population will be increasingly severe. Thud, mechanisms surrounding the healing of volumetric muscle defects must be elucidated in order to advance translational therapeutics."
"9457105","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Psychosis typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood, during a vital stage in social and cognitive development, which can have a profoundly adverse impact on an individual?s long-term functioning. Numerous studies find a substantial delay between the onset of psychosis and the initiation of specialty treatment for first episode psychosis (FEP), with the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) typically over one year in the U.S. Better detection strategies are needed to improve identification of individuals with FEP and to rapidly engage them in Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) aimed at restoring functioning. The onset of psychosis is preceded by a prodromal phase characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms and decline in functioning. This phase (at-risk mental state: ARMS) is a potential target for strategies aimed at improving outcome by reducing DUP through regular symptom monitoring. This study will investigate whether a U.S. adaptation of a successful detection approach from the Netherlands can reduce DUP in the U.S. setting. The Dutch study found that screening of a consecutive help-seeking population entering mental health services captures significantly more FEP and ARMS cases than clinician referrals from mental health centers. Therefore screening may be an effective strategy for identifying individuals with psychotic symptoms earlier on in the course of their illness. This study will implement and evaluate a systematic screening for psychotic symptoms in community mental health clinics in order to facilitate rapid identification and engagement in treatment of individuals with FEP. Individuals ages 12 to 30 entering child/adolescent and adult community mental health clinics (CMHCs) within Mount Sinai Health System will be screened with the 16-item Version of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ-16). Those who screen positive will be assessed by Comprehensive Assessment of at-Risk Mental State (CAARMS) and referred to stage-specific specialty care. Individuals with FEP will be referred to CSC programs: OnTrackNY and PEER. Individuals with ARMS will be monitored and referred to ICanFeelBetter program for ARMS. DUP will be measured for all individuals who meet CAARMS psychosis criteria. We hypothesize that screening for psychotic symptoms in CMHCs will be feasible and acceptable, and that the average DUP of FEP individuals identified with screening will be less than 3 months, the maximum time between onset of psychotic symptoms and engagement in CSC recommended by the World Health Organization. In order to optimize screening and treatment engagement strategies for reducing DUP, we will identify facilitators and barriers to FEP care through in-depth qualitative interviews with patients and caregivers, and by mapping pathways to FEP care. We will also conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with clinicians to explore their experience with the screening and referral process. Findings from this project will inform a fully powered, controlled study to evaluate whether this screening method, compared to traditional referral, leads to more timely identification of FEP cases earlier in the course of illness."
"9435745","Delay in treatment initiation contributes to higher mortality among Black women despite lower incidence of breast cancer (BrCa) among Black compared to White women. Survival studies show that a delay of two months has been linked with a less favorable survival among BrCa cases. The use of Adjuvant Hormonal Therapy (AHT) has been shown to improve both short- and long-term survival among Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+) BrCa patients worldwide as it reduces BrCa mortality and reoccurrence. The advantages of AHT notwithstanding, 10-30% of eligible BrCa patients never start treatment with AHT and many who start AHT never complete the treatment leading to reoccurrence and increased mortality. This lack of initial uptake and adherence to AHT is worse among Blacks compared to Whites. Effective reduction of disparities in treatment delays and mortality among racial minorities will require the identification of the mechanisms by which disparities occur particularly, studying neighborhood-level factors that have been shown to affect the odds of receipt of BrCa treatments among Black women. For this application, I propose to assess racial disparities in BrCa treatment and mortality in South Carolina (SC) utilizing data that was derived from all female BrCa cases over eight years from the SC Central Cancer Registry linked with administrative medical and pharmacy claims data for both publicly insured and privately insured BrCa patients. I will assess the complex interplay between 1) geographic factors, 2) racial disparities 3) Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping, 4) survival methods and 5) multi-level models to identify predictors of treatment delays and mortality that can be intervened upon. GIS methods have not been utilized to specifically identify individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics that may contribute to BrCa mortality among blacks within the context of multilevel survival modelling; this has the potential to allow for the application of evidence-based approaches to reduce disparities. This project has 3 aims: 1) to assess racial disparities in treatment delays and the utilization of AHT among patients diagnosed with breast cancer (Pre-Doctoral and completed); 2) to identify predictors of dissimilarity in breast cancer related survival by health regions among Black women in SC utilizing multilevel survival models and GIS methodologies (Pre-Doctoral and yet to be completed); 3) to assess if neighborhood-level factors modify the effect of patient navigation on uptake of initial recommended breast cancer care and time to diagnostic resolution among minority populations (Post-Doctoral direction). The F99 phase of this fellowship award will provide the necessary training and mentoring to further my knowledge and skill in 1) disparities, 2) survival, 3) multi-level, 4) GIS, and 5) geospatial analyses. The K00 phase will expose me to 1) interventional analyses such as cancer patient navigation, 2) Randomized Controlled Trials and 3) enhance my scholarly productivity and professional development during this fellowship, including preparation and submission of grants and publications."
"9410034","Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently emerged as a revolution in cancer care, providing the potential for durable response and improved survival for numerous cancer patients across multiple cancer types. However, only 10-20% of patients who are treated with checkpoint inhibitors have responded in most cancer types, necessitating biomarker assays that can reliably and accurately identify those patients likely to respond. Recent, compelling evidence supports the clinical utility of microsatellite instability (MSI) as a predictive marker of immunotherapy response, reaching overall survival rates of >64% versus 11% in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. MSI-high tumors are histopathologically distinct from their MSS counterparts, displaying a marked influx of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and express high levels of immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1. This unique immune microenvironment supports the hypothesis that MSI-high tumors more susceptible to immunotherapies, and has been proposed as a biomarker for stratifying patient populations. Supporting this notion, The FDA just granted priority review for a supplemental application of Keytruda (a PD-1 inhibitor) in previously treated MSI-H tumors on the basis of 5 open-label Phase I/II trials across multiple tumor types. Current MSI screening is conducted on tumor biopsies using variable, non- standardized PCR-based and IHC laboratory developed tests (LDTs), creating the need for a standardized, accurate, non-invasive assay that may be decentralized to inform the clinical management of patients for treatment with immunotherapies. Cell-free tumor-specific genetic alterations, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), are detectable in the plasma of ?80% of cancer patients with metastatic disease. Reliable detection of tumor specific alterations in plasma can aid in the stratification of patients for targeted therapies and overcome the need for tumor tissue by traditional molecular approaches. The goal of this proposal is to develop a stand-alone molecular diagnostic assay to determine MSI status from plasma in cancer patients (known as CancerPRO MSI) to guide immunotherapy for multiple indications."
"9471152","Racial and rural-urban disparities in stroke care and outcomes are most prominent in the Southeastern region of the US, where 3 states have long been recognized as representing the `buckle' of a `stroke belt', i.e. highly stroke-prone tri-state area within a broader region already more heavily burdened with stroke compared to the rest of the country. One of these 3 states is South Carolina (SC). Fortunately, stroke is eminently preventable and hypertension (HTN) is the premier modifiable risk factor for stroke, but fewer than one third of patients with a recent stroke have their blood pressure (BP) controlled ?75% of the time and low consistency of BP control is linked to higher risk of future major vascular events. Key factors responsible for uncontrolled HTN in African Americans (AA) are medication non-adherence and failure to intensify therapy in a timely manner. As such, culturally-tailored, efficacious blood pressure control programs which are acceptable, feasible, timely, and sustainable are needed, especially among hypertensive stroke survivors who reside in the stroke buckle or who are AA. Mobile health (mHealth) technology offers a promising approach to address this need. The overall objective of the Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) study is to demonstrate that a theoretical-model- based, mHealth technology-centered, multi-level integrated approach can be effectively implemented to improve sustained BP control among stroke patients encountered in South Carolina (at least half of whom will be AA) within one month of stroke symptom onset. The primary aim is conduct an implementation trial (at the patient level) of the PACESETTER intervention [health technology (personalized phone text messaging and home BP monitoring)] vs. usual care in 200 recent stroke patients with hypertension recruited across the three main safety net hospitals in the state of SC (in the cities of Charleston, Columbia, and Greenville). Primary outcome will be achievement of guideline-recommended systolic blood pressure control at 12 months. We also aim to explore whether implementation of the PACESETTER intervention vs. standard care is associated with a reduction in subsequent cardiovascular event-related re-hospitalizations, shows a signal of potential efficacy in reducing actual vascular events, and has distinct effects on providers caring for patients with stroke. Altogether, the PACESETTER intervention, if proven effective and implementable, may eventually be exported to other medically underserved populations in the US beyond SC, as a feasible model of evidence-based post-stroke management."

"9271025","PROJECT SUMMARY Improving STEM-focused curriculum is a primary objective of the current U.S. administration and is crucial for ensuring that upcoming generations receive the training and skills necessary to compete in the existing global economy. To that end, there is an urgent need for additional effective teaching tools able to reach a generation that requires instant access to information and advanced technology. Of particular interest to this proposal is the development of a highly interactive, marketable, and effective educational video game that focuses on STEM topics and targets middle school students?the age at which interest in STEM subjects is developed or lost. The creation of carefully developed and evaluated educational video games is timely and necessary to ensure the promotion of desirable learning principles for middle school students. The long-term goal of our interdisciplinary team is to produce a growing library of educational video games with immersive graphics and audio, challenging gameplay, and a well-rounded delivery of STEM-focused educational content. Planning and implementation activities based on our specific aims are as follows: (Aim 1) Create an educational video game and teacher lesson plan with significant commercial potential that increases awareness of the science of agriculture, nutrition and implications on human health. Initially, this game will focus on middle school aged children, but expansion capabilities will be built into the game structure. Teachers and students, as a vital component of the development team, will contribute to the design of the game ? ensuring that its relevance to the classroom is maximized. (Aim 2) Evaluate the game for effectiveness in the delivery of STEM educational goals, including the increased use of science, technology, engineering and math in agriculture and nutrition. The creation of a highly effective STEM-focused video game that incorporates the Next Generation Science and Common Core Standards will provide teachers with an innovative classroom tool that is engaging to the students, while improving interest in STEM subjects and increasing STEM knowledge."
"9406668","Growing evidence from multimodal brain imaging studies highlights the importance of a synergistic approach towards characterizing the neurobiological substrate of reading disability (RD). The overall goal of Project 4 (Imaging) is to develop a comprehensive model of brain network connectivity changes that relate to changes in academic skills. Academic skills interface with task control and attention brain networks in important but poorly understood ways. Project 4 will supplement the cognitive framework developed within Project 2 (Attention). In addition, we propose to evaluate features of brain organization associated with developmental outcomes of the educational interventions addressed in Project 3 (Intervention). Project 4 (Neuroimaging) will address three aims. The first aim is to characterize structural and functional brain connectivity related to change in academic skills and attention abilities, using a dimensional and multimodal imaging approach (Resting-state fMRI, quantitative structural MRI, and DTI). We will use multiple task localizers to generate regions to serve as nodes for network analyses at the individual and group levels and analyze network changes over 3 scans spanning the two years of middle school (beginning of 7th grade, end of 7th, end of 8th grade). The second aim is to test for brain network relationships that are impacted by bilingual language proficiency, and comorbid conditions (e.g. ADHD) within a group of English language learners who have persistent reading difficulties. This aim models individual response to educational interventions (Project 3) as a function of aberrant features of brain organization and connectivity, and uses a rich contextual dataset (Project 2) to test for the impact of important interacting factors. The third aim tests the predictive value of pre-intervention brain data for subsequent response to intervention. Addressing this aim entails training a multivariate pattern analysis model with cohort 1 data (years 1-3), and evaluating the results of that model with independent data from cohort 2 (years 3-5). We will test which type of brain data (e.g. DTI, cortical thickness, resting-state) best predicts future group membership (improver vs. non-improver). We predict that future academic gains will be stronger for those with stronger structural connectivity and tighter within-network correlations (better brain tuning). By successfully addressing these aims, Project 4 will promote novel directions in cognitive neuroscience research featuring longitudinal, multimodal imaging analysis of academic change, identifying features of brain organization that are crucial for typical development of academic skills and predicting successful intervention outcomes."

This will be accomplished by increasing scientific collaborations in these diseases between investigators at UZCHS and investigators in high income countries; strengthening the capacity of investigators at UZCHS to conduct cutting edge research to better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis, and improve diagnosis and treatment of cancer and cardiovascular disease in Zimbabwe; and establishing the evidence base needed to inform public health policy to improve care of these diseases in Zimbabwe."
"9376268","Abstract Current in vitro models of vascularized bone tissues do not mimic the in vivo microenvironment comprising of diverse cell types in communication with each other through stromal barriers. In addition, they are hampered by lack of real-time visualization and quantitation of vasculature-bone as well as bone-cartilage interactions. In contrast, animal models while providing useful information are time consuming, expensive and in recent years, have increasingly raised ethical concerns. Furthermore, animal studies provide limited understanding of mechanistic behavior compared to well-controlled in vitro studies. Thus, there is an unmet need for an in vitro platform for improved monitoring and analysis of vascularized bone-cartilage interactions. We propose to develop and demonstrate a multi-scale model of vascularized bone-cartilage tissue for the understanding of cellular signaling with a Phase I focus on the interactions between endothelial cells, bone cells, specifically osteoblasts (bone-building cells) and osteoclasts (bone-degrading cells), and chondrocytes (cartilage cells). The multi-scale nature of the proposed approach is based on the use of (a) a microscale based vascular bone-cartilage model using microfluidics and tissue engineering to study cell signaling, which informs (b) a meso-scale vascular bone-cartilage model interrogating both engineered constructs and native tissues for structural and functional studies. Phase I will clearly and unequivocally demonstrate the use of this multiscale model of vascularized osteochondral tissue interactions for cell signaling. The developed platform will mimic the morphology, physiological flow and 3D multi-cellular compositions observed in vivo and enable an easy and robust system for evaluation of cellular responses. In Phase II, the platform will be expanded to include other stromal cells (e.g., fibroblasts), and immune cells (e.g., macrophages), followed by detailed characterization of the signaling molecules and therapeutic screening. A multi-disciplinary industry-academic partnership with expertise in microfluidics cell based assays and musculoskeletal biology and tissue regeneration has been assembled for successful completion of this project. By providing an accurate, quantitative and predictive model of physiological interactions, the developed multi-scale platform promises to establish a new paradigm for in vitro assessment of the physiological response to therapeutics."
"9567359","Refinement and Implementation of the Automated Oligosaccharide Synthesizer Project Summary Carbohydrates form the basis of all living organisms and, as a consequence, are ubiquitous both in nature as biologically active compounds and in medicine as therapeutics. Although there has been continued interest in the synthesis of carbohydrates, and the inherent complexity of these molecules consistently captures the attention of many scientists, methods for the isolation, chemical or enzymatic synthesis, analysis, and application of carbohydrates remain cumbersome. Ever-increasing time constraints and cost limitations on research and development in glycoscience and glycotechnology call for the development of rapid, efficient and operationally simple procedures. While this represents an immense task, this proposal will focus on the introduction of an affordable and accessible automation platform that will enable both specialists and non- specialists to perform the synthesis of glycans. Current automated methods for the synthesis of oligosaccharides are highly sophisticated, operationally complex, and require significant user know-how. By contrast, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipment-based automation introduced by Demchenko and Stine represents a highly accessible method of synthesis. This is because many glycoscientists have operational knowledge of, and easy access to, HPLC equipment. The automated synthesis offers not only operational simplicity by delivering all reagents using standard autosamplers, but also convenient real-time reaction monitoring of every step using detectors and standard computer software and interface. We achieved faster reaction times using less reactant, reagent, and solvent than manual solid-phase synthesis. Building upon promising preliminary results, this proposal aims to generate a user-friendly, universal platform for automated and transformative synthesis of glycans. While the proposed automation approach has the potential to revolutionize glycan synthesis, practically every aspect of solid phase synthesis needs to be refined. This proposal is organized into four specific aims. The first three aims are dedicated to the refinement of inherent limitations of solid phase synthesis: 1) new affordable resins and the universal linker for solid phase synthesis; 2) new concepts for catalytic and stereocontrolled glycosylation; and 3) new methods for streamlined access to building blocks. The fourth aim is dedicated to the implementation of autosamplers as a mode for automation of the oligosaccharide synthesis. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we expect to have acquired a reliable and simple platform for automated oligosaccharide synthesis. Many classes of compounds can be obtained using solid supports; therefore, the proposed study is expected to be of valuable methodological and practical use to many scientists. Investigators with access to standard HPLC equipment should be able to perform automated synthesis of glycan libraries using our reagent kits or easily interface with their existing methods and equipment. Synthesis of carbohydrates and other classes of biomolecules using this user-friendly, automated platform will accelerate discovery in many scientific disciplines and can significantly impact technology, society, the economy, and public health."
"9370321","The overall goal of this Center of Research Translation is to utilize biomarker tools and other translational research observations to discover new therapies for patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). This goal can be broken down into four intermediate objectives: understanding pathogenic pathways through translational studies, developing biomarkers for SSc, developing novel therapeutics, and applying bioinformatic and systems biology approaches to interpret translational and biomarker data. Among current obstacles to progress in finding new drugs for SSc patients is the continuing limited understanding of pathogenesis of SSc disease, in part due to its complexity and heterogeneity, and in part due to the lack of good animal models. Innovative protocols of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Boston University Medical Center for obtaining SSc skin and lung biosamples will allow investigators to discover the genes, regulatory proteins, mediators and cells that promote fibrosis and vascular injury in SSc patients. These include very large, longitudinal clinical-biological sample repositories; SSc lung transplant and warm autopsy programs; and skin biopsy, ex vivo lung perfusion, functional distal pulmonary arterial myography and lung explant culture protocols. In Project 1 investigators will validate biomarkers of SSc skin and lung disease, investigate mesenchymal cell heterogeneity in normal and SSc skin using single cell RNA-seq, and study the effect of blocking genes associated with myofibroblast differentiation. In Project 2 investigators will examine altered markers of oxidative stress and mitophagy in SSc leukocytes and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells obtained during right heart catheterization and from dissected pulmonary arteries of patients with SSc- associated pulmonary arterial hypertension. They will also investigate the effect of the recently approved Nrf2 inhibitor, dimethyl fumarate, on endothelial cells in these systems. In Project 3 investigators will study expression of ubiquitin ligases in SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). They will also design optimal ubiquitin ligase antagonists for SSc-ILD using quantitative structure-activity relationships, and test these inhibitors in lung explant and ex vivo lung perfusion models. Project aims will be supported by three resource cores: a Clinical and Biological Specimen Core, a Lung Tissue Core and a Translational Genomics and Data Integration Core. The latter will synthesize data from each project and across projects, to develop models for common molecular pathways associated with different disease manifestations. The focus of each of the projects on different SSc clinical manifestations, mediators of disease, and drug inhibitors will provide a rich, highly collaborative environment for fundamental discovery within bridging project topics and core resources. This will be further enhanced by the complementary experience of the project and core investigators in biosampling, biomarkers, translational medicine, drug development, bioinformatics and systems biology, culminating in the development of new, targeted therapeutics.

This is in part due to the difficulty in distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in this segment of the population and performing complete case ascertainment in fragmented health care systems.  This study fills these gaps by assessing the performance in terms of timeliness, accuracy, and costs of a surveillance system for type 1 diabetes in the young adult population."
"9470705","PROJECT SUMMARY About 80% of individuals with a moderate to severe ischemic stroke suffer from upper extremity motor impairment, particularly affecting the wrist and fingers. Wrist/finger weakness in these individuals is greater for extensors than flexors, causing difficulty in hand opening, and leading to a dysfunctional wrist/finger flexed posture. Moreover, more severely impaired individuals involuntarily close the hand when attempting to open. Previous neuroimaging studies of this impairment have reported increased neural activity in motor cortices of both lesioned and contralesional hemispheres in these individuals during hand movements. It is also found that the more severe the stroke, the greater activity in the contralesional hemisphere compared to the ipsilesional (i.e. shift of activity to non-lesioned hemisphere). It remains unclear, however, which motor pathways allow the contralesional motor cortex to control the ipsilateral paretic arm in these individuals, therefore leading to a preserved ability for wrist/ fingers flexion and restrained extension. One proposed explanation for the contralesional cortical hyperactivity in individuals with stroke could be an increased reliance on ipsilateral brainstem motor pathways from the spared hemisphere. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that stimulation of reticulospinal tract nuclei in brainstem causes limb flexion in elbow, wrist and fingers. Given this information, I hypothesize that relative preservation to flex and limitation to extend hand/fingers post stroke is the result of greater reliance on indirect contralesional cortico-reticulospinal pathways following damage to the corticospinal pathway in the lesioned hemisphere. Corticospinal and cortico-reticulospinal tracts pass through the same regions in the brain, but completely separate areas in pons, medulla and spinal cord. The overall aim of this proposal, therefore, is to test the activity in reticulospinal tract nuclei in brainstem, as well as the structural changes in reticolospinal and corticospinal tracts in brainstem and spinal cord. Activation in brainstem reticulospinal tracts nuclei will be determined in individuals with stroke compared to controls using fMRI during hand opening and closing tasks, while recording hand movement kinematics and grasping force as well (Aim 1). Given the fact that neural activity changes over the time lead to morphological changes, high resolution anatomical MRI and DTI (diffusion tensor imaging) will be also used to identify the morphological changes in corticospinal and reticulospinal tracts in brainstem (Aim2a). Finally, to reconfirm morphological changes more caudally, white matter integrity of corticospinal and reticulospinal tracts will be quantified at the cervical spinal cord in individuals with stroke and in controls (Aim2b). Findings from the proposed work will elucidate motor pathways involved in hand dysfunction post stroke and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic interventions post stroke."

The Developmental Research Program (DRP) will encourage new research directions and help to facilitate collaborations. It will provide initial support to pilot projects, and thus will foster the development of new translational projects, an important goal given the circuitous path to clinical development of agents that might be effective in myeloid malignancies. It will provide the opportunity for the DF/HCC Spore in Myeloid Malignancies to recruit new investigators with a diverse range of backgrounds and institutional affiliations. An important aspect of the DRP will be a wide announcement of access to these funds. The program will solicit applications on the web and by frequent email announcements to quality projects with a high likelihood of translational impact. To achieve this goal we will: 1) Solicit applications and/or identifying novel research projects in myeloid malignancies 2) Evaluate these projects for funding, 3) Fund the most innovative developmental projects, 4) Re-evaluate projects for possible transition into full project status 5) Evaluate success of the program."
"9418230","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The burden of prostate cancer in the U.S. is large: an estimated 14% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. There are approximately three million prostate cancer survivors in the U.S., and the burden is highest among black men, for whom incidence and mortality rates are 169.4 and 69.0 per 100,000, respectively. The introduction of prostate-specific antigen screening has resulted in detection of more cases of prostate cancer, although many of these cases are asymptomatic and may not progress to clinical significance. Active surveillance is a management option for low-risk prostate cancer patients, during which the disease is actively monitored. Active surveillance patients are an ideal population for lifestyle interventions, which may improve diet and physical activity, reduce body mass index, and improve clinical biomarkers, thus reducing risk of other chronic conditions and second primary cancers and improving patients' quality of life. Thus far, several lifestyle interventions for patients undergoing active surveillance have had positive results; however, none have targeted spouses or partners, or black men, in their design and implementation. The proposed study seeks to pilot test Watchful Living, an innovative, culturally-relevant social support lifestyle intervention during active surveillance for black prostate cancer patients and their partners. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the feasibility of recruiting and implementing a lifestyle intervention during active surveillance for prostate cancer patients and their partners, 2) To evaluate preliminary efficacy of an active surveillance lifestyle intervention in improving diet, physical activity, quality of life, and inflammation at the end of the study (Month 6), and 3) To conduct a process evaluation of the active surveillance lifestyle intervention. We will recruit 40 patient-partner dyads from MD Anderson Cancer Center and Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, who will receive dyadic telephone coaching, exercise prescriptions in a home-based physical activity program, nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian, and educational handouts. Watchful Living has the potential to ultimately prevent morbidity and mortality due to prostate cancer by significantly reducing chronic diseases and second primary cancers, and improving the quality of life of black patients and their partners. Pilot funding is critical to demonstrating the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of our intervention. With this pilot data, we will apply for an R01 to adapt, implement, and evaluate the intervention on a larger scale."
"9376782","Project Summary The kidney plays a critical role in regulating potassium homeostasis by adjusting secretion in the distal nephron to match daily dietary intake. Distal K+ secretion involves K+ efflux through apical ROMK K+ channels, a process that requires Na+ reabsorption via ENaC to provide the electrical driving force for K+ secretion. The activity of the Na+- Cl- cotransporter, NCC, impacts distal K+ secretion by altering Na+ delivery to ENaC. Thus, besides upregulating ROMK, high dietary K+ intake enhances distal K+ secretion by downregulating NCC. WNK1 and WNK4 are protein kinases in which gain-of-function mutations cause an autosomal-dominant hypertension and hyperkalemia syndrome, pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, which occurs at least in part by increasing Na+ reabsorption via NCC and decreasing K+ secretion via ROMK. How dietary K+ intake regulates NCC and how WNK1 and 4 activate NCC and inhibit ROMK remain unresolved. As a part of long-term goal to understand the mechanism of renal Na+ and K+ transport in health and disease, we propose the following studies. Aim-1 will test the hypothesis that WNK1 and WNK4 both activate NCC in vivo and that it occurs via the OSR1/SPAK kinase cascade. We will examine the role of WNK1 and 4 on NCC in vivo using kidney-specific conditional Wnk1-knockout mice (to circumvent embryonic lethality of global Wnk1-deleted mice) and global Wnk4-deleted mice, respectively. Double knockout mice will be studied to investigate whether WNK1 and 4 are additive or antagonistic. The role of OSR1/SPAK in mediating WNK1/4 regulation of NCC will be investigated based on the ability of expression of catalytically constitutive-active OSR1/SPAK to rescue loss-of-function of NCC in mice lacking Wnk1 and/or Wnk4. The activity and expression of NCC in kidney will be assessed by analyzing the increase of urinary Na+ excretion in response to hydrochlorothiazide and western blot analysis of the total and phosphorylated NCC. Aim-2 will examine the hypothesis that WNK kinase cascade mediates dietary K+ intake-induced regulation of NCC. Abundant in vitro and cell-based evidence implicate that dietary K+ intake regulates NCC by altering intracellular chloride concentration to affect WNK kinase activity. We will test the hypothesis in vivo using mice carry Wnk4-null alleles and kidney- specific conditional Wnk1-knockout mice. Mice will be fed a normal K+ or low K+ diet and studied for NCC activity. Aim-3 will test hypothesis that WNK kinases can directly inhibit renal K+ secretion independently of the effect via increasing NCC-mediated Na+ reabsorption using whole animal clearance studies and in vitro microperfusion of cortical collecting ducts isolated from wild-type mice versus mice whose WNKs are deleted but NCC activity is normalized by constitutive-active SPAK/OSR1. These studies using state-of-the-art animal models and physiological approaches will provide important in vivo information for our understanding of the mechanism of renal Na+ and K+ handling in physiological and diseased states."
"9453361","Project Summary/Abstract Preterm birth occurs at < 37 weeks gestation. It is associated with a host of newborn risks that increase the risk of preterm related infant death. The United States leads other industrialized nations in preterm birth rate and, for reasons unknown, non-Hispanic Black women in the U.S. have a 50% higher preterm birth rate compared to the overall national prevalence. Current preterm prevention strategies are limited due to lack of understanding about the underlying mechanisms of preterm birth. The association between intrauterine infection and preterm birth is well-established. Emerging research suggests that periodontal disease may be an etiologic source of this infection. Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition that begins as a direct immune response to microorganisms that inhabit the subgingival biofilm. Pregnant women and racial/ethnic minorities are particularly at risk for periodontal disease. Gingival inflammation during pregnancy may allow for the movement of inflammatory products into the circulatory system and to the maternal-fetal unit, triggering an inflammatory cascade which may increase the likelihood of preterm birth. Critical to understanding the association between periodontal disease and preterm birth, is an understanding of the subgingival microbiome. This study, therefore, aims to: 1) Characterize the structure and diversity of the subgingival microbiome and of pregnant non-Hispanic Black women in early and late pregnancy. 2) Explore the relationship between the subgingival microbiome and localized inflammation. 3) Explore associations between localized and systemic inflammation, and gestational age at birth. Results from this study will inform an innovative approach to the assessment and intervention of periodontal disease in pregnant women as a potential modifiable target risk factor for preterm birth, thereby promoting maternal health, and preventing adverse birth outcomes for women and their newborns. The overarching goal of this K01 career development proposal is the development of Dr. Yang?s expertise in three areas: microbiome data analysis, oral health research, and health disparities research. The proposed project, in conjunction with the structured mentoring and training plan which includes didactic courses, workshops, and hands-on experience, are designed to facilitate this goal, as well as Dr. Yang?s long-term goal of developing an independently-funded biobehavioral research program that investigates how physiologic mechanisms combine with social, behavioral and environmental factors to give rise to maternal health disparities."
"9349337","Project Summary  The majority of the US population that suffers from temporomandibular joint (TMJ) degeneration and osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA) are females between 45 and 65 years old. Prevalence of TMJ-OA in this population suggests that estrogen loss plays a role in the disease pathogenesis. Previous evidence from our lab suggests that estrogen through estrogen receptor alpha (ER?) protects the TMJ from degeneration by promoting Col2 and proteoglycan production. Further, we have preliminary evidence indicating that estrogen-ER? inhibits Wnt pathway signaling. These findings suggest that estrogen signaling promotes chondrogenesis via ER? by mediating the canonical Wnt pathway. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of ER? signaling on mandibular condylar cartilage matrix production and TMJ homeostasis. The proposed work comprises two aims:  AIM 1: Evaluate the role of estrogen via ER? on collagen type II (Col2) production. We hypothesize that estrogen promotes Col2 transcription via ER? by inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. To confirm the effects of estrogen-ER? on chondrogenesis, reporter mice will be utilized to examine upregulation of Col2 and downregulation of Wnt signaling with estrogen and an ER? agonist. Then, the ability of estrogen-ER? to promote chondrogenesis by inhibiting Wnt signaling will be determined by activating the Wnt pathway in WT and ER?KO mice in an ovariectomy-estrogen replacement model.  AIM 2: Determine the effects of ER? deficiency on TMJ degeneration and correlate to resulting compressive properties and masticatory function. We hypothesize that ER?KO mice will exhibit accelerated age-related TMJ degeneration which will correspond to a decrease in compressive modulus, fixed charge density, and bite force compared to WT controls. Changes in matrix composition will be correlated to alterations in compressive properties and masticatory function. The results from this proposed research will provide evidence of the sex predilection of TMJ degeneration and provide therapeutic targets (e.g. ER? agonist) to delay degeneration. Through this work, we aim to enhance the understanding of estrogen?s role in TMJ condylar cartilage chondrogenesis and homeostasis. Also, the development of TMJ condylar cartilage structure/function relationships will be beneficial for the development of regenerative therapies to combat TMJ degeneration."
"9395774","Project Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-linked neurodegenerative disease that is the leading cause of dementia and 6th leading cause of death in the United States. It is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid ? (A?) peptides. In the healthy brain, several mechanisms facilitate clearance of A? prior to pathogenic accumulation. The function of these clearance mechanisms deteriorates as an individual ages. To develop effective therapeutic strategies for patients with AD, it is important to understand the mechanisms that drive A? clearance, and the source of their dysfunction in the aged brain. Previous research has shown that the recently described glymphatic system is one such mechanism involved in A? clearance that also demonstrates age-linked dysfunction. Proper glymphatic function relies on mixing of cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) with interstitial fluid (ISF) along perivascular spaces throughout the brain. This process is mediated by water flux across astrocytes that ensheathe the brain vasculature. The water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) supports this water flux, and is highly localized to perivascular astrocytic endfeet in the healthy brain, but loses this localization in the aging brain and with AD status. Recent research has shown that in a transgenic mouse model of AD, deletion of the Aqp4 gene in mice increases A? plaque accumulation and worsens cognitive impairment. In aging mice and humans with AD, while overall expression of AQP4 is maintained, perivascular AQP4 localization is lost. Importantly, whether the loss of endfoot localization of AQP4 seen in the aging brain promotes accumulation of A? in a similar manner to that seen in Aqp4 knockout mice is not known. The goal of this proposal is to determine the role that loss of perivascular AQP4 localization plays in A? accumulation, and identify cellular mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of AQP4 perivascular localization and break down in the aging brain. In Aim 1, I will assess the effect of loss of perivascular localization on A? clearance using a mouse model that features both a lack of perivascular AQP4 localization and spontaneous A? plaque formation. In Aim 2 of the proposal I will investigate whether changes in dystrophin associated complex proteins regulate perivascular AQP4 localization in the aging brain, and how loss of their expression impacts A? plaque burden. In Aim 3 I will investigate a second candidate regulatory mechanism for AQP4 localization, the expression of alternate AQP4 isoforms using an astrocyte-specific viral overexpression paradigm to isolate the role of each AQP4 isoform. This study will be the first to define the consequences of age-linked loss of astrocytic perivascular AQP4 localization. Additionally it will be one of the first to examine the mechanisms underlying changes in perivascular AQP4 localization in vivo. The results of this study will provide insight into AQP4 as a potential therapeutic target for AD and other neuropathologies that demonstrate an accumulation of protein aggregates including Parkinson's and Huntington's disease."
"9252928","Exploratory Clinical Study to Evaluate the Potential Bioactivity of CLBS14 in Patients with Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction Project Summary/Abstract CLBS14 is an autologous cell therapy consisting of G-CSF mobilized autologous CD34+ cells obtained from peripheral blood. The primary mode of action is improvement in perfusion by neo-angiogenesis and/or microvascular function under conditions of inadequate perfusion. The therapeutic focus of the proposed clinical study is coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), for which therapeutic strategies are limited. Approximately 20 subjects with CMD will be enrolled in the single arm study. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential bioactivity of intracoronary delivery of autologous CD34+ cells (CLBS14) in subjects with CMD and no obstructive coronary artery disease, as determined by invasive testing of coronary microvascular function as determined by assessment of coronary flow reserve (CFR). Additional data will be collected on endothelial-dependent microvascular function as determined by measurement of coronary blood flow in reaction to acetylcholine; endothelial-independent microvascular function as determined by measurement of coronary blood flow in reaction to adenosine; peripheral arterial tonometry; quality of life as measured with an angina diary, Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), and a health-related quality of life questionnaire; exercise tolerance as assessed by treadmill testing and by recording of daily activities with a Fitbit. The study is being designed and implemented by well-regarded investigators in CD34+ cell therapy and ischemic cardiac disease. Dr. Douglas Losordo from Caladrius Biosciences is the sponsor and study director and the investigators are Dr. Timothy Henry and Noel Bairey Merz of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Dr. Amir Lerman of the Mayo Clinic. Cedars-Sinai and Mayo Clinic are co investigators on the grant. Product manufacturing is provided by PCT, a Caladrius Company and a recognized leader in contract cell therapy manufacturing. For preparation of CLBS14, each patient is treated with G-CSF for up to 5 days to mobilize CD34+ cells from the bone marrow and into peripheral blood. Each patient undergoes apheresis to provide the starting material for manufacturing CLBS14. The apheresis material is processed to separate and enrich CD34+ cells, which are then formulated for administration back to the patient via intra-coronary infusion. Following infusion of CLBS14, patients are monitored for safety and efficacy endpoints for up to one year. It is expected that the trial will take approximately 2 years to complete. Results from the research will be presented in one or more public forums and published in a peer-reviewed journal. With the novel angiogenic mechanism of action of CLBS14 and specifically targeting coronary microvascular dysfunction to improve coronary microvascular flow responsible for the major adverse cardiac events and poor quality of life in this population, this project will be a strong contributor to NIH?s mission to develop new and effective therapies for underserved diseases.

This telephone-based coaching intervention is based on an existing coaching strategy currently in use in VA that helps family members talk to a Veteran about their decisions to seek care and helps the Veteran find the right treatment program when this Veteran becomes willing to get help. This enhanced strategy is based on a face-to-face treatment method that has received ample research support, but will be presented in an educational format on a website. The telephone coaching will work with the family member who uses this web-based program, helping them apply the lessons in an individualized way to their own relationship with the Veteran, and also provides support to this family member. This project will be a first step in a larger project meant to test whether this enhanced coaching intervention strategy is better than those currently in use. These methods will address an important reintegration concern of family member supporters of our newest Veterans-how to help the Veteran in their family to make decisions to seek care for a substance abuse problem."
"9484590","Abstract  The health of minorities and the reduction and eventual elimination of health disparities in the United States will  largely depend on advancements in scientific health disparities research. Such advancements can only be  accomplished by training, mentoring, and supporting the next generation of health disparities scientists.  Consequently, the primary goal of the Investigator Development Core of the Center for Latino Health Research  Opportunities (CLaRO) is to enhance the scientific career development of diverse post-doctoral fellows, junior  faculty, and other early stage investigators at the University of Miami. The Specific Aims of the Investigator  Development Core are to: (1) Conduct a Pilot Projects Program to enhance the scientific career development  of diverse early career health disparity researchers. The Pilot Projects Program will fund 30 to 35 studies at the  University of Miami (UM) that collect preliminary data related to the Center?s theme and conceptual framework  to generate new R-level grant applications. The Core will also facilitate and support the dissemination of study  findings from these pilot projects; (2) Deliver, in collaboration with the Administrative Core, a Research  Education Training Program for early career health disparity researchers. This annual two-week training  program will focus on providing research experience and increasing the skills required for the development and  submission of competitive NIH R-level research grant applications. The Research Education Training Program  will include (but not be limited to) topics such as: NIMHD?s health disparities research framework, etiology of  health disparities in Latino populations, grantsmanship, and responsible conduct for research when conducting  Latino health research; and (3) Link pilot project awardees and trainees participating in the Research  Education Training Program to two mentors: a research mentor at UM from the Scientific Mentorship Board  and a career mentor external to UM. Research mentors will guide trainees in the specific content area (e.g.,  integrated substance abuse and HIV prevention intervention development for Latino sexual/gender minority  youth), whereas career mentors will provide guidance to mentees on general professional/career development.  This mentoring strategy recognizes the importance of a multi-mentor approach with a focus on both content  area and professional development. It also recognizes the fact that some important mentoring roles may be  accomplished with distance mentoring through e-mails, phone and video conferences, and infrequent  meetings. The Investigator Development Core capitalizes on the infrastructure and expertise inherent in the  Administrative and the Community Engagement and Dissemination cores and on the expertise of more than  two dozen senior faculty mentors at the UM conducting research in CLaRO?s thematic areas and producing  more than $30 million dollars of annualized NIH funding.

"9482258","ABSTRACT. Problem. There are distinct sex-based differences that affect the natural history of HIV infection and HIV- specific immune responses. These differences are partially driven by sex hormones (estrogens in particular) and might influence the size, distribution and transcriptional activity of the HIV reservoirs. Globally, women account for over half of all people living with HIV but represent only 11% of participants in HIV cure research resulting in a significant knowledge gap between the biology of HIV in men and women. Even less is known about how this effect changes when women are entering menopause and hormonal levels starts to decline. What we know now.  ? Women have lower levels of HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than men.  ? Various in vitro studies reported sex-based differences on HIV infection and replication in target cells.  ? Women have different HIV-specific immune responses than men.  ? These differences are partially driven by estradiol that inhibits HIV replication in PBMCs through estrogen  receptor dependent mechanisms. A recent ex vivo study (by Jon Karn et al) provided strong evidence that  estrogen inhibits HIV transcriptional activity in a sex-specific manner. Proposed Solution. We will request longitudinal stored samples from 30 HIV-infected women aged 40-55 at enrollment (not taking hormonal therapy) and 30 men (similar age) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with suppressed HIV RNA for >48 weeks. This age range was selected to maximize variability in hormonal levels (across study participants and longitudinally) and because younger women are more likely to take hormonal therapy. Our goal. We will characterize extensively the HIV reservoir and generate immunological data at each time- point. We will use these data to determine the effect of sex hormones and receptor expression (in particular estradiol) on the HIV reservoir size and transcriptional activity over 3+ years of follow-up while on ART. We will compare these data with a similar group of men. How will we advance the field. To date, the majority of HIV cure research has used male participants and therefore a significant knowledge gap exists between men and women. We do not know if the same immune- modulatory interventions will be effective in promoting HIV RNA transcription in men and women and how declining sex hormones will impact their efficacy. In particular, agents that are designed for ?kick and kill? strategies may be especially impacted by estradiol-mediated mechanisms. A better understanding of these differences will assist in the design of future cure approaches that can be applied across sexes."
"9466962","This program aims to develop a novel method for cryopreserving human testicular tissue and whole testes, which can also be applied to ovarian tissue and gonadal preservation and ultimately any cells, tissues, and whole organs. This multi-pronged approach builds on recent advances in machine perfusion, nature-inspired cytoprotection strategies, and non-toxic cryoprotectant solutions, combining them with our novel method for constant-volume, pressure-assisted cooling. Our method promises to achieve vitrification of living tissues without the aid of toxic concentrations of cryoprotectants, in a system at thermodynamic equilibrium and potentially at temperatures as high as -80C (capable of dry-ice shipment). It ameliorates or entirely circumvents many of the limitations of conventional cryopreservation methods for large tissues, including damaging ice crystallization, deleterious changes in solute concentrations, and volumetric changes. This approach has the potential to enable indefinite banking of testicular tissues, whole testes, and other living materials while dramatically limiting tissue injury currently associated with ex-vivo storage. The technical objective of this Phase 1 proposal is to develop an optimized cocktail and protocol for preservation and indefinite banking of testicular tissue. We will develop our method across three specific aims. Building upon preliminary studies that demonstrate the feasibility of isochoric preservation, in Aim 1 we will begin with extended feasibility studies focused on investigating the combined effects of temperature, pressure and CPA on testicular-cell viability following equilibrium ice-free isochoric preservation. Specifically, we will use semi- high-throughput screening to measure the viability of human Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and endothelial cells with targeted pressures of up to 160 MPa (pressure at which red-blood cells show improved cryopreservation). In parallel studies in Aim 2, we will use well established methods developed by our broader group to define new thermodynamic profiles for novel, nature-inspired cryoprotectant solutions in an isochoric (constant- volume) system; this will allow us to select solutions that allow for pressure-assisted vitrification of living materials at low to intermediate pressures and much higher storage temperatures than traditionally needed for ice-free cryopreservation. In Aim 3, we select the most effective cryoprotectant solutions established in Aim 1-2 to evaluate our ?high sub-zero vitrification? in human testicular tissue strips and compare outcome with conventional state-of-the-art isobaric preservation. Tissue will be evaluated by measuring tissue-viability, as well as histology, immunohistochemistry and xenotransplantation into infertile nude mice. We will additionally test the augmentation of these methods with subnormothermic machine perfusion, enabling further reduction of ischemic tissue injury. Success of these novel approaches individually or in combination will likely enable breakthroughs in oncofertility and biopreservation research and clinical practice."
"9484555","PROJECT SUMMARY The Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions The HCHDS was established in 2002 with funding from the NCMHD-EXPORT Center program and renewed under the COE program in 2006 and 2011. Our primary objective is to be a national resource for advancing the science of health equity and identifying and promulgating solutions for reducing and eliminating health disparities. Based in the Department of Health Policy and Management in the Bloomberg School of Public Health, we promote and encourage health disparities research, training and community engagement using the resources of the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health, Medicine and Nursing. Over the next five years we propose to conduct three major research projects that primarily focus on interpersonal and community-level influences. The cross-cutting theme for these projects is ?exploring and addressing the impact of place-based determinants in health disparities among African Americans.? We define place broadly as the physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, and the healthcare system. The physical/built environments include contextual/distal factors that influence outcomes such as household, neighborhood, and community level factors. Sociocultural environment includes family and community norms, social support, social networks, social connectedness, and segregation by race/ethnicity, rurality, socioeconomic status, and language. The healthcare system includes the influence of local healthcare market characteristics, the regulatory environment, and policy level factors."

"9351171","7. Project Summary/Abstract  The BUILD proposal combines into one initiative 3 of the 6 projects developed by the MDEpiNet SMART Informatics Think Tank, which was a multi-stakeholder assembly of device manufacturers, system architects, informaticists, supply chain professionals, clinicians, and researchers, many of whom will be working on this initiative. The purpose of the Think Tank projects was to further MDEpiNet's goal of supporting the FDA in strengthening the medical device postmarket surveillance system. The 3 pilot projects included in BUILD significantly overlap in leveraging unique device identifiers (UDIs) as the index to connect data sources and move information on devices to clinicians and researchers to assess device effectiveness and safety and support innovation. They are the Extension of UDI Implementation Pilot; Medical Device Data Capture and Exchange: Leading Practices and Future Directions; and Electrophysiology structured reporting Providing UDI for Leads and devices using industry Standards to Electronic Health Records and CVIS systems (ePulse).  The Extension of UDI Implementation Pilot builds on a previous FDA demonstration whereby UDI were incorporated in the electronic information systems of a single health system resulting in integration of clinical and device data and the creation of a database that was useable for device surveillance and research. This process will be replicated at 2 additional health systems and a distributed data network of the 3 systems will be developed using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry's (NCDR) CathPCI as the hub. The Medical Device Data Capture and Exchange project builds a consortium of hospital organization, manufacturer and other stakeholder leaders that will collaboratively work to outline the current environment of UDI use; assess project outcomes; and conceptualize innovative solutions for capture and exchange of implantable device data. It will elucidate the best practices in exchange of UDI through the supply chain to the point of care. The ePulse project, then, focuses on the point of care and will use industry-standard nomenclature and interoperability profiles, incorporating UDI to capture critical data at the time of device implantation. These granular data will be communicated to EHRs in C-CDA format. The data will then be available for use for patient care, device surveillance, quality improvement and registries such as the NCDR's ICD Registry.  The proposal, then, is to build an end to end initiative that would define leading practices for moving medical device data from the point of manufacture through the supply chain to the point of use and to capture clinical data, combine it with device data, and make the integrated data set available to the patient's electronic health record, to databases at the 3 participating health systems, and the CathPCI Registry. The methodology developed by this initiative will be extensible to all implantable medical devices. Finally, the BUILD initiative will create a road map for other health systems to replicate these methods to improve care quality and patient safety. 1"
"9339484","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Leishmaniasis refers to a group of common parasitic diseases that are highly endemic in many nations including most Middle Eastern countries. Military personnel are at risk for this vector-borne disease. Indeed, leishmaniasis reached epidemic proportions in the US military during the Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and New Dawn (OND). The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic leishmaniasis varies from 6:1 to 98:1 in different studies. It is therefore highly likely that there are many more unrecognized infections in our military personnel than the ~600 reported.  Leishmania have the ability to persist in a host even after clinical cure. Indeed, infected humans and other hosts may never clear the infection, even after disease symptoms resolve. Leishmania are known to exert a profound effect on innate and adaptive immune responses of the host during infection. Recent evidence documents that immune effects persist even after cure of disease. Thus, it is highly likely that the immune effects of leishmaniasis extend beyond measurable symptomatic disease.  Exosomes are small vesicles released from most living cells that contain protein, RNA and lipids from the cell of origin. Exosomes are now recognized as major vessels transporting immune and other response signals between host cells. Recently it was recognized that exosomes are released from Leishmania parasites. These tiny packages of information may provide clues that explain the profound systemic effects of Leishmania infection.  We have already characterized the protein content of exosomes from different life stages of Leishmania infantum, one of the causative agents of leishmaniasis in the Middle East. The current proposal is based on the hypothesis that proteins and small RNAs released in exosomes from Leishmania or from Leishmania-infected cells are responsible for the dramatic and persistent local and systemic effects of leishmaniasis on immune cell responses. These effects could be invoked during active or during asymptomatic infection. Our corollary posits that Leishmania parasites themselves release exosomes whose contents affect the intracellular environment, and which become incorporated themselves into exosomes released from host cells. An understanding of the host- and parasite-derived content of released exosomes, therefore, would provide the basis for novel approaches to diagnosis and therapy of leishmaniasis. Specific aims of this project are: Aim #1. Identify the protein and small RNA content of exosomes, and the pathway of exosome release from macrophages infected with L. major or L. infantum. Hypothesis: Exosomes from leishmania- infected macrophages contain protein and microRNAs that promote non-classical activation of infected macrophages. Aim #2. Identify proteins and small RNAs in the serum and urine exosomes from members of the US military who acquired cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iraq, and determine whether exosome proteins elicit an immune response in humans or in mice infected with L. major or L. infantum. Hypothesis: Exosomes released from Leishmania-infected mammalian cells contain dominant parasite antigens that generate an immune response in the infected individual. Aim #3. Document the immunomodulatory properties of exosomes from parasites, from infected macrophages, or circulating in serum of humans with leishmaniasis. Immune responses will be tested in human macrophages and in mouse models of L. major and L. infantum infection. Hypothesis: Exosomes exhibit functional enzymatic activities that affect the activation state and the microbicidal response of both the infected and bystander host immune cells."
"9562435","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rates of alcohol and illicit drug use (AIDU) among residents of distressed communities with concentrations of African Americans (DCAA- i.e., localities with high rates of poverty and crime) are similar to the general population. Yet AIDU has significantly higher consequences for residents in DCAAs (e.g., higher incarceration and HIV/HCV infection rates), who also have considerably less access to effective treatment of substance use disorders. This project will continue to develop and test Community Wise, an innovative multi-level intervention created in partnership with service providers, residents of DCAAs and individuals with histories of substance use disorders and incarceration, to reduce health inequalities related to AIDU. We used community-based participatory research (CBPR) to develop and pilot test Community Wise, achieving 75% intervention completion rates, despite great participant challenges (such as homelessness, AIDU, and poverty). Note that substance use disorder intervention completion rates in the literature are much lower among populations with fewer challenges (often 30 to 40%). We believe that this success is due to the CBPR model used to develop an intervention that is relevant to participants' needs. Community Wise addresses social determinants of health (e.g., stigma, poverty, lack of treatment access, housing, and meaningful employment) and inequalities related to AIDU at the micro level (e.g., cognitive and behavioral processes), meso level (e.g., relationships with individuals and organizations) and macro level (e.g., political and cultural processes). Community Wise builds on critical consciousness theory, which empowers individuals, organizations, and communities to address social determinants of health while changing individual behaviors (e.g., reducing AIDU). We propose to apply the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) - an innovative and rigorous framework that employs factorial designs - to optimize Community Wise. Specifically, using MOST we will identify the most efficient, scalable, and sustainable components of Community Wise so that we can refine the intervention protocol by including only components that significantly reduce AIDU. The long-term goal of Community Wise is to reduce health inequalities related to AIDU between men with substance use disorders and a history of incarceration residing in DCAAs and the general population through an intervention that is congruent with DCAA world views and grounded in scientific and indigenous knowledge. Data from this study will culminate in an optimized Community Wise manual; enhanced methodological strategies to develop multi-component scalable interventions using MOST and CBPR; and a better understanding of the application of critical consciousness theory to the field of health inequalities related to AIDU."
"9405966","ABSTRACT  Project 3 Project III: Understanding Risk for Early Language and Literacy Difficulties in Young Children The proposed research project investigates a broad array of early child, familial, and environmental correlates and predictors of language and early literacy difficulties and disabilities to improve our capacity to identify children at heightened risk for these developmental problems. Although there is significant awareness of the risk to typical language and early literacy development posed by familial history, early language delay, and socio-demographic and environmental influences, there remains a sizable gap in the ability to identify which specific children with one or more known risk factors will achieve normative developmental milestones by school entry versus which children will remain at or accrue high-risk status and be well below typical skill levels at school entry. Earlier identification of high-risk children is crucial to prevent the development of learning disabilities or to minimize their duration and severity. We focus on a group of children at known risk, namely 2- year olds with a familial history of language impairment, reading impairment, or both, to explore how to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of early predictors of learning difficulties at age 5. Once selected from within a large screened sample, we will trace the development and experiences of these 250 children across four years. Specific aims of the project include developing a theoretically-grounded multivariate model to improve early prediction of risk for both language and literacy difficulties, exploring the simultaneous co- developmental trajectories and potential reciprocal influences between language, phonological awareness, memory and early literacy skills, and utilizing meta-analytic methods to identify and quantitatively combine robust predictors of early language and emergent literacy skill development. Innovations of the project include a highly economically and ethnically diverse longitudinal sample initiated when children are just 24 months, complex multivariate prediction models including an extensive set of child, familial, and outside the home environmental influences, advanced statistical methods including machine learning and bivariate latent change models, and inclusion of both off-line standardized and on-line, processing-based measures of early language. A further innovation is our plan to use integrated data analysis to link the developmental trajectory of these children with that of preschool and school age children in three other longitudinal studies. Results of the proposed investigations have the potential to improve early identification of learning disabilities by identifying combinations of key predictors and add to knowledge regarding the interplay of language, cognitive and early literacy skills in a critical early developmental period."

"9415873","Even though scientists have been captivated by the diversity of brain cells for well over a century, since the initial anatomical descriptions by Santiago Ramn y Cajal, it is only recently that the developments in new technologies allowed us to truly appreciate the astonishing complexity of cell types in the mammalian brain. Yet, even today, our knowledge of cell type anatomy and function is largely limited to a few brain areas, such as the sensory cortex or the hippocampus. This lack of whole-brain data has led to generalizations from one brain area to other regions with similar architecture. However, our preliminary studies applying quantitative whole brain analyses have revealed unexpected region specific differences in cell type ratios and uncovered new gender-based differences in cellular anatomy that can inform our understanding of brain development, wiring and function. We thus believe that closing the gaps in our knowledge of the cellular architecture of the brain will be a major contribution to enable a modern quantitative understanding of the brain as a system. Here we propose to establish an Anatomical Collaboratory for Systematic Atlasing of Cell-Type Distribution and Morphology in female and male brain. This Collaboratory will apply standardized, unbiased and largely automated methods developed in our laboratories to atlas the distribution and morphology of >80 molecularly defined cell classes and cell type across all regions of the female and male brain. This work will yield the most comprehensive characterization of cell type anatomy in the mammalian brain to date, establishing a structural basis for building an integrated Cell Type Brain Atlas. Specific Aim 1: Quantify and atlas the brainwide distribution of molecularly defined cell types. This work will generate a quantitative brain atlas of the distributions of molecularly defined cell classes and cell types within the Common Coordinated Framework (CCF) of the adult brain. Specific Aim 2: Quantify and atlas the brainwide morphologies of molecularly defined cell types. This work will generate a comprehensive structural brain atlas of somatodendritic cell-type morphologies across all CCF anatomical areas in the female and male brain. Specific Aim 3: Develop and deploy a neuroinformatics infrastructure: an integrated web portal for cell-type specific data, tools, and analytics. This work will disseminate the generated data via CSHL cell type-dedicated BrainArchitecture web portal and through the BRAIN Cell Data Center (BCDC). !"
"9351483","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The B7 family consists of structurally related protein ligands, which bind to the CD28 family of receptors on lymphocytes to regulate the immune response via co-stimulatory or co-inhibitory signals. It is the engagement of the T-cell receptor with specific cell surface antigen that initiates the first step of lymphocyte activation, but an additional signal delivered simultaneously by B7 ligands determines the ultimate fate of the immune response. B7x (B7-H4 or B7S1), a poorly characterized B7 family member, is expressed on immune cells, non- lymphoid tissues, and nearly all human tumor types and acts to down-regulate immune responses by inhibiting cell cycle progression, proliferation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. B7x has been observed in cancer patients of nearly all types and this expression correlates positively with cancer staging, probability of recurrence, and negatively with survival, leading ultimately to poor clinicl outcomes. Currently, the mechanism B7x utilizes to generate inhibition of anti-tumor immunity remains elusive. The goal of this project is to reveal the physiological role of tumor expressed B7x in murine cancer models and generate anti-tumor immunity with a B7x-specific monoclonal antibody. We propose to accomplish these objectives by injecting B7x-positive and B7x-negative murine tumor cell lines into mice and monitoring the tumor growth and evolution of the immune reveal the physiological role of tumor expressed B7x in murine cancer models and generate anti-tumor immunity with a B7x-specific monoclonal antibody. We propose to accomplish these objectives by injecting B7x-positive and B7x-negative murine tumor cell lines into mice and monitoring the tumor growth and evolution of the immune response between both groups of mice. response between both groups of mice. We will then create a B7x-specific transgenic pancreatic cancer mouse model to evaluate the role of B7x in spontaneous tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we plan to evaluate the novelty of B7x as a target for immunotherapy by evaluating the efficacy of our newly generated anti-B7x specific monoclonal antibodies in generating anti- tumor immunity. We believe this project fully aligns with the missions of the National Cancer Institute because it will provide much needed insight into the mechanisms of B7x immune evasion in the cancer-associated pathway and highlights B7x as a viable and novel therapeutic target to increase overall improvement in patient outcome."
"9453124","Abstract  Immune checkpoint inhibitors have markedly improved overall survival in a number of cancers, which has in turn sparked tremendous scientific and financial investment into further expansion of this treatment paradigm. Currently, however, the benefits of immunotherapy have only been realized in a minority of patients. Further complicating the issue, many immunotherapies carry risks of severe adverse immune events, and methods to detect therapeutic efficacy such as anatomical staging and 18F-FDG PET imaging are confounded by the potential presence of immune infiltrate. These invading immune cells can cause potentially responding tumors to increase in size and in 18F-FDG consumption, which make them indistinguishable from progressing malignancies. Because of the lack of current diagnostic capabilities, the only option many patients undergoing immunotherapy have to determine if they are responding is overall survival, which is a long and potentially dangerous approach to determining therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, given the increasing number of drugs and combinations being clinically trialed, the ability to monitor therapeutic efficacy at an earlier stage would potentially help bring new treatments to approval much faster. Currently, there is no approved biomarker for determining therapeutic efficacy, and biopsy analysis of tumor markers such as PD-L1 prior to treatment have only resulted in modest improvements of outcome. Thus a biomarker that predicted response would permit significant advances in both the pre-clinical and clinical investigations.  Granzyme B, which is secreted by T effector cells following activation and acts as a potent inducer of apoptosis, is a strong predictor of immunotherapy response. I have developed a novel and selective PET imaging peptide that detects the secreted and active form of granzyme B, permitting differentiation between active response to immunotherapy and non-response in which ?exhausted? T cells that contain granzyme B may be present but are not actively secreting the enzyme. PET imaging with the granzyme B peptide permits highly sensitive and specific prediction of response to immunotherapy prior to changes in tumor volume in murine syngeneic models of cancer. This phenotype is not limited to mice, as human samples analyzed both by antibody and my peptide show significantly higher levels of granzyme B in responding versus non- responding patients. Thus, granzyme B PET imaging offers a unique insight into early response that is not currently possible using any other technique. Current methods cannot accurately define a response prior to destructive sampling, as a response is defined as lack of progression. Given these limitations, I am proposing to use granzyme B PET imaging to stratify mice based on granzyme B levels, followed by biochemical and genetic analysis of responding and non-responding tumors. The non-invasive nature of PET imaging will not only provide accurate differentiation of response prior to any anatomic changes, but will also allow for secondary therapeutic manipulations based on initial PET imaging results."
"9469261","Project Summary/Abstract Dysfunction of fronto-striatal circuits involving orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate nucleus (CN) have been implicated in a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders, including mood disorders [1-5], schizophrenia [6-9], and obsessive-compulsive disorder [10-15]. As development of novel pharmaceutical treatments for these disorders has stalled [16-18], focus has shifted to novel approaches, such as computational psychiatry [19], which seeks to explain neuropsychiatric diseases in terms of underlying computational processes. Several neuroimaging studies suggest that negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients are correlated with disruptions in fronto-striatal circuits involved in expected value signaling [20-22]. The current grant aims to understand which computations occur in the OFC-caudate cortico-striatal circuit as these regions translate reward- predictive cues into a decision. The proposed studies utilize electrophysiological and neural decoding methods during a behavioral task in which subjects choose between two alternatives. Our hypothesis is that, during binary choices, CN acts to integrate evidence for one or other choice response based on input from OFC ensembles as they vacillate between decodable states representing the two options. Once this evidence reaches some criterion, the choice response is implemented. We will test our hypothesis with the following two specific aims: Aim 1. Interaction between OFC and CN: translating value into action. We plan to record simultaneously from ensembles of OFC and CN neurons and use decoding algorithms to examine how the dynamics of the putative choice response signal in CN relates to OFC vacillation representing the two alternative outcomes. The value of these outcomes must be derived from two outcome properties: reward amount and reward probability. We will utilize GLM-based multi- label classification methods to examine how this value is represented, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to decode how a choice is signaled. Aim 2. Causal manipulation of choice response through closed-loop control. Our second aim focuses on testing the causal role of the computations output by OFC state fluctuations and CN integration in decision-making. We plan to decode OFC vacillation in real time and instruct the animal to make its response when the decoder is consistent with OFC representing either the high or low value option, and measure the behavioral effect of this manipulation on choice responses and reaction times. In other words, we will use the output of the OFC decoder to control the timing of the animal?s choice response, effectively closing the loop between neural activity and behavior."
"9565054","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Male sex workers (MSW), or men who exchange sex for money, drugs, or other items of value with other men, are at exceptionally high risk for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, truvada) is effective for reducing HIV acquisition among HIV uninfected individuals, but its efficacy is highly dependent on uptake and excellent adherence, which can pose problems among certain groups. Providence, Rhode Island (RI) is primed to be a site for testing of a PrEP initiation and adherence intervention for MSW, as it has a sizeable market for MSW (>1,000 street and internet based MSW). Additionally, Providence is the site of the nation's first drop-in center for MSW, called Project Weber, and is the site of one of the first clinical PrEP programs in the country, led by our team at Miriam Hospital/Brown University. Overview: Informed by our abundance of formative research and programmatic work with MSWs in the US, our interdisciplinary investigator team designed the PrEPare for Work package that includes two components: 1) peer-led strengths-based case management (SBCM) for PrEP initiation and 2) a counseling and problem-solving PrEP adherence intervention that addresses individualized barriers to optimal use. We propose to pilot test the PrEPare for Work package in two phases, laying the groundwork for a future R01 efficacy trial. We will: (Phase 1) conduct an open phase evaluation of PrEPare for Work. The intervention will be piloted with up to 10 MSW. Acceptability and feasibility data and participant exit interviews will be used to finalize all study procedures, questionnaire and intervention manual for use in the next phase; (Phase 2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PrEPare for Work using a two-stage randomization design. Stage 1: 106 MSW will be equally randomized to receive either the peer-led SBCM or standard of care (i.e., referrals only) for engagement with our existing PrEP clinic. Stage 2: Those from stage 1 who initiate PrEP (n~44), regardless of stage 1 randomization condition, will then be equally randomized to either the PrEPare for Work adherence intervention or standard of care comparison condition. In stage 1, the primary outcome is PrEP initiation (initial prescription filled, time-to-PrEP initiation). In stage 2, the primary outcomes are PrEP adherence (% of truvada-blood levels, hair samples, self-report) and retention in PrEP care at 6 months. Major study assessment visits are: for stage 1, baseline and 1-month follow up; for stage 2, baseline, 3-, and 6- months. Innovation: Evidence-based interventions to enhance uptake and optimize adherence of PrEP among at risk populations with complex life experiences must be developed and tested. This will ensure that individuals, such as MSW, who are most in need of PrEP, can benefit from its application. The current study would be the first of its kind with respect to packaging PrEP for MSW. By linking MSW to our team's existing PrEP program for ongoing PrEP clinical care, we will leverage existing infrastructure-enhancing the sustainability of the PrEPare for Work package, if shown to be effective in an eventual R01 efficacy RCT."
"9447276","ABSTRACT Type I interferons (IFNs) are increased in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) lesions and contribute to disease pathogenesis, yet skin-intrinsic sources of type I IFN have not been explored. Keratinocytes are the primary source of IFN kappa (?), a type I IFN that is a genetic risk factor for cutaneous lupus, significantly upregulated in CLE skin lesions, and is produced more robustly from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) vs. control keratinocytes. Importantly, neutralization of IFN? signaling eliminates hyper-inflammatory responses to ultraviolet light and toll-like receptor agonists in SLE keratinocytes. Thus, IFN? primes the abundant cutaneous inflammatory response in SLE. It is consequently critical to understand the regulation of IFN? and its role in regulation of inflammatory cytokine production and recruitment of cellular infiltrates as IFN? may prove to be a specific target for treatment or prevention of cutaneous lesions, and its specific inhibition may consequently avoid side effects from systemic blockade of other type I IFNs. The overall objective for this project is to define the mechanisms and consequences of aberrant regulation of IFN? in SLE skin. It is hypothesized that hyper- production of IFN? is a mechanism by which SLE keratinocytes are primed to overproduce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and consequently increase inflammatory responses and that IFN? will thus serve as a specific and viable target for prevention or treatment of SLE-associated skin lesions. The proposal will address this hypothesis through investigation of the following: Aim 1: Identify the mechanisms underlying increased production of IFN? in lupus keratinocytes. Regulation of IFN? by IFNs, STING signaling and methylation changes will be explored in control and SLE (including consideration of CLE subtypes) keratinocytes. Aim 2: Identify the mechanisms by which keratinocyte-produced IFN? promotes inflammatory responses. Effects of IFN? on keratinocyte IFN production, monocyte, dendritic cell, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell recruitment and activation in vitro and in vivo will be explored. Aim 3: Identify the in vivo impact of IFN? overexpression on cutaneous inflammation and systemic autoimmunity. Characterization of cutaneous and systemic autoimmunity and response to cutaneous inflammatory stimuli will be completed in a novel mouse that overexpresses IFN? in the epidermis. Completion of this work will support a paradigm shift in which keratinocyte-derived IFN? is recognized as an important step for priming and persistence of a hyper-inflammatory response in SLE skin and is identified as a specific target for future treatment and prevention of SLE-associated skin lesions."

Identifying relevant targets for  therapeutic intervention is difficult owing to the molecular and clinical heterogeneity of the disease. Through a  large body of work, we have demonstrated that blood-based transcriptomic profiling can be used to parse out  distinct transcriptional differences in immune function in health and disease. Relevant to the current application  are our studies showing that SLE can be divided into seven disease subgroups based on distinct blood  transcriptional signatures. More recently, we developed a sophisticated for integrated Profiling and Analysis  Pipeline (iPAP) that we used to identify meaningful epigenetic and transcriptomic differences in human  populations, including SLE cohorts. Building upon this knowledgebase will help us identify potential drivers of  the disease, and ultimately novel biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for SLE. We hypothesize that SLE  is comprised of a spectrum of disease subtypes that can be categorized according to mutually distinct  epigenomic, isoformic and transcriptomic features. The goal of this project is to characterize the repertoire  of immune cell isoforms and the epigenome profiles associated with three of the seven most frequent  pediatric SLE subgroups: SLE-Plasmablast (SLE-P), characterized by a plasmablast transcriptional signature  and the presence of increased circulating plasmablasts; SLE-Interferon/Myeloid cells (SLE-IM), which shows  an IFN and a neutrophil signature; and SLE-Plasmablast/ Interferon/Myeloid cells (SLE-PIM) displaying the  three main signatures. We will use novel experimental paradigms that incorporate cutting-edge genomic  technologies and build upon our established expertise in molecular immune profiling. Our project contains two  Specific Aims: 1) To analyze the alternatively spliced transcriptome of blood cells from the three SLE  patient subgroups, in which we will apply both short-read (Illumina HiSeq2500) and long-read (PacBio RSII)  sequencing technologies to interrogate the isoform repertoire of PBMCs and select immune cell subsets; and  2) To determine the epigenome of blood cells from the three SLE subgroups, through studies capitalizing  on a robust and sensitive new epigenomic assay called ATAC-seq coupled to Methyl-seq. Healthy age-  matched samples will be used as controls in all experiments and, we will also examine samples from children  with active juvenile dermatomyositis and systemic juvenile arthritis (n=5 per group), to identify those isoforms  and signatures unique to SLE from those more generally associated with autoimmunity. Our team includes  experts in immunology, genomics, epigenetics, systems biology of disease, computational biology, data  management and statistics, who bring the collective expertise necessary for generating top quality genomics  data and for robust data analysis using state-of-the-art methods. We will also create new tools, i.e., Nanostring  probes and monoclonal antibodies, for high throughout screening assays suited to large patient cohorts.  Successful completion of our project will reveal novel biomarkers of SLE and/or novel therapeutic targets.  "
"9447451","SUMMARY Anyone who has ever suffered a common cold knows that both taste and smell contribute to our experience of food. Understanding how smell and taste interact to ultimately drive food choice will make a major impact on our understanding of disorders that are typically characterized by abnormal food choice, most notably obesity and diabetes. The neural mechanisms underlying taste-smell interactions, however, remain largely unknown, and are the focus of the present proposal. The proposed work follows directly from existing behavioral and neuro- physiological data. Behavioral work has demonstrated an influence of taste on smell in flavor preference for- mation. Recent work from our own lab has identified a potential neural substrate for mediating the influence of taste on smell by demonstrating that primary olfactory cortex (OC) receives gustatory input via primary gustatory cortex (GC). Using rats as a model system, the present proposal will combine naturalistic multisensory stimulus presentation, optogenetics and electrophysiological recordings in the context of a flavor preference learning task to investigate the role of interactions between the primary gustatory and olfactory systems in mediating multi- sensory flavor preference learning. Specific Aim 1 will use anatomical tracing, optogenetic manipulation of GC neuron axon terminals in OC, and electrophysiological mapping experiments to dissect the systems- and circuit- level organization of gustatory input to OC. Preliminary data suggest the existence of monosynaptic projections from GC to OC. Specific Aim 2 will then record activity from single OC neurons in response to uni- and multi- sensory flavor stimuli to characterize convergence and integration of flavor-related gustatory and olfactory input. Preliminary data suggest that taste and smell inputs to OC are integrated through functional, spatial and temporal convergence on single OC neurons. Specific Aim 3 will place the network relaying gustatory input to OC in the context of a taste-mediated flavor preference learning task to determine the causal role GC?OC projections in modulating odor representations and forming flavor preferences. Preliminary data suggest that multisensory ex- perience induces lasting changes in OC odor responses. The results obtained from these experiments will pro- vide novel insight into how OC functions in a natural, behaviorally-relevant multisensory context, specifically uncovering the mechanisms underlying taste-smell interactions in flavor perception and preference formation."
"9386343","Summary Transgenic sickle mice offer unparalleled opportunities to rigorously examine mechanisms of sickle cell disease in a controlled experimental model. Among the most commonly studied are mice expressing mouse globin chains along with human HbS, including NY1DD and S+SAnt. These models show modest or no chronic anemia. Commonly used mouse models that express human HbS without mouse alpha and beta globin chains are BERK and Townes transgenic sickle mice. Of the two the Townes sickle transgenic models is ?knock-in? model where human alpha and beta-globin genes are inserted (knocked-in) in place of mouse globin genes chains. These two models exhibit severe features of sickle cell disease including hematologic disease, organ damage and shortened life span similar to the clinical disease. Both Townes and BERK homozygous mice exhibit inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial activation, similar to the pathobiology reported for patients with sickle cell disease. Both of these mice appear to be suitable models to analyze a variety of complications seen in sickle cell disease. There has not previously been any colony of the sickle mouse model established in any institution in Africa. This technological limitation invariably puts African scientists at a major disadvantage in contributing knowledge to advancing our understanding of a disorder that is most prevalent on their continent. There is a similar dearth in genomics technology generally on the African continent, which compounds the aforementioned limitation. The PI of this application has widespread experience in human molecular genomics, hematology and transgenic sickle mouse technology. The PI has established stable colonies of the Townes' transgenic sickle mouse model at Emory University and more recently at the University of Pittsburgh. The colony at the University of Pittsburgh has grown to become one of the largest in the world, and a useful resource not only for investigators in the University of Pittsburgh, but for also for investigators in other US institutions. The PI will leverage the sickle mouse colony at the University of Pittsburgh to establish the first colony of sickle cell mice in Africa, at the University of Ghana's Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research as a shared scientific core facility of the SickleGenAfrica H3Africa Collaborative Center. The goals of the three research projects of the H3Africa Collaborative Center are to define the genome-wide genetic risk factors of organ dysfunction in multiple organ systems in SCD. While each project is planning to replicate genetic associations discovered in one African population (e.g. West Africans), in a cohort of patients from at least one different part of the continent (e.g. East Africa), the findings will nonetheless remain correlative. The sickle mouse core will offer investigators and students in Ghana and in the other participating sites (e.g. Nigeria) the first opportunity to functionally validate such associations in an established model animal. !"
"9386631","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rodents are important tools for studying kidney function and diseases. However, expertise and equipment for physiological analysis of kidney function in mice are not readily available to many investigators in the renal research community, and even less so outside the renal community. Furthermore, production of mutant mice has allowed many investigators outside the renal community to uncover unexpected renal phenotypes and venture into renal research. The objective of the Physiology Core is to assist investigators with a wide range of physiological techniques to study kidney physiology and diseases at the cellular, organ, and importantly, whole animal level. This Core serves the three major themes of the O'Brien Center of Renal Development and Genetics, Physiology and Pathophysiology, Chronic Kidney Disease and tis Complications. To achieve these objectives, the Core will provide specific assistances: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.

"9416006","PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT A comprehensive understanding neuronal cell type diversity is an essential guide to selective manipulation and illuminating cell type specific functional contributions toward health and disease. Accordingly, the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) is unifying the efforts of laboratories with unique expertise in anatomy, genetics, electrophysiology, and function to classify neurons and create a common 3D atlas with integrated cell type data. To this end, our proposed collaboratory aims to anatomically characterize neuronal cell types of the mouse limbic system. Using mesoscale quadruple retrograde tracing, we will initially characterize cell types based on the anatomical location of their connectional start and end points [e.g., ACB(contralateral)?BLAa?ACB(ipsilateral)]. A two-step cre-dependent AAV tracing strategy using advanced viral tools will subsequently validate and refine specific axonal projections, collaterals, and projection fields [e.g., ACB/X/Y?BLAa?ACB/X/Y]. Injections of G-deleted rabies in CLARITY-processed tissue will label morphological features of cell types. Cre-dependent TRIO viral tracing will determine discrete inputs to each cell type, providing deeper characterization of connectivity. Novel TRIO using flp recombinase in cre- dependent mice will define projection patterns of genetically-defined cell types. Newly constructed AAV and rabies viruses tagged to spaghetti monster fluorescent proteins, applied in combination with Expansion Microscopy and multiphoton imaging, will determine the spatial organization of different synaptic inputs to the cell types. Collectively, experiments will reveal cell type anatomic location, morphology, and comprehensive connectivity. Initial efforts will focus on the limbic system, with the design extensible to neuronal characterization of the entire brain. A web-based visualization platform will be developed to enable viewing and analysis of cell type anatomy data in 2D and 3D. An online visualization tool similar in function to our iConnectome viewer will present quadruple retrograde and TRIO tracing images. Digitized, reconstructed quadruple retrograde, cre-AAV, and TRIO labeling will be placed atop the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) to create an online 2D connectivity map, allowing easy comparison of cell type specific inputs and outputs. Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) registration and reconstruction of cre-AAV labeling experiments will provide the cell type specific 3D context of projections, with input and morphological information integrated into the viewer. An interactive, weighted and directed matrix will present an intuitive visualization of all connectivity data. 3D reconstructed neurons will also be hosted on Neuromorpho.org for interspecies comparison. Our current informatics pipelines will be extended and optimized to support the proposed viewer features. We expect our technologies to elucidate diverse cell type specific networks and provide foundations for the overarching goal of the BICCN of creating a comprehensive 3D cell type atlas."
"9257146","Project Summary/Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects more than 1 million Americans and has been increasing in prevalence in the last decade. IBD consists of two diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which are both characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and can manifest with similar symptoms. Despite their similarities, the diseases are very heterogeneous and consist of complex interactions between the immune system, the microbiome, and the affected tissue. Characterizing the two diseases at the molecular level has been met with limited success, and the lack of a clear mechanistic pathway has resulted in the lack of efficacy of existing treatments in subsets of IBD patients. Previous methods have focused primarily on gene enrichment analysis, but these studies have shown inconsistent results and do not offer mechanistic insights into disease development. Systems pharmacological methods offer several advantages over traditional gene-based approaches by using networks to characterize relationships between genes, which enables the application of powerful analyses using graph theory. These methods enable us to use the topology of protein interaction networks to elucidate disease mechanisms and characterize network perturbations caused by drugs. Furthermore, with the advent of cheaper and more accurate modalities to quantify molecular profiles and the increasing availability of molecular data, we now have the ability to leverage multiple data sources to create a multifaceted approach to understanding the mechanism of IBD. Thus, by combining protein-protein interaction data, drug target data, and drug perturbation data, we aim to (1) construct personalized molecular networks for UC and CD, (2) develop a supervised network method to model drug effects, and (3) identify and validate novel drugs for treatment responders and nonresponders. With success, we will have the ability to distinguish treatment responders from nonresponders and have identified potential novel drug candidates to treat IBD. Furthermore, we will have a more thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IBD, which will enable the development of more effective therapies to alleviate the suffering of millions worldwide."
"9419084","Full Research Project 1: Survivorship Care Physical Activity Initiative to Reduce Disparities in HRQOL for Prostate Cancer Survivors (RELate Study) SUMMARY The late effects of prostate cancer (PCa) treatment can lead to unique physical and psychosocial issues that impact their long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Increased physical activity (PA) is a modifiable risk factor which may be targeted to address PCa survivorship-related treatment outcomes and lifestyle behaviors. Increased PA may have greatest impact on outcomes for African-ancestry (AA) PCa survivors, who tend to have lower HRQOL and overall survival, and in whom factors such as a lack of exercise, poor diet, and rates of obesity are most prevalent. While it is well-known that exercise can improve prognosis among cancer survivors, little is known about the bio-behavioral mechanisms and pathways through which PA may improve HRQOL and increase overall survival. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are reactive metabolites produced during normal metabolism as well as the oxidation of biological macromolecules. Lifestyle factors such as a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and obesity increase AGE levels in the body. The investigators hypothesize that in a randomized trial of a human PA/dietary intervention with PCa survivors previously diagnosed with Stage I-III PCa (n=120), lower AGE levels will correlate with improved HRQOL, and will lead to differential changes in immune response between AA and European American (EA) trial participants. The investigators further hypothesize that in a mouse model intervention, the mechanistic implications of lifestyle- associated AGEs to tumor-associated immune response and tumor growth and/or progression will mimic those found in human models. Aim 1 is to complete a 1-year, 2-arm (intervention vs usual care) randomized PA/dietary intervention in men diagnosed with stage I-III PCa (co-led by Dr. M. Ahmed, SCSU and Dr. D. Turner, MUSC-HCC). Aim 2 is to evaluate the effect of lifestyle intervention on PA and diet, and define their relationship with AGEs, AGEs pre-cursors, and HRQOL in men diagnosed with stage I-III PCa (led by Dr. Ahmed, SCSU). Aim 3 is to use a spontaneous PCa lifestyle mouse model to define the role of AGE-RAGE signaling to immune-cell phenotypes and tumor progression (led by Dr. Turner, MUSC-HCC). The results could lead to innovative insights for pharmacologic and lifestyle adjustment, and could identify protective factors that may underlie observed differences in PCa treatment outcomes between AA and EA men. This project is synergistically related to the other research projects included in this application"
"9484896","MOLINA PROJECT ABSTRACT  Obesity is an epidemic that disproportionately impacts Latino youth: by ages 6-11, 26.1% of Latino youth are  obese compared to 13.1% of whites. Recently, the unequal distribution of structural violence?in the form of  stress manifesting from direct or residual effect of racism?to which parents of color are exposed, is  increasingly being recognized as a key contributor of childhood disparities in obesity. Data from the Hispanic  Community Health Study/Study of Latinos indicated that nearly 80% of Latinos reported experiencing lifetime  discrimination. Evidence, albeit limited, finds that stress in Latino parents is associated with increased risk of  obesity in Latino youth. However, little is known regarding the ways in which different forms of structural  violence co-occur and intersect in Latino parents. Further, given this gap, it is not known how distinct  configurations of exposure to structural violence among parents are associated with child obesity, nor the  potential mechanisms underlying this association. To address these knowledge gaps, we will conduct a  secondary data analysis of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Youth Study  (N=1,310), a cross-sectional multisite observational study of obesity and cardiometabolic risk among U.S.  Hispanic/Latino children and their caregivers. We propose to use latent profile analysis and structural equation  modeling to accomplish the following aims: (1) identify and characterize subtypes of structural violence present  among Latino parents; and (2) determine which parental structural violence subtypes are associated with child  BMI percentile, and the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms that may underlie these  associations. Successful completion of these goals will provide necessary preliminary data for a R01  continuation grant. Further, findings from this study will facilitate our understanding of the patterning of  structural violence in Latino parents; associations with and relative importance to child BMI, and identifying  potential modifiable mechanisms at different levels. Latinos are the youngest racial/ethnic group and Latino  youth are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. child population. If the obesity epidemic among Latino youth  is not reversed, the felt social, economic, and health toll will be great not just for the individual, but also for their  families, communities, and the nation as a whole. Thus, our ultimate goal is to generate information about the  characteristics of parental structural violence subtypes in Latino parents whose children may be at greatest risk  of obesity. This in turn will help guide clinical practice and inform the development of targeted preventive  interventions needed to reduce the burden of structural violence in Latino parents and of obesity in Latino  youth."

"9433396","Project Summary The overall objective is to develop and test a novel rehabilitative training program for central auditory dysfunction after traumatic brain injury. Solutions designed to enhance auditory processing when hearing thresholds are within normal limits are very limited and none are as recognized or as widely available as are hearing aids and cochlear implants. While there exist some contemporary approaches devised to improve hearing in a variety of populations, these are largely based upon emulating hearing scenarios in the environment. While such programs show some efficacy, three key limitations undermine the overall effectiveness and deployment of these approaches. 1) A lack of alignment of treatments with up-to-date knowledge of how sounds are processed by the brain 2). A lack of alignment of treatments with up-to-date knowledge of perceptual learning research, and 3) Difficulty in getting patients to comply with training procedures that are often frustrating and boring. Here we aim to overcome these limitations by integrating contemporary knowledge of auditory neuroscience, perceptual learning, and modern game design to develop and test novel auditory training therapies. Our primary premise is that 1) Studies of auditory neuroscience and psychoacoustics have advanced our understanding of the function of auditory processes beyond the cochlea. 2) Studies of perceptual learning have advanced our understanding of plasticity in the neural systems underlying hearing, and have refined behavioral procedures that engage these systems. 3) Commercial video games have become ubiquitous, sophisticated, and shaped by competitive market pressures to become both perceptually engaging (rich graphics, sounds, and animations) and cognitively challenging. Combining these elements can lead to behavioral cognitive therapies that are effective and encourage compliance by being compelling, stimulating, and fun. We will test an adaptive training program that involves practice with a ?basis set? of spectral temporal modulated sounds that are modeled after auditory neuron receptive field properties7 combined with interaural localization cues to also train sound source segregation. Efficacy will then be tested in normal hearing participants and in patients with mild traumatic brain injury and auditory processing difficulties (APDs) and compared against active tone training controls. Outcome measures are tests of real world audition including; speech in noise, multiple talker environments and auditory attention and working memory. Potential for knowledge gain and translational impact is substantial. This project will result in techniques and data relevant to rehabilitation of APDs. The data and training will be made available to the clinical and research community. Evidence of efficacy will be followed upon with a R01 proposal to examine how different components of training contribute to observed effects and to examine neural underpinnings. The positive impact whether or not the training program is effective will be new knowledge about what types of training programs are effective, and which are not, and can contribute to development of effective therapies for APDs."

The program includes Developmental Research and Career Development Programs, Biospecimen Resource and Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Cores that support the translational research needs of all investigators in the YSPORE. The YSPORE is led by an Administration Core that coordinates and manages the program on a daily basis. One of the overriding themes of the YSPORE is to reveal biomarkers and targets for therapy based on Information from Next-Generation (Next-Gen) DNA sequencing, genomics and proteomics analyses. This approach will be used to identify: 1) regions of the genome that are sensitive indicators of long-term accumulation of DNA damage and mutations resulting from sunlight exposure; and 2) the molecular basis of resistance of melanomas to targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). We will use structure function analyses to identify druggable targets in resistant cells (Project 3) and in a novel RAC1 pathway that we have identified in melanoma (Project 4). Project 2 is dedicated to one of the most promising immunotherapy for melanoma, anti PD-1, and is focused on tumor/stroma interactions to reveal mechanism of evasion of cancer immunity. The studies in this project should have direct impact for current development of B7-H1/PD-1 blockade as a novel and promising approach for melanoma therapy. The expected translational outcomes of the program are: 1) Development of biological indicators for sun exposure risk to be used in melanoma prevention; 2) The identification of predictive biomarkers for therapeutic blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and the role of this pathway in resistance to other types of immunotherapy, leading to potentially more effective combination immunotherapy; 3) The development of molecular tests that will guide treatment for BRAFi; 4) The classification of melanoma according to therapeutic options based on mutations in 'driver' pathway; 5) identification of small molecule that can target the RAC1 pathway; 6) The implementation of new national initiatives such as the CaTISSUE, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the MRF National Consortium for melanoma clinical trials."

This proposed conference?hosted by the Cancer Therapy and Research Center, an NCI-designated cancer center, and the Institute for Health Promotion Research at UT Health San Antonio?represents the first-ever international conference focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities among Latino communities. Although there has been substantial progress in cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment over the past several decades, progress has not kept pace among certain population regarding health disparities, such as differences in access to care, less frequent use of proven screening tests, higher rates of advanced cancer diagnoses and higher mortality rates. Latinos in particular are among the groups with the highest rate of new cancer cases in the US. As the issue of disparities in Latinos has gained more attention in cancer research and public health communities, it has become apparent that collaboration among trans-professionals is needed. This conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of professionals to address cancer health disparities in Latinos on numerous fronts, from basic research on biological differences behind disparities to community-level interventions that aim to overcome barriers to cancer care and address the unique needs of Latino populations. This special conference will celebrate the advances researchers have made to date, and explore new frontiers and gaps in this emerging transdisciplinary field, bringing research on health disparities from bench to bedside to community. This conference will support the following aims:  ? Promote collaboration among trans-professionals in addressing cancer health disparities  in Latinos;  ? Discuss latest findings in the field, identify critical gaps in current knowledge, and  stimulate development of new research in cancer health disparities among Latinos; and  ? Identify and publish the top 10 priorities of greatest significance to Latinos based on  discussions from the conference, as well as recommendations for a research agenda."

"9410007","Project summary Key biophysical properties such as drug binding sites and enzyme catalysis arise can be computer-modeled using quantum mechanics, but limitations in the accuracy of practical quantum methods have held back progress. Over the past five years, this situation has changed with exciting, (and ongoing) improvements in the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). New and better density functionals open new opportunities for applications in conformational searching, molecular recognition, ligand binding, and all the areas where ab initio calculations are employed in biophysical chemistry. However, these functionals require very large and computationally demanding basis sets to attain their high accuracy. Use of smaller basis sets leads to unconverged results with often unacceptable errors. There is an unmet need to significantly reduce the computational cost of achieving large basis set accuracy.  The central innovation of this proposal is to use minimal adaptive basis functions (MAB) for this purpose, in place of traditional large basis sets. The MAB is a small (minimal) set of functions, adaptively formed from a traditional large basis via an atom-blocked, sparse transformation. The DFT calculation is performed in the adaptive basis, followed by a dual basis correction. This potentially permits very large computational speedups, while yielding accuracy virtually indistinguishable from a computationally costly calculation performed conventionally in the large target basis.  The Phase I research has three principal objectives. First, the research will establish the accuracy of the MAB protocol for a range of biophysically relevant energy differences. Second, the research will lead to a carefully justified estimate of the speed-up that is attainable with the MAB approach, and will produce a new software implementation of several of the algorithmic steps that must be optimized. Third, modifications and improvements of the MAB approach will be sought as possible and needed. The results will lay the groundwork for basis set limit DFT calculations at greatly reduced computational cost, thereby potentially greatly expanding their usefulness for biophysical modeling."
"9408208","Abstract  PrEP is a powerful and potentially groundbreaking HIV prevention strategy, but its public health impact will depend on widescale adoption by persons at greatest risk for contracting HIV infection. PrEP awareness and use remain especially low among African American MSM in mid-sized cities across the center of the country, and very little research has tested interventions that can increase PrEP awareness, benefit perception, and normative support?and decrease PrEP stigma and concerns?among African American MSM in these cities. PrEP can achieve its full public health potential only when its uptake among racial minority MSM in neglected mid-sized American cities is increased. In prior research, our team established that network-level interventions can reach and be used to deliver effective HIV risk reduction interventions to Black MSM in the industrial Midwest, including hard-to-reach men hidden in the community. The planned mixed- methods research will now evaluate a network intervention to increase PrEP uptake among high-risk African American MSM in Milwaukee and Cleveland, cities where HIV racial disparities are profound but PrEP use is low. In a formative research phase, in-depth interviews will be conducted with African American MSM, PrEP providers, and other key informants in each city to identify understandings, concerns, barriers, and facilitators of PrEP use. In the main intervention trial phase, 36 social networks of high-risk racial minority MSM (expected n=504 participants) will be enrolled, 18 networks per city, by recruiting high-risk initial ?seeds,? members of each seed's MSM friendship network, and then two outward successive rings of their friends. All study participants will receive baseline counseling for PrEP and risk reduction. The 36 networks will then be randomized in equal numbers to intervention and comparison conditions. In each intervention condition network, a cadre of network leaders open to PrEP, trusted for advice, and highly interconnected with others will attend an intervention that educates and then provides training and guidance in diffusing messages to friends to encourage PrEP uptake, correcting PrEP misconceptions and stigma, and instilling positive PrEP norms and benefit perceptions. At baseline and 6- and 15-month followup points, participants will complete measures of PrEP use corroborated by the testing of dried blood spot specimens for tenofovir; measures of PrEP related knowledge, attitudes, perceived norms, and stage of change readiness; sexual risk practices; and substance use. We hypothesize that the network intervention will produce greater PrEP adoption by HIV- participants than that found in comparison networks. PrEP knowledge, attitudes, intentions, peer norms, and stage of change readiness will be explored as both mediators and as secondary outcomes. Intervention effects on HIV incidence will be mathematically modeled to determine its public health impact. This research will test a novel approach for increasing PrEP use among neglected racial minority MSM in mid-sized American cities who can best?and can perhaps only?be reached through their social network connections."
"9432081","Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Satiro De Oliveira, M.D. is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at UCLA with research interests in biology of transplantation and cancer immunotherapy. His long-term goals are to bring cellular therapy approaches to standard clinical practice. His mentor, Dr. Donald Kohn, M.D., is highly qualified and internationally recognized gene therapy exponent and mentor. A Scientific Advisory Committee has been assembled to combine excellent mentorship skills and expertise in cancer immunotherapy and non- Hodgkin lymphoma to provide guidance for the career development and research plan. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are the fifth most prevalent cancer in the US; patients with refractory or recurrent NHL have less than 50% of chance of cure. The main goal of this proposal is to use gene modification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) targeting CD19, a molecule present in the majority of the NHL. CAR are synthetic chimeric proteins composed of the antigen-recognition portion of a monoclonal antibody fused to intracellular signaling domains able to activate immune cells. CAR-modification of HSC brings the prospect of long-term persistence and CAR expression in multiple hematopoietic lineages, amplifying graft-versus-lymphoma activity; CAR+ HSC could be infused in the context of standard autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A robust in vivo model of humanized NSG mice engrafted with anti-CD19-CAR-modified HSC has been recently published by Dr. De Oliveira. Detailed evaluation of this approach will lead to a first-in-human clinical trial. A key feature of this K23 application is the use of paired samples of HSC and NHL tumors from patients, with correlation to their demographics, expression of membrane proteins on tumor cells, clinical data and therapeutic outcomes. The scientific questions addressed in this proposal are: Aim 1. Will CAR-modified HSC lead to lasting immunological memory and persistent anti-cancer activity? 1.1. Comparative evaluation of CD28 and 4-1BB co-stimulatory molecules in the anti-CD19 CAR constructs used for modification of human HSC. 1.2. Evaluation of anti-CD19 activity in mice engrafted with CAR-modified human HSC at multiple time-points and after serial tumor challenges. 1.3. Evaluation of the generation of memory T cell subsets from CAR-modified human HSC in mice compared to adoptively transferred CAR-modified human T cells. Aim 2. How robust is the protection of CAR-modified HSC against CD19+ NHL primary tumors? 2.1. Evaluation of humanization of NSG mice with gene-modified HSC from B cell NHL patients. 2.2. Characterization of the phenotype of primary NHL tumor cells using mass cytometry (CyTOF). 2.3. Evaluation of anti-lymphoma activity in humanized mice challenged with primary B cell NHL tumors."
"9276255","PROJECT SUMMARY  Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are complex diseases with undiscovered  genetic factors. We successfully discovered a deleterious variant in VSIG10L segregating in a large family. This  is the first such reported gene for susceptibility to BE and EAC. VSIG10L appears to function in adhesion and  differentiation/maturation of stratified squamous epithelium. Further clues for a genetic basis comes from our  admixture mapping study, which has identified two specific chromosomal regions associated with excess  European ancestry in African Americans. The BETRNet focus of Project 1 is thus to identify the genetic basis of  racial disparity in the prevalence of BE and EAC. A second BETRNet focus of Project 1 is to create a genetically  engineered mouse model based on VSIG10L to understand the transformation from squamous epithelium to  metaplastic Barrett's epithelium. This project will now build on these discoveries by:   1) Using dense SNP genotyping, NextGen sequencing, and ATAC-seq to identify racially disparate genetic   variants that explain racial differences in prevalence of BE and EAC;   2) Using genetically engineered VSIG10L knockout and VSIG10L S631G variant carrying mice to   understand how VSIG10L contributes to the normal squamous epithelium ? esophagitis ? BE   metaplasia ? dysplasia ? cancer progression;  The significance of Project 1 is first to translate the clinical observation of racial disparity in BE and EAC into the  laboratory to identify a causative genetic basis. Furthermore, the project will build on our successful discovery of  the first familial susceptibility genetic variant by understanding how this gene functions in metaplastic  transformation of Barrett's epithelium."

"9450432","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs) experience a disproportionately higher prevalence and earlier onset of cardiometabolic health outcomes, including Type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), than other racial/ethnic groups. These health disparities may result from the social environment shaping an individual?s health behaviors (e.g. nutrition, physical activity, and education) and physiological responses that may mediate gene-environment interactions. The detrimental effects of social environments may include an increase in systemic inflammation, a hallmark of cardiometabolic diseases where monocytes of the immune system play a major role. We observed neighborhood social environments that associated with inflammation in vulnerable populations. Additionally, other studies show that monocyte- mediated inflammation leads to insulin resistance in target cells and heightened risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, regulate transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in monocytes. We posit that neighborhood social environment leads to global changes in DNA methylation states in immune cells associated with cardiometabolic disease risk. In our work, we observed significant genome-wide changes to DNA methylation and gene expression states of pro-inflammatory genes that associated with monocyte inflammatory activity and glycemic control in DM patients, and a robust DNA methylomic signature of insulin resistance in monocytes that correlated with CVD risk. Together, these data suggest that cardiometabolic diseases may in part result from social environment-induced changes to the epigenomic landscape in monocytes underlying their inflammatory states. In this study, we will address whether the neighborhood social environment impacts epigenomic variability in monocytes across different ethnic populations in Hawaii and account for cardiometabolic health disparities, specifically to that of DM in NHs/PIs. To do so, we propose to integrate detailed individual-level health behavior, clinical/immunologic, genetic, and monocyte-specific epigenomic data with neighborhood-level social environment data from our Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). By using a population-based prospective study with viably preserved cells, we will have an unprecedented opportunity to examine the translational utility of epigenomic information in predicting clinically diagnosed DM that occurred during a 20-year follow-up. As NHs/PIs have disproportionately high rates of DM, we anticipate an increased frequency of an immunoepigenetic signature predictive of DM outcomes, which would provide novel insight into the etiology of health disparities. Therefore, we believe our social epigenomic multiethnic study meets the overall goals of this FOA to advance the science of epigenomics focused on health disparities, expand approaches for understanding epigenetic mechanisms by which social factors lead to biological changes that affect health disparities, and promote epigenetics research to better diagnose disease risk or resiliency among disadvantaged populations."
"9382407","Neighborhood context may be an upstream cause of economic mobility, yet few neighborhood studies are experimental, weakening causal inference and limiting policy translation. Our study proposes to analyze newly- available data from a large, federal government initiated social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 US cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study). Our project will test whether, how, and among whom random assignment of an offer to move to a lower-poverty neighborhood influenced the economic mobility of 4600 low-income families over a 15 year period. The goal of MTO was to interrupt the cascading effects of neighborhood poverty for minority low-income families, by increasing area- based access to opportunities, and thereby promote economic mobility. Although the MTO voucher intervention did not consistently affect economic outcomes, it did profoundly affect health. Unfortunately, health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. So as of yet, we have no clear understanding of why results might differ across outcomes, groups, or what mechanisms are at play, since few studies have tested mediation or moderation. Since health is one of the most important barriers to economic self-sufficiency among low-income parents, it is conceivable that economic and employment gains were concentrated among families who first experienced health improvements. However testing whether factors that occurred after random assignment are precursors for other outcomes is methodologically challenging. Fortunately, recent methodological developments in the epidemiology discipline offer cogent solutions to model this complexity and bound any bias. We propose secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this experiment, to test whether health influenced the economic effects of the randomized MTO housing voucher treatment. Paired with this experimental design, we propose to apply innovative causal methods and machine learning techniques for assessing mediation and effect modification, to overcome limitations and potential bias of traditional approaches, and strengthen causal inference. Our R01 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO data, and draws on a barriers-to-employment framework. We propose 4 aims to determine: whether the effect of MTO on economic outcomes was modified by baseline health vulnerability; whether MTO improved parental economic outcomes, if they or their children experienced health gains; whether MTO improved children?s employment and education, if they experienced health gains; whether MTO improved economic outcomes, if families moved to neighborhoods with fewer spatial barriers to employment. Our findings have direct policy relevance since they address a key policy question in housing voucher implementation: incorporating elements from non-housing sectors (e.g., health, employment, education) to promote moves to higher opportunity neighborhoods, to ultimately improve outcomes for low income families."

"9448270","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term cognitive and behavioral deficits are the sequelae of iron deficiency (ID) prior to 3 years of age in children. A causal relationship between early-life ID and brain dysfunction has been established in rodent models, but not as clearly in humans due to a lack of peripheral biomarkers of brain iron status and function. Using a nonhuman primate model that closely mimics human iron biology, brain development and metabolism, we propose to discover novel biomarkers that index brain dysfunction in the pre-anemic stage of ID and evaluate the efficacy of early iron treatment for mitigating ID-induced brain dysfunction. We will serially measure from birth until 12 months, conventional hematological and iron-related indices, and novel proteomic- and metabolomic-based biomarkers in the blood (serum) and intrathecal (CSF) compartments of ID infants and iron sufficient control infants, concluding with neuroanatomical (MRI) and functional (behavior) assessments.  Aim 1 will determine how best to employ serum proteomics and metabolomics to detect impending ID- induced brain dysfunction by delineating which analytes and when in the course of ID, the serum proteome and metabolome accurately reflect the brain metabolic, structural and functional impairments. We predict that specific protein and metabolite changes reflecting distinct iron-regulated pathways will be detected in the serum in the pre-anemic period and provide biomarkers of impending brain dysfunction. Aim 2 will quantify and model the sensitivity of conventional hematological and serum iron parameters for detecting brain dysfunction by serially monitoring these parameters relative to the metabolomic and proteomic indices of brain dysfunction in concurrently obtained CSF. We predict that brain ID and dysfunction will be evident prior to the appearance of anemia, indicating that hematological parameters used in clinical practice are insensitive as biomarkers of brain iron and metabolic status. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that iron treatment prior to anemia is essential to mitigate the adverse neurological effects of ID. ID infants will be randomized to iron treatment either in the pre-anemic stage of ID or after the development of anemia. The efficacy of the two therapies for restoring hematological indices and brain iron status, metabolism, structure and function will be determined. We predict that both treatments will normalize hematological indices, but only iron treatment begun in the pre-anemic stage will fully restore brain iron status, metabolism, structure and function. This project is significant, because it focuses on the benefits of early screening and interventions for improving the neurodevelopment of children at risk for early-life ID. It is innovative because it will employ novel proteomic and metabolomic analyses to simultaneously probe the blood and intrathecal compartments in a primate model that uniquely mimics the iron and metabolic demands of the human infant. The discovery of functional biomarkers will achieve our ultimate translational goal of optimizing screening and treatment strategies in children at risk for early-life brain ID."
"9449960","Engaging communities in research is critical for reducing and, in time, eliminating health disparities among  racial and ethnic minorities, and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.

"9328773","Project Summary/Abstract Idiopathic immune myopathies are a group of disorders causing chronic damage to skeletal muscle due to extensive inflammation triggered by an autoimmune response. This chronic inflammation state leads to degeneration of muscle structure and function resulting in severe proximal muscle weakness. T cell- and antibody-mediated processes are known to be involved in the progression of disease, however, the mechanism leading to pathogenesis remains unknown. Current treatment options for myositis are minimal and focus on the use of broad-spectrum immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids. While these treatments exhibit a degree of efficacy for the acute management of myositis, systemic suppression of the immune system often leads to significant complications. This project will examine the contribution of sarcolemmal membrane repair to the pathogenesis of myositis. The membrane repair response is initiated by the influx of extracellular calcium at the site of injury. This influx triggers trafficking of intracellular vesicles to the sarcolemmal membrane, thereby forming a patch that restores membrane barrier function and allows the injured cell to survive. Our work has helped to identify TRIM72 (also known as MG53), a member of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family of intracellular proteins, as a critical component of the membrane repair process. Our preliminary studies identified novel autoantibodies against TRIM proteins yet to be associated with myositis and identified increases in TRIM protein expression levels in human myositis skeletal muscle biopsies. We also find that antibodies against TRIM72 can compromise membrane repair. Our driving hypothesis is defects in membrane repair associated with the progression of myositis lead to TRIM protein exposure to the extracellular space and that the autoantibodies produced against TRIM proteins further compromise membrane repair and exacerbate inflammation. We propose to test this hypothesis using three specific aims. Aim 1 defines the mechanistic role of TRIM72 antigen presentation on membrane fragility associated with myositis. Aim 2 determines if autoantibodies against skeletal muscle proteins linked to the membrane repair process are sufficient to compromise membrane repair. Aim 3 evaluates the efficacy of increasing membrane repair capacity as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat myositis. These studies should allow us move towards our long term goal is to improve clinical outcomes for patients suffering from idiopathic immune myopathies such as myositis by elucidating the mechanisms leading to chronic inflammation and muscle degeneration. This would allow for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for myositis."
"9406414","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT PROJECT IV: GENOMIC ANALYSES The overall theme of the Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center (CLDRC) is that multiple different learning disabilities ? including reading disability, math disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ? frequently occur in the same individual as a result of deficits that affect multiple underlying functional domains. Some of these deficits affect a single domain such as phonological processing, and some affect multiple domains such as phonological processing and attention and processing speed. In the projects within the CLDRC, these functional domains will be characterized by their genetic and developmental characteristics and by their interactions with an individual?s environment. In Project IV, we focus on the genetic characteristics of these functional domains at the molecular level through several approaches. We hypothesize that some genetic variants specifically affect a single domain while other genetic variants affect multiple domains. To identify these genetic variants, we will continue our studies of CLDRC families through targeted sequencing in chromosomal regions in which we find genetic effects in a specific domain, and we will extend our search for genetic variants that have effects on multiple domains. We will modify methods for generating a learning disability risk score, based on genome-wide variation, that could be clinically useful and widely applicable regardless of race, ethnicity or sex. We will also examine individual and shared brain circuits that are critical for learning. We will identify the genes that help to determine how well these circuits are formed and function, and will relate these circuits and genes to the functional domains that they serve. Finally, in partnership with an on- going intervention trial for reading disability called the New Haven Lexinome Project, we will examine the genetic basis for differential rates of acquisition of reading skill, the influence of attention, and the interactions between the genetic and the environmental (instruction) effects in an ethnically diverse population of public school children. The overall goal of Project IV is to disentangle the individual and shared genetic, neurobiological, and environmental factors that underlie learning disabilities, and to foster development of useful strategies for diagnosis, for informing effective remediation and for developing interventions."

Gleevec treatment is commonly accompanied by significant, burdensome gastrointestinal side effects that erode therapy success due to poor patient compliance. Inhibikase's prodrug of Gleevec completely blunts these gastrointestinal side effects in comparative toxicology testing in non-human primates. This suggests that a Gleevec prodrug could substantially benefit patients undergoing treatment for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia. Given that Gleevec is now generic, there is little commercial motivation to introduce innovations into the treatment landscape for this devastating disease, which now afflicts more than 100,000 patients in the U.S. The prodrug could be approved in under two years on a 505(b)2 regulatory guideline, bringing urgently needed relief from adherence related side effects to these critically ill patients."
"9376357","Characterize differences in sleep spindles between Clinical High Risk and healthy controls longitudinally Project summary: Schizophrenia and related disorders are one of leading causes of disability worldwide, thus making the early identification of neurobiological vulnerabilities, which may serve as treatment targets, a critical research priority. In recent work, we found that individuals with chronic schizophrenia had a striking deficit in sleep spindles. A hallmark of Stage 2 Non-Rapid Eye Movement (N2) Sleep, spindles are short (0.5-2 s), waxing/waning oscillations within the 12-16 Hz range. Spindle abnormalities are also present in early course and early onset schizophrenia, and spindle-related measures, including amplitude, duration, and density, are associated with cognitive ability, social functioning, and tendency for magical thinking in healthy individuals, including adolescents and young adults. By investigating individual spindle parameters, we established that reduced spindle density and amplitude are associated with severity of symptoms and cognitive impairments respectively, in chronic schizophrenia patients. We also found that Integrated Spindle Activity (ISA), which combines individual spindle parameters in a single value, was the most discriminating measure, yielding ~90% separation between schizophrenia and control groups. Youth at Clinical High Risk (CHR) are a unique population enriched for precursors of major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, who also experience emergent cognitive impairments, social dysfunction, and sub-syndromal clinical symptoms. What we do not know is when spindle impairments occur, and how they may affect the development of psychopathology in this population. Thus, the first broad aim of this project is to characterize the role of sleep spindle parameters in moderating cognitive, social, and clinical functioning trajectories, including transition to psychosis, among youth at CHR. Sleep spindles are initiated by the interplay of the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN) with the dorsal thalamus. Thalamic activity is then relayed to the cortex, where spindle oscillations are synchronized. Specific features of spindles?density, amplitude and duration?reflect neural function in the thalamus, cortex, and thalamo-cortical connections, respectively. Moreover, GABA neurotransmission and thalamo-cortical connectivity play a critical role in generating and sustaining spindle oscillations. In recent work, we found that spindle deficits were most prominent in frontal and prefrontal scalp regions, and that reduced medio-dorsal (MD) thalamic volumes were associated with decreased sleep spindles in source localized prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia. Building on these findings, we will integrate data across multiple levels of analysis, from electrophysiology to neural to molecules, to characterize this spindle-related thalamo-cortical circuitry. Specifically, the second broad aim of this project is to identify the neuronal and molecular underpinnings of sleep spindle defects using sleep high density (hd)-EEG, 7T resting state (rs)-fMRI, and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI). In order to address these general aims, we propose to conduct longitudinal studies in 45 CHR and 45 healthy controls (HC), with three assessments of clinical and cognitive function, hd-EEG, fMRI, and MRSI over two years."
"9293142","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) occurs frequently in combat personnel and has been linked to complaints of emotional symptoms in up to 85% of those injured, with high rates of PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and mood swings. TBI may cause cerebral white matter injury and changes in white matter integrity have been correlated with behavioral changes even with very mild TBI. Patients with mild TBI also have higher rates of dishonorable discharge from the military, as well as substance abuse. Many of these behavioral changes are associated with alterations in frontal-subcortical networks, which are heavily dependent on white matter connectivity. Our primary goal in this proposed CDA-2 investigation is to begin to understand the specific neurological mechanisms that may underlie emotional dysfunction following mild TBI. White matter injury in mild TBI is not homogenous, but two white matter structures that may be of particular importance in the development of emotional disorders are the uncinate fasciculus and the anterior limb of the internal capsule (injured in between 30-40% of patients with mild TBI). Changes in these structures in other populations have been linked to fearful emotional processing and altered autonomic responses to stressors. Further, based on the literature demonstrating right-left hemispheric differences in emotional processing, there may be laterality effects of white matter injury. Thus damage to these pathways may increase a person's vulnerability to the development of abnormal emotional functioning, including symptoms associated with PTSD. A goal of this study is to compare patients with PTSD but no TBI to patients with TBI with and without emotional symptoms. It may be that the basic emotional responses of these populations are different and that these differences may help elucidate the mechanism accounting for these changes in mood and emotional behaviors. Finding a neurological and injury-specific basis for the constellation of chronic emotional symptoms observed in this population could have treatment implications such that the treatment of patients with versus those without injury induced PTSD may have different efficacies (e.g., exposure therapy may work best for the patients with non-injury related PTSD).  To test these hypotheses, we will recruit 40 subjects with mild TBI from our OEF/OIF poly-trauma clinic and 40 controls (20 with PTSD but no TBI). We will test emotional behaviors using an affective neuroscience methodology with indicators chosen based on the reported symptom profiles in this population. Specifically, we will assess the relationship between white matter injury in the uncinate fasciculus and anterior limb of the internal capsule and alteration of affective response physiologically (e.g., startle response while viewing high intensity positively and negatively valenced visual scenes) and cognitively (identification of the 6 primary emotions including ratings of intensity and arousal). To determine the integrity of white matter pathways, we will use high-resolution diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and related analysis techniques. In addition to helping better understand the basis of TBI induced emotional disorders, this project will provide the candidate with training in the technical aspects of neuroimaging methods including pre and post-processing techniques, region of interest identification, program choice and usage to accurately identify white matter, and data analyses. Further, these skills will be integrated with the candidate's psychophysiology and neuropsychology backgrounds. In addition, the candidate will gain experience with research on veterans with traumatic brain injury, while providing valuable data that will help us understand some of the disabilities and challenges faced by these patients."

"9458269","Novel therapy for Goodpasture syndrome Abstract  Goodpasture syndrome (GS) is a rare autoimmune pulmonary disorder evolving from glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease. GBM disease and GS are rapidly progressing, leading to renal failure and death if not treated. Current treatments are immunosuppressive and ineffective, and carry a high risk of adverse effects. Autoantibodies to the noncollagenous-1 (NC1) domain of the ?3 chain of type IV collagen (?3(IV)NC1), a component of the basement membrane of glomeruli and alveoli, trigger an immune response leading to antibody deposition on the basement, with subsequent inflammation and necrosis. Both antibody- mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) are involved. Blocking antibodies lacking effector functions have proven effective therapies in other autoimmune disorders of similar etiology (e.g., neuromyelitis optica). During this Phase I project, we will engineer a high affinity anti-type IV collagen human monoclonal antibody to eliminate all residual effector functions for linkage to a robust complement inhibitor. The resulting dual function fusion protein will inhibit GBM-binding by pathogenic antibodies as well as locally target complement activation. The outcome of this work will be a novel, mechanism-based therapy for Goodpasture syndrome."

By adopting a three-tiered data, tools, and knowledge paradigm we will lead, together with data generation partners, in the development and deployment of fundamental data models, common community standards, and scientific results to improve our understanding of the diverse cell types in the mammalian brain and its three dimensional organizational logic. This project proposes a unified solution to the development of its resource beginning with a data collection, quantification, and mapping framework for managing data and information across diverse repositories. The first step is to support the acquisition of fundamental data types from data partners by developing the data models and framework for importing structured data into the BRAIN Cell Data Center (BCDC) in consistent data description standards that describe and facilitate best practices for community use of multi-modal single cell data and its content. Toward achieving this end, we will partner with the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF), International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), Neuroscience without Borders (NWB), and other standards promoting organizations to leverage and extend existing standards to allow external data contributors to utilize the BCDC. For these data to be coherent, spatial common coordinate frameworks for mapping are essential, and the project develops and extends Allen Institute Mouse Common Coordinate Framework to enable external mapping of key single cell modalities in a 2D and 3D anatomic context for access and visualization at cell, nuclei, and/or population level. The entire resulting data, tools, and knowledge will be made publicly available in a unified and integrated web-accessible Cell Registry and Portal supporting data retrieval, search, visualization, and analysis of cell specific data and knowledge synthesis. The BCDC front end will provide data feature summaries, tools, and resulting knowledge, and links to raw data and high-resolution images, together with a programmable API/SDK that allows the community to build their own analysis applications and contribute tools. Finally, we will amplify public impact through strong BICCN partnership management, communication, standards committees, and analysis working groups, and develop infrastructure for maximizing community usage, publishing standards and tutorials, and coordinating education and outreach."
"9471713","ABSTRACT Physician-scientists serve as a critical bridge between the research laboratory and the clinic, uniquely positioned to conduct innovative biomedical research and translate relevant insights into meaningful improvements in human health. The success of the physician-scientist within the academic and biomedical research enterprise is clear, as dual-degree trained investigators are disproportionately represented among successful NIH grant awardees and recipients of honorary distinctions such as the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Despite these successes, recent trends described in the NIH Physician Scientist Workforce Study predict the future extinction of this highly-specialized cohort, citing obstacles such as the lack of demographic diversity, high rates of career attrition among junior investigators, and limited mentorship. In response, the NIH and other associations have initiated programs to prevent this population crash. One such organization is the American Physician Scientist Association (APSA), a student-driven, non-profit organization dedicated to career development and mentorship of physician-scientist trainees. In addition to its national reach, APSA maintains a strong regional presence through annual meetings in the Southeastern, Northeastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western regions of the United States. This year we are proud to host the 2017 APSA West Regional Meeting at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine on December 2nd, 2017. The purpose of the meeting is to provide a framework for bridging the scientific and mentorship gaps in physician-scientist training. Through interdisciplinary scientific talks by early and established clinician-scientists, workshops tailored to academic career development, and extensive outreach efforts to women and individuals underrepresented in science and medicine, the proposed conference will stimulate novel scientific collaborations, address critical voids in the physician-scientist training pipeline, and foster development of a diverse next-generation of scientists."
"9479864","PROJECT SUMMARY- PROJECT 3 Myalgic encephalomyelitis, or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is a prevalent and severe disease with symptoms including problems with concentration, memory and sleep, together with musculoskeletal pain. There is no established cause for ME/CFS; neither vaccines nor effective treatment options exist. Therefore, there is an urgent need to advance our understanding of the basic science of this disease as an integral step towards an ultimate cure. Despite our lack of understanding of ME/CFS, substantial evidence implicates immune dysregulation either as an underlying cause or major consequence of the disease. Nevertheless, the identity of specific dysregulated leukocytes (white blood cells, WBC) that are most implicated in ME/CFS is unclear. Project 3, part of our ME/CFS Collaborative Researcher Center application, proposes to elucidate immune dysregulation in ME/CFS by comprehensively investigating gene regulation defects in patients across all types of leukocytes. In Aim I, we propose to use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to interrogate the transcriptomes of leukocytes from peripheral blood collected from a cohort of ME/CFS patients and controls. This novel approach offers multiple advantages over all previous gene regulatory studies of the disease. First, scRNAseq is inherently unbiased with respect to the identity of the specific cell-types examined. Second, scRNAseq generates data with remarkable specificity and statistical power, allowing us, for example, to define the activation state of individual immune cells. Third, our scRNAseq approach will generate simultaneous measurements across the spectrum of cell types in blood. Thus, we will be able to discover coordinate changes in gene regulation between different cell types. In Aim II, we will extend our use of scRNAseq to compare leukocyte profiles from patients and controls post-exercise. This Aim is motivated by the need to better understand aberrant gene regulation in specific leukocytes resulting from exercise in ME/CFS patients, as post-exertional malaise is a defining symptom of the disease. Finally, in Aim III, we will examine possible roles for microRNAs found in extracellular vesicles (ECV-miRNAs) in ME/CFS. Extracellular vesicles are a newly discovered class of particles secreted by donor cells, which deliver cargoes, including miRNAs, to recipient cells, thereby altering the state of the recipient cell. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that ECV- miRNAs are altered in ME/CFS, examining samples obtained pre- and post- exercise challenge, and examine whether such alterations result in dysregulation of patient immune cells. Thus, the unifying theme of this study is to provide definitive data on gene regulatory changes in leukocytes from ME/CFS patients, and investigate whether ECV-miRNAs contribute to such changes. Because the patient and control cohorts examined are common across this U54 application, we will generate gene regulatory data from leukocytes before and after exercise (Project 3), together with neurological (Project 1) and physiological/molecular data (Project 2). Our comprehensive data will be a key resource not only for ME/CFS Centers, but for all researchers in the field."
"9340389","Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals."
"9566376","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema are, jointly, the third leading cause of death in the United States. The MESA Lung Study found that percent emphysema on computed tomography (CT) was the major correlate of impaired left ventricular (LV) filling in the general population and that the total (i.e., artery ad venous) pulmonary vascular volume (TPVV), a measure of the pulmonary macrovasculature on non-contrast CT had a wide distribution, was lower in COPD and emphysema, and was associated with reduced LV filling in a pattern often thought to reflect LV diastolic dysfunction. We also found that emphysema is common in the general population, often occurs without spirometrically defined COPD, and has a poor prognosis even in the absence of COPD. The major factors associated with progression of emphysema on CT among 4,472 participants followed for 10 years related to microvascular damage, endothelial adhesion molecules, endothelial-platelet interactions, and innate and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, medications interrupting some of these pathways were associated with slowed progression of emphysema. These longitudinal findings suggest that the pulmonary microvasculature may be critical to the development of emphysema. Pilot work suggests that this process may be mediated by purine (ATP and adenosine)-sensitive invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, cells in which the innate and adaptive immune systems intersect. For this renewal of the MESA Lung Study, we propose to perform contrast-enhanced, dual-energy CT to ascertain directly pulmonary microvascular blood volume (PMBV) in 1000 participants, assess emphysema subtypes, and spirometry among 2,000 participants, and measure iNKT cells in cases of emphysema, cases of reduced PMBV without obvious cause, and controls to test the following hypotheses: 1) PMBV is reduced and pulmonary artery volume is increased with percent emphysema and specifically in panlobular and centrilobular emphysema, suggesting that the site of resistance in these diseases is the pulmonary microvasculature; 2) immune activation is associated with emphysema progression and NKT-cell number and activation state are increased in emphysema and in participants with reduced PMBV; 3) lower regional and overall TPVV predicts progression of percent emphysema over 6 years among smokers and non-smokers. Innovative aspects of this proposal include the use of dual-energy CT scans to assess PMBV for the first time a large-scale study, longitudinal testing of the vascular hypothesis of emphysema among participants without COPD and among non-smokers, and assessment of iNKT cells in a multicenter study of emphysema. Confirmation of these aims in the MESA Lung Study, the only large, population-based, longitudinal study of emphysema, would provide a clear direction for strategies for the prevention of emphysema beyond smoking cessation and avoidance, a major new priority of the NHLBI/DLD, provide a potential imaging biomarker to facilitate early phase, short-term clinical trials, and suggest pulmonary vascular-related preventative and therapeutic strategies for emphysema."
"9503822","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyloid fibrils of 42- and 40-residues Alzheimer's ?-amyloid (A?) peptides represent two primary components of senile plaques, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As amyloid fibrils formed via self-assembly of A? show notable toxicity, neural cell deaths in AD have long been associated with A? amyloid fibrils. More recently, diffusible subfibrillar aggregates of A? were identified as a new suspect of AD since many of these diffusible A? aggregates show much higher toxicity than A? fibrils. Molecular structures of amyloid fibrils and diffusible aggregates of A? have attracted great attention. However, applications of traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography or solution NMR have been limited to non-crystalline amyloid aggregates. In particular, for more pathologically relevant 42-residue A? (A?42), only a few atomic-level structural details were known because of notoriously difficult sample preparation due to its high propensity to aggregate. Similarly, for A? mutants associated with early onset of AD, very little is known about structures of most pathogenic mutants such as E22G A? because they aggregate readily into heterogeneous aggregates, which are not suited for a structural analysis.  Through this study, we will reveal atomic details of amyloid fibrils and spherical aggregates in order to highlight structural relationships and interactions between different amyloid aggregate species, in particular for A?42, which is considered to be more pathogenic than more abundant 40-residue A?40. As a vital tool for site- specific structural analysis for amyloid aggregates, we will use solid-state NMR (SSNMR), in a combination with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), MD simulations, and other biochemical/biophysical methods.  Our studies entail the following three Specific Aims. (1) In Aim 1, we will establish preparation of homogenous amyloid fibrils optimized for structural analyses for A?42 and a pathogenic mutant E22G A?40. For the A?42 fibrils, we will elucidate atomic-level structural details by advanced SSNMR spectroscopy. The interactions of different A? species in AD will be modeled by cross-seeding experiments, which allow us to examine structural compatibility of two different A? species in fibrils. The aim will define structures and structural variations of A?42 fibrils while offering insight into how the structures can impact AD progression. (2) In Aim 2, we will examine atomic details of two distinctive diffusible A?42 aggregates. First, we will establish a synthetic reconstitute of highl toxic subfibrillar aggregate called amylospheroid (ASPD), which is found in AD brains. As the level of ASPD is correlated with the severity of AD, this study will reveal the first atomic detail a pathologically relevant amyloid oligomer in AD. We will also examine a similar spherical assembly called SPA, which has a larger size (20 nm diameter) and modest toxicity. (3) In Aim 3, we will profile structures and toxicity of brain-derived A?42 fibrils, which are replicated fro A?42 fibrils in AD brain. Through a comparison of ~30 brain samples, the aim will allow us to compare structures and toxicity of brain-derived amyloid fibrils in AD."
"9464034","PROJECT SUMMARY End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a complex disease that involves total and permanent kidney failure that affects more 600,000 individuals in the United States alone. Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining therapy for patients suffering from renal failure that requires that blood be withdrawn and cycled through a dialysis machine that performs the function of the failed kidneys. This process must be repeated at regular intervals and thus requires repeated needle punctures and the consequent needle access to a surgically created vascular shunt. These shunts are often created by connecting an artery to a vein with a prosthetic graft (arteriovenous graft [AVG]); these grafts, though widely used, suffer from many disadvantages. First, they do not allow for immediate cannulation and use in dialysis, as they require an initial period for tissue incorporation and healing post implant. Thus, more than 85% of ESRD patients start dialysis via tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) for long periods while their AVG heal. Because TDCs are associated with a high morbidity and mortality rates, the use of an AVG that can be cannulated immediately after implantation may reduce morbidity in these patients. Second, hemodialysis access injuries due to poor cannulation can result in aneurysms, clotted access, and infections. There is no AVG currently available that offers immediate cannulation after implantation, facilitates successful, error-proof needle entry, and protects from access cannulation injury. To reduce the incidence of needle cannulation injuries and associated complications such as graft thrombosis and aneurysms, InnAVasc Medical, Inc. has developed an immediate access hemodialysis graft that assures routine, successful cannulation and prevents graft injury; the Bullet Proof vascular graft. This graft is constructed of biocompatible materials and has been designed to be easily identifiable, immediately hemostatic, self-sealing and resistant to posterior and sidewall penetration. Preliminary data has shown extreme promise, demonstrating ease of safe, error proof, and immediate cannulation, and a dramatic reduction in time to hemostasis following needle removal. In this Phase II proposal, we will further the commercial development of the Bullet Proof graft by conducting biocompatibility and GLP animal studies with the final device as might be required for submission of an IDE to the FDA as well as conduct a first-in-man feasibility study. The specific goals of this study are 1) Perform biocompatibility testing to evaluate the chemical and material safety of the Bullet Proof graft, 2) Assess the consistency, reproducibility and reliability of the Bullet Proof graft using a GLP animal study, and 3) Conduct a first-in-man feasibility study in a limited and controlled human cohort to demonstrate that the product can perform for its intended purpose as a vascular access graft. Successful completion of these Phase II SBIR studies will allow us to submit for regulatory clearance for the finalized device, aggressively seek a viable and strategic partnership, and proceed with commercialization plans in the US and EU."

Project Summary The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) is a matrix cancer center that includes: the University of Kansas Medical Center campuses in Kansas City, Wichita and Salina, the University of Kansas in Lawrence and via consortium agreement, the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and Children's Mercy Kansas City. In 2015, 187 members of KUCC accounted for $13.4M of NCI funding and a total of $61.2M in overall cancer- related funding, an increase of $10M during the previous funding period. Roy A. Jensen, MD, who is supported by a strong, nationally recognized leadership team, leads KUCC. Over the last four years substantial progress has been made broadening partnerships with communities throughout the KUCC catchment area, boosting recruitment of physician-scientists, augmenting clinical research and early-phase clinical trials, advancing education for the next generation of scientists and health care providers and heightening influence for KUCC researchers in the national scientific community. KUCC has established four specific aims to ensure KUCC leads in the fight against cancer: 1. Leverage unique institutional and regional assets to become a leading academic institution for transforming  discoveries from the laboratory into new anticancer drug therapies; 2. Provide the optimal environment to focus the power of precision medicine, basic science inquiry, drug  discovery and development, and behavioral interventions to decrease cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality; 3. Be a nationally recognized leader in partnering with key stakeholders, community advocates and regional  leaders to develop, promote, and foster the adoption and implementation of research-based cancer  prevention, diagnosis, treatment, control, and survivorship practices throughout the KUCC catchment area  to mitigate the impact of cancer; and 4. Provide leadership in envisioning, developing and implementing a thoughtful, comprehensive strategy to  educate the next generation of physician-scientists and allied investigators in cancer research, treatment,  prevention and control.

"9567679","Transgenic and Gene-Targeting Shared Resource ? Project Summary Genetically altered mouse models are important tools for the researchers at the University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC). The production and analysis of such models ultimately leads to a better understanding of the nature, progression and functional genomics of tumor formation. They also serve as in vivo models for diagnostics and treatment. The Transgenic and Gene-Targeting shared resource (TGTSR), led Jay L. Vivian PhD, supports members of KUCC by providing centralized and comprehensive technical services for the production of novel transgenic and gene-targeted rodents and genetically altered pluripotent stem cells. The TGTSR uses cutting edge methods, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and novel reagents for the generation of these models. The TGTSR, housed at the KUMC campus, has four full time technical staff along with Vivian. The Cancer Center support of the TGTSR allows for the development of specific initiatives in the Facility relevant to cancer research. For example, certain transgenic methods and mutations are particularly relevant to cancer studies, including tissue specific transgene expression, subtle mutations that recapitulate clinically identified variants and somatic mutations and strain-specific nuclear transfer. Emerging technologies, including in vivo genome editing methods (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE nucleases) are providing a more rapid means of generating these types of novel mouse models of tumor progression. The integration of these continually evolving methods into the `toolbox' of the TGTSR greatly accelerates the development of animal models of cancer, while also reducing costs to KUCC researchers on all campuses."

The Department of Public Health Sciences at the Penn State College of Medicine proposes to serve as the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for SARP. The CCC will provide biostatistical leadership and scientific coordination for SARP; design and maintain the SARP operations management system; provide logistical and communications support for SARP; and distribute funds for a shared longitudinal protocol.  The Department of Public Health Sciences is uniquely qualified to serve as the Clinical Coordinating Center  for SARP, as the home of the Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) and the Childhood Asthma  Research and Education (CARE) Data Coordinating Centers since their inceptions in 1993 and 1999,  respectively, and the AsthmaNet DCC since 2009. The PI and core biostatistician of this application is David T. Mauger, PhD, who is currently the PI of the CARE and Asthma Net DCCs. Dr. Mauger will head a DPHS team well-experienced in data collection and management, biostatistical design and analysis, quality control, network infrastructure development and maintenance, and working with national repositories and oversight committees. This application also includes a very strong clinical co-investigator with extensive research experience in asthma, Joanna Floros, PhD. Although there will be many clinician investigators at the  network clinical centers who are leaders in the field, frequent, direct interaction between CCC personnel and  local co-investigators with clinical expertise greatly facilitates the activities of the CCC.  In summary, through its long history of managing successful data coordinating centers, Penn State College of Medicine's Department of Public Health Sciences is well poised to successfully implement and execute the Severe Asthma Research Program."
"9459191","ABSTRACT In type I diabetes, pancreatic islets are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction. Thus, a general strategic goal for preventing islet loss is to locally suppress this autoimmune response, while avoiding systemic immune suppression. FoxP3-expressing T regulatory cells (Tregs) are immune cells that play a central role in local tolerance, and therefore could serve as a potential platform for a cell therapy to prevent islet loss. Tregs have many attractive attributes as a suppressive cell therapy: they can exert dominant immunosuppressive actions, through cell-cell interactions or production of suppressive cytokines; they can in principle be long lived; and tolerance induced by Tregs can persist through infectious tolerance by conferring tolerogenic properties to neighboring cells. In mouse models, single infusion of Tregs can prevent and reverse diabetes indefinitely. The encouraging preliminary data in mouse models have let to the development of ongoing clinical trials of Treg cell therapies in humans. Nonetheless, Treg cell therapy presents several key challenges: it is hard to specifically target them to the islets and avoid systemic suppression, they are hard to expand in sufficient numbers (especially relative to conventional effector T cells), and their cell fate can be changed, especially in particular inflammatory microenvironments. In the past few years, however, there have been remarkable advances in using conventional T cells for cancer therapy (e.g. CAR T cells), including an explosion of new synthetic biology tools that can be used to precisely target T cells to disease tissues, to control their fate and proliferation, and to even give them the capability to locally deliver non-natural therapeutic payloads. Here our goal is to bring these new tools to bear on the problem of engineering improved islet-specific therapeutic suppressive cells. Our aims are to:  1) engineer natural Tregs with improved targeting and recognition of islets  2) develop tools to selectively expand therapeutic Tregs in vivo and enhance their stability  3) design synthetic suppressor cells that disarm effectors, dampen inflammation and promote islet repair These approaches wed cutting-edge synthetic biology with multiple strategies for developing therapeutic suppressor cells. We will establish proof-of-concept data using mouse model of autoimmune diabetes and apply them to test engineered human Tregs targeted to human islets using a humanized mouse model of autoimmune islet inflammation. Successful completion of this study will provide preclinical data for future implementation of these strategies in clinical trials."
"9369481","The intrinsic spatial resolution of modern whole-body PET scanners is about 4 mm. However, the practically achievable resolution of cardiac or abdominal PET imaging may be worse than 10 mm due to inevitable cardiac and respiratory motion. Motion artifacts from head motion are also one of the major hurdles in brain PET. Our work will allow dynamic as well as static imaging in the free- breathing patient while at the same time achieving the intrinsic resolution of PET. This ground- breaking (x2) improvement in spatial resolution will be accomplished while preserving, or sometimes increasing, the sensitivity of PET, which is quite unusual in medical imaging. The importance of the significantly improved accuracy, spatial resolution (i.e., from ~10 mm to ~4 mm) and sensitivity in PET enabled by this TR&D cannot be over emphasized because it will have significant impacts on many clinical applications, including: (1) revealing tumor heterogeneity (e.g., necrotic core), (2) imaging small lung tumors, (3) detecting non-transmural myocardial defects, and (4) staging and monitoring response to therapy in Alzheimer's disease using high-resolution PET imaging of tau. To achieve this goal, we propose novel MR-based PET motion correction and accurate/motion- dependent PET attenuation correction methods using PET/MR. Specifically, for conventional non- time-of-flight PET/MR, we propose to use a novel free-breathing ZTE/multi-echo sequence to obtain continuous attenuation coefficient maps of lungs, bones, fat and soft tissues. For the time-of-flight PET/MR, we propose a maximum a posteriori estimation of activity and attenuation correction factors (MAPAACF) method for robust attenuation coefficient estimation from TOF-PET data. We also propose novel and accurate MR-based motion estimation and tracking methods for imaging different organs with either rigid or non-rigid motion. Finally, we propose a novel low-rank tensor- based MR acceleration method that captures data correlation in multiple dimensions to significantly reduce MR imaging time."
"9563479","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Minnesota CHEAR Exposure Assessment Hub brings together highly talented investigators from the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health with broad and internationally recognized expertise in the identification and analysis of agents that are potentially harmful to human health, including children's health. Our team is unique because our scientists have years of experience in the development and application of state-of-the-art high throughput analytical chemistry methods based mainly on mass spectrometry for the assessment of trace amounts of targeted toxicant or carcinogen metabolites in large clinical and epidemiological studies, with all appropriate sample tracking and quality control methods in place. They have also developed and applied methods for the untargeted analysis of human serum, urine, or fecal samples as well as the analysis of DNA adducts and other biological response parameters in samples from humans. Therefore, we can provide children's health researchers with access to state-of-the-art infrastructure for both targeted and untargeted analysis of biological samples as well as characterization of biological responses associated with those exposures. This goal is firmly embedded within the concept of the exposome and its relationship to children's health. The resources and cores within this Hub are as follows: The Targeted Analysis Resource will use predominantly high throughput mass spectrometric methods with well-established quality control procedures to provide timely and reliable quantitative data relevant to 3 major areas of potential importance with respect to children's health: exposure to general environmental toxicants and carcinogens; exposure to tobacco-specific compounds; and variations in levels of endogenous and dietary compounds. The Untargeted Analysis Resource will conduct high resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics to examine the chemical composition of diverse biological samples relevant to children's health. The Biological Response Indicators Resource will conduct state-of-the-art analyses of carcinogen-DNA adducts, biomarkers of oxidative damage including DNA adducts, biomarkers of inflammation, and parameters of epigenetic modification. The Developmental Core will develop new high throughput methods to quantify organophosphate pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides in urine as well as their adducts to serum albumin, and will establish a multi- residue approach to bio-monitor relevant chemicals in hair. The Administrative Core will coordinate all activities within the Minnesota CHEAR Exposure Assessment Hub and serve as the link between our Hub and the CHEAR Coordinating Center."
"9408141","Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by fatty changes in the liver with inflammation and hepatocellular injury that in advanced stages leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and high mortality rates. NASH is frequently associated with other common metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance and visceral obesity. Liver transplantation is currently the only effective therapeutic approach for severe NASH or other forms of liver fibrosis with no approved drug treatments to date. Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is a signaling receptor that is highly abundant in liver stellate cells, hepatocytes and inflammatory cells which controls fibrotic, inflammatory and metabolic processes that lead towards severe NASH and liver cirrhosis. The cell-penetrating, lipidated PAR2 inhibitor OA-235i, was developed using our proprietary PepducinTM technology. PepducinTM technology offers a unique opportunity to target the intracellular surface of recalcitrant G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as PAR2 with exquisite specificity, potency and long half-lives, with prolonged drug exposure to the target tissue, namely liver. OA-235i is an advanced anti-fibrotic/anti- inflammatory drug candidate that blocks PAR2 signaling in hepatic stellate, inflammatory cells and hepatocytes. In the past 3 years, with Fast-Track support from the NIDDK, Oasis Pharmaceuticals successfully formulated and produced cGMP OA-235i at 97-98% purity and high stability. In in vivo efficacy studies, OA- 235i significantly reduced fatty liver steatosis/lobular inflammation/ballooning injury (NAS score) and ALT levels by 50% and gave complete suppression of AST in mouse models of diet-induced NASH to the same level of protection afforded by PAR2-deficiency. OA-235i afforded highly significant suppression of weight gain, liver weight, TGs, steatosis and development of liver tumor foci in a 6-month DEN-NASH model in mice fed a HFD. Delayed OA-235i treatment gave a significant 44-49% suppression of severe liver fibrosis induced by 8-weeks of CCl4 exposure. In 7-28 day repeat-dose safety/toxicology studies, OA-235i was safe and tolerated in dogs and in rat GLP studies with no evidence of liver, heart, kidney, lung, bone marrow, or other organ toxicity or any laboratory abnormalities at high multiples of the therapeutic dose. The translational studies in this Phase 2b application provide a rapid clinical validation and accelerate the commercialization of OA-235i for the treatment of NASH patients in collaboration with Duke Medical Center and Tufts Medical Center. Aim 1 will complete the IND Data Package for OA-235i in year 1 of funding with submission of the IND to the FDA as the first milestone. In years 2-3, Aim 2 will conduct a Phase I-single ascending dose (SAD) study in 17 normal healthy volunteers (NHV) and NASH patients followed by multi ascending 7-day repeat dose study (MAD) in 15 NHV/NASH subjects as the second major milestone. This First-in-Human study will establish the safe dose range, tolerability and PK/PD efficacy of OA-235i using ex vivo PAR2 assays and biomarkers and will inform the design and endpoints of Phase 2 studies to be conducted in the NASH population. 1"
"9464153","Personal behaviors during pregnancy influence gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia, in addition to developmental programming of the offspring. This application is designed to assess the technical merit, feasibility, usability and potential commercial application of a digital platform and wellness curriculum to reduce the health risks of the mother and child during pregnancy and after delivery. Currently, there are no evidence-based, scalable and holistic digital health programs for pregnant women during and post pregnancy, and the CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program is contraindicated for pregnant women. We propose to develop the initial eight sessions (6 during pregnancy, 2 post-pregnancy) of an 18-session digital wellness program implemented during pregnancy and 6-months post-partum when women are likely to be more receptive to engage in healthy behaviors. The program translates our prior research-tested, team-based intervention paradigm from a hardcopy curriculum with multiple in-person sessions to a digital format with interactive sessions administered by the participants via the digital platform, by videoconferencing. Participants will receive a digital scale, activity and sleep tracker and a sphygmomanometer that syncs wirelessly with the digital platform to each participant's personal Dashboard account. The wireless tracking and monitoring will occur across several metrics, tiers of social networking functionality, with time and behavior- based notifications to participants to ensure program adherence. The application will be accessible by mobile phone, smart devices and computer to facilitate participant interaction, motivation, peer support, and biometric and behavior monitoring. Between sessions, women participate in goals and engage in behavioral leaning activities related to the prior session's learning objectives. Messaging to women is based upon online platform utilization, reinforcing activities, long-term goals and social communication. Daily data derived from the digital scale, blood pressure, activity and sleep tracker, when outside recommended parameters, will immediately be seamlessly transferred to the woman's EMR and healthcare provider's secure and confidential fax or email. Curriculum sessions will focus on; a) weight gain and energy balance; b) nutrition during pregnancy; c)physical activity; d) stress reduction; e) sleep hygiene; and f) pregnancy physiology and fetal growth. Postpartum sessions include a) depression prevention; b) breast feeding; c) return to healthy pre-pregnancy weight via diet and physical activity; d) life balance and socialization. All team sessions are reinforced with activities between meetings, post-session goals, educational videogames and other digital resources including, exercise and cooking instruction videos, FAQs, meal and snack recipes and a pregnancy wellness guide. We will assess program feasibility, usability, resources, tools, tier support, relevance and satisfaction of the entire platform, tools and 8 sessions an accompanying weekly activities by six teams of 5 women/team with questionnaires, focus groups, and web analytics. In addition, we will specifically assess participant usage of various application components and monitoring devices. Healthcare providers will be queried about utility, satisfaction and recommendations regarding patient data uploads to the EMR, email or fax and perceptions of the intervention by survey.  "
"9565818","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Automation of Surface-Tethered Iterative Carbohydrate Synthesis (STICS) Project Summary Carbohydrates form the basis of all living organisms and, as a consequence, are ubiquitous both in nature as biologically active compounds and in medicine as therapeutics. Although there has been continued interest in the synthesis of carbohydrates, and the inherent complexity of these molecules consistently captures the attention of many scientists, methods for the isolation, chemical or enzymatic synthesis, analysis, and application of carbohydrates remain cumbersome. Ever-increasing time constraints and cost limitations on research and development in glycoscience and glycotechnology call for the development of rapid, efficient and operationally simple procedures. While this represents an immense task, as acknowledged in the recent National Academy of Sciences report Transforming glycoscience: a roadmap for the future, this proposal will focus on the introduction of a new, simple automation platform into the synthesis, evaluation, and application of carbohydrates on solid supports. Current automated methods for the synthesis of oligosaccharides are highly sophisticated, operationally complex, and require significant user know-how. On the other hand, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipment based automation introduced by our laboratories is by far a more attractive method. This is because almost all experimentalists have operational knowledge of and easy access to HPLC equipment. HPLC-assisted synthesis offers not only operational simplicity, but also convenient real-time reaction monitoring of every step using detectors and standard computer software and interface. We already achieved faster reaction times using less reactant, reagent and solvent than manual solid-phase synthesis. However, HPLC-based automation does have the inherent drawbacks of traditional solid-phase synthesis. Building upon promising preliminary results acquired during the development of HPLC-based and STICS approaches, this proposal aims to generate a user-friendly, universal platform for automated and monitored synthesis. This proposal is organized into four Specific Aims dedicated to: 1) new concepts for chemical glycosylation; 2) the refining of all aspects of HPLC-assisted synthesis; 3) the preparation and application of nanoporous materials as solid supports; and 4) the development of synthetic and analytical tools for studying tumor- associated markers. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we expect to have acquired a reliable and simple platform for automated oligosaccharide synthesis. Many classes of compounds can be obtained using solid supports; therefore, the proposed study is expected to be of valuable methodological and practical use to all scientists. Practically anyone with access to basic HPLC equipment should be able to perform automated synthesis and real-time reaction monitoring. Synthesis of carbohydrates and other classes of biomolecules using this user-friendly, automated platform will accelerate discovery in many scientific disciplines and, hence, significantly impact technology, society, the economy and human health."
"9418231","ABSTRACT Training the next generation of minority scientists is critical to eliminating health disparities. The Cancer Research Education Program (CREP) will play an important supportive role in the U-HAND (University of Houston/MD Anderson) partnership by developing the next cadre of leaders in cancer disparities. The CREP will leverage the existing strengths and resources of the University of Houston (UH) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA) and create new ones, training and motivating U-HAND scholars (undergraduate students, doctoral students, and postdoctoral fellows) and early stage investigators (ESIs). The CREP will coordinate all enrichment activities, including mentored research experiences, coursework, lectures, seminars, and interactive service learning experiences in the community. The interactive service learning activities will be provided through the robust and impactful Outreach Program in the Third Ward and East End neighborhoods of Houston, which are largely black and Hispanic neighborhoods, respectively. The Outreach Program will also provide needed cancer education and services and create opportunities to engage the community in cancer research, by serving as a participant recruitment and collaboration opportunity for U-HAND scholars, faculty, and the pilot projects. The specific aims of this program are to: 1) Identify, select, train, and mentor highly qualified undergraduate and doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and ESIs from historically underrepresented groups in science for research careers focused on lifestyle-related risk factors for cancer and cancer disparities; 2) Develop a competency-based comprehensive curriculum for cancer prevention and disparities research between U-HAND partners that includes didactic coursework, seminars, and interactive service learning experiences; 3) Develop and implement a community outreach program to provide service learning experiences for U-HAND scholars and engage community members in cancer prevention education, research, and clinical trials; and 4) Systematically evaluate all CREP participants and program activities, using these data to enhance and strengthen the program over time."
"9547567","Vaginal birth confers an 8-fold increase in the risk for a woman developing prolapse, a condition that results in 200,000 operations per year and carries up to a 25% reoperation rate at 10 years. Two primary causes for prolapse have emerged: 1) descent of the cervix and upper vagina (apical descent) involving the cardinal/uterosacral ligaments, and 2) neuromuscular damage to the levator ani muscles during vaginal birth.  The relationship between these factors is unknown. It is the overall goal of our research to discover the basic mechanism whereby muscle and ligament failure interact producing prolapse. Our theoretical work suggests the working hypothesis that levator damage leads to opening of the levator urogenital hiatus and results in exposure of the vaginal wall to a pressure differential that pulls downward on the apical supports.  Lack of data concerning ligament stiffness prevents a quantitative understanding of these relationships. We will recruit and test 50 asymptomatic volunteers and 50 women with pelvic organ prolapse to accomplish the following aims.  Aim 1 will use a new servoactuator device to measure the in vivo ligament force-displacement behavior (stiffness) to determine the role of different ligament properties in prolapse.  Aim 2 will make static and dynamic MRI images and clinical pelvic floor measurements to establish the relative contribution to apical descent by a) muscle impairment b) ligament properties.  Aim 3 will create subject-specific 3D models of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, which will be used to and determine the measurement differences in cardinal and uterosacral elongation in apical descent.  The results of this study will provide data that can lead to clinically relevant tests to, for example, identify which patients need an operation to support the apex. It will also provide the much needed data, validating an overall disease model concerning interactions between ligament support and muscle damage. This research will be helpful in developing strategies for improved prevention and treatment selection and a better understanding of why muscle damage at birth causes prolapse later in life."
"9406410","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center (CLDRC) is a long-standing interdisciplinary, multisite research program that investigates the genetic and environmental etiologies, neurobiology, neuropsychology, classification, and outcomes of learning disabilities (LDs) and related disorders such as attention/deficit- hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The overarching long-term goal of the CLDRC is to develop and refine a comprehensive neurodevelopmental and neurobiological model of LDs and related disorders, then to use that model to inform early screening and identification to guide prevention and treatment. Results from the CLDRC will facilitate refinements to theoretical models and improve classification of learning disabilities (LDs) and lead to important improvements in neural models of LDs and related disorders, including the cognitive correlates of LDs in the understudied population of bilingual learners. In combination with the results from the other projects, the molecular genetic analyses in Project IV will provide key information to develop and refine etiological models of the specific genetic and environmental risk factors that contribute to the development of LDs. Of similar importance to these research objectives are our related aims regarding the effective dissemination of our results. In addition to our ongoing efforts to publish our result for the scientific community, the Engagement Core will support efforts to translate and disseminate results from the CLDRC to a broader audiences of practitioners, educators, and individuals with learning disabilities. The CLDRC infrastructure also provides an unprecedented opportunity for interdisciplinary mentorship and project-embedded career enhancement opportunities for the next generation of LD investigators. We will continue to support these opportunities during the next five years through individual training plans, a new CLDRC webinar series, and the CLDRC Pilot Project Program, helping to ensure that the developing scholars in the CLDRC are highly competitive for positions in top-tier research universities when they leave our laboratories and training programs. The most distal long-term research objective of the CLDRC is the development of a comprehensive model of LDs that is based on a complete understanding of LDs at the genetic, environmental, neurobiological, cognitive, behavioral, and instructional levels of analysis. This is a daunting challenge that cannot be overcome by a single scientist or research lab working in isolation. Instead, this work will require the successful integration of diverse literatures, scientific approaches, and analytical strategies. The ongoing and long-term objective of the CLDRC is to continue provide a place where this integration can occur to promote interdisciplinary LD research and to develop the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and practitioners."
"9328661","Project Abstract Ubiquitination is an essential post-translational modification that regulates nearly all cellular processes, including cell division, differentiation, and protein quality control. As a result, aberrant ubiquitin signaling gives rise to diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Ubiquitination is carried out by a trio of enzymes (E1, E2, E3), including a diverse set of E3 ligases that catalyze the direct (RING) or indirect (HECT) transfer of ubiquitin to substrates. Recently, the Klevit laboratory classified the RING-Between-RING (RBR) family of E3s as a unique RING/HECT hybrid, in which a RING domain recruits the E2, but subsequent catalysis is performed through HECT-like cysteine intermediates. Dysfunction of RBR enzymes has been implicated in neurodegeneration, defects in organogenesis, and inflammation, yet the molecular mechanisms surrounding their unique catalysis and substrate targeting remains to be characterized. HHARI is a member of the auto- inhibited Ariadne family of RBR ligases, suggesting its temporal activation has important cellular consequences. While RBR enzymes share a common catalytic core, nothing is known about how they recognize their substrates. Recent structural studies of inhibited HHARI reveal significant separation between domains involved in E2 binding and catalysis. Given these results, we hypothesize that RBR enzymes contain unique surfaces involved in substrate recruitment and require large conformational changes to orient active sites for catalysis. To investigate this, I will carry out the following aims: Aim 1: How does HHARI recognize its substrate 4EHP. To understand how and where substrates bind, I will use high- and low- resolution structural techniques to define the interaction surface(s) on both HHARI and 4EHP. Whether these binding events contribute to global conformational changes will be explored using SAXS and HDX analysis. Additionally, these studies will take advantage of strategies used to trap ubiquitin intermediates, allowing for the study of distinct transition steps. The interactions identified through these studies will provide a foundation for understanding how RBRs select and engage their substrates. Aim 2: Functional characterization of the HHARI homolog, ARI-1, in C. elegans. Using the C. elegans homologs, ARI-1 (HHARI) and IFE-4 (4EHP), I will investigate the functional importance of RBR substrate recognition and catalysis in vivo. I will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to identify residues critical for distinct RBR functions, as well as substrate interactions with IFE-4. The functional consequences of these mutations will be evaluated by immunoprecipitation (IP), microscopy, and phenotypic characterization. Additionally, IP and mass-spectrometry will be used to identify an ARI-1 interaction network, which is likely to include novel substrates and provide insight into associated cellular pathways. Given our limited understanding of HHARI activation in vivo, these studies will provide insight into the temporal control and cellular consequences of HHARI activity, and will elucidate mechanisms controlling RBR substrate selection that could be exploited for therapeutic interventions."
"9513947","ABSTRACT The colon and anorectum have complex composition. Methods to study neuromuscular interactions and activity in health and gastrointestinal (GI) disease have been limited due to difficult access and lack of appropriate technologies. Many aspects of colonic mechanosensory physiology are still not well understood including the influence of enteric circuits and reflexes, and extrinsic nerve function in the various segments of the colon. The need for new technology and a better understanding of the neuromuscular function is substantial. A significant problem is a lack of physiologically-relevant and practical test for identifying the underlying mechanism(s). Hence, the overall objective is to validate a fully integrative dynamic tool that mimics feces transport in the lower GI tract. Accordingly, the following tasks are proposed: 1) Optimization of a wireless development of Fecobionics device and System for neuromuscular function studies of the colon. Milestone: Wireless device that can record during transport through colon and anorectum; 2) Conduct safety and performance studies in dogs (including IDE approval): Milestone: Studies that demonstrates safety and performance of the device under different neuromuscular conditions; and 3) Develop a validated mathematical model of the lower GI tract. Milestone: Geometric and functional mathematical model for colonic transport and defecation. The proposed technology (Fecobionics) is a simulated electronic feces that has the consistency and shape of normal stool. The measured variables in Fecobionics include multiple pressures, shape changes, velocity and orientation. Hence, it will be feasible to map and describe objectively (without disturbing the colonic transport and defecation processes) the transport characteristics and neuromuscular signatures during colonic transport and initial entry from the rectum into the relaxing anal canal. This unique device will provide new neuromuscular signatures of the lower GI tract under normal circumstances, and during intervention with enteric and peripheral nerve activity to enhance our understanding of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the lower GI tract neuromuscular function. In line with SPARC mission, we intend to provide a new technology for lower GI testing, simulating normal stool transport and defecation with a bionics device. This technology will replace several current tests, because it provides an integrated frame work for assessing function and obviates the need for multiple tests of function. The central premise is that a novel and unique Fecobionics device that mimics natural lower GI transport will provide new mechanistic insights regarding colonic and anorectal physiology when compared to standard tests and facilitate development of new diagnostics for lower GI disorders. The significance is to address the major gaps in knowledge by developing a safe, low cost, less invasive, low risk, radiation-free device, and test its ability to provide new understanding of colonic neuromuscular and defecation function. This may later facilitate development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools that will reduce healthcare costs."

"9351524","The viral envelope glycoprotein gpl20 is responsible for the initial events in HIV-1 infection. In its unliganded state, gpl20 is characterized by the presence of intrinsically disordered domains. In particular, the residues that define the co-receptor binding epitope are disordered and only become binding competent when CD4 binds gp 120. The rational design and optimization of inhibitors require a precise knowledge ofthe contribution of each residue at the gp120/CD4 interface to the binding affinity and to the allosteric structuring process. These issues are addressed in terms of the following specific aims: 1. Thermodynamic characterization of the structural stability and cooperative linkage between binding sites in trimeric (solution and membrane bound) and monomeric gp 120 by utilizing a combination of microcalorimetric and structure-based thermodynamic studies. How do intersubunit interactions within the trimer modulate the functional behavior of gp 120? 2. Thermodynamic characterization of conformational changes associated with receptor, co-receptor and inhibitor binding in trimeric (solution and membrane bound) gp 120. These studies will utilize differential scanning calorimetry, isothermal titration calorimetry and spectroscopic probes. 3. CD4 binding allosterically activates gp 120 by triggering a major conformational change. What are the binding hotspots within the CD4/gp120 binding footprint? Do they overlap with the residues that initiate the allosteric cascade? Themodynamic-based alanine scanning mutagenesis will be used to identify binding and allosteric hotspots. Can we inhibit gp120 binding without triggering the allosteric activation cascade? Are the binding and allosteric hotspots the same in the monomer and trimer? Does the membrane affect the interactions? This fundamental information will drive the computational and synthetic components of the POI. 4. Development of thermodynamic guidelines for the design of highly potent, energy efficient gp 120 inhibitors. The thermodynamic signature of all inhibitor candidates will be determined calorimetrically as it captures the essential properties of inhibitors and can be used for further inhibitor optimization. 5. Development of thermodynamic guidelines for gp120 inhibitors that are effective against different HIV-1 subtypes and exhibit low susceptibility to potential drug resistant mutants."
"9417650","ABSTRACT Chicago?s South Side is one of the nation?s most medically underserved urban areas, facing significant disparities in the incidence and mortality of cancer. Eliminating or reducing cancer disparities in this community requires the commitment of a health care and biomedical research workforce that reflects the make-up of the local community and understands its underlying challenges. The University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC), considered a national leader among cancer centers in supporting the training and career development of next-generation cancer researchers, will serve as the epicenter of the proposed training program, Chicago EYES (Educators and Youth Enjoy Science) on Cancer. The overall objective of the program is to train high school students, undergraduates, and high school teachers through research experiences and outreach, thereby enhancing the diversity of the workforce necessary to meet the nation?s biomedical, population-based and clinical cancer research needs. To accomplish this goal, we will: 1) Provide mentored research experiences and career/skills development to individuals from underrepresented backgrounds at the high school and undergraduate level to inspire and prepare them for research careers in cancer and/or cancer disparities; 2) Provide high school teachers of underrepresented students with research experiences and curriculum development to prepare them to disseminate knowledge and generate excitement for science; and 3) Create a strong and long-lasting network of support for students throughout their career journeys. In addition to assembling a dedicated mentor team for each individual, providing hands-on research training and curriculum development for their teachers, and engaging families and communities for support, we will also develop a detailed tracking system to facilitate ongoing communication with program alumni and personalized assistance as needed. The experienced leadership team has the scientific, educational, and administrative expertise, coupled with an established track record of developing and evaluating cancer research pipeline programs, necessary to successfully deliver the proposed program. Importantly, the program will facilitate strong partnerships with key institutions on Chicago?s South Side, namely the Museum of Science and Industry and diverse local high schools and institutions of higher learning. Together, the leadership team, outstanding mentors, and committed partners are well positioned to successfully develop the program, evaluate success and support the proposed activities to create and sustain a diverse cancer research workforce. Through Chicago EYES on Cancer, the UCCCC is committed to positively impacting the scientific career development of South Side Chicago youth as well as the education and engagement of the local community."
"9370633","Abstract  Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is the bane of elective total joint replacement (TJR) surgery, of which the vast majority is caused by Staphylococcal species. Although the number of primary infections following TJR is low (1-5%), reinfection rates are very high (15-40%), which has led to the orthopaedic paradigm that S. aureus infection of bone is incurable. Additionally, PJI is known to be a non-random event that is largely determine by patient-specific factors, as infections are caused by only a few prevalent nosocomial strains (i.e. MRSA USA300), and implementation of the most rigorous surgical systems is incapable of reducing infection rates below 1%. Moreover, ~13% of patients infected with S. aureus become septic and die from multiorgan failure, while others recover with little intervention. To address these very significant issues, we propose the Center of Research Translation on the Osteoimmunology of Bone Infection (CoRTOBI), which is the evolution of two highly successful programs (AOTrauma Clinical Priority Program on Bone Infection (AO-CPP); and NIAMS P50 CORT AR54041 ?Translating Molecular Signal Pathways to Orthopaedic Trauma Care?) that will be completed this year. To capitalize on the salient strengths of these programs, the CoRTOBI now proposes to advance and translate the major discoveries from the AO-CPP on S. aureus infection of bone and host immunity, using the proven administrative structure of the P50 CORT. These discoveries include: 1) S. aureus colonization of the osteocytic-canalicular network of live bone, 2) novel antibiotics that specifically target these mechanisms, which can be 3D-printed into custom spacers, 3) development of a custom multiplex Luminex assay to elucidate the immune proteome of S. aureus, and 4) identification of the anti-Isd vs. anti-Atl immune proteome ratio as a susceptible vs. protective index of host immunity against S. aureus. The proposed CoRTOBI will consist of an Administrative Core that will provide operational and fiscal management of the CoRTOBI, as well as a Clinical Research Sub-Core, a Biostatistics Sub-Core, an Enrichment Programs, and a Pilot and Feasibility Project Program. There are two Research Projects. Project 1 is focused on elucidating the mechanisms of S. aureus motility in bone and developing novel antibiotic impregnated 3D-printed spacers. Project 2 is focused on defining the susceptible vs. protective immune proteomes of Staphylococcus osteomyelitis and interventions for septic death. The Projects will be supported by an Osteoimmunology Research Core, which will provide state of the art imaging, biomaterial fabrication and immunoassay analyses. At the conclusion of this CoRTOBI we will have new knowledge on the microbial pathogenesis of bone infection and the host response. We will also develop novel diagnostics and interventions for patients with osteomyelitis."
"9383202","Abstract Our long-term goal is to first assess and ultimately manage pain after lung cancer surgery using computer technologies to minimize pain assessment barriers and thereby support clinical pain management processes. The first step in assuring high quality pain management is appropriate pain assessment. However, the barriers to pain assessment are among the causes for unrelieved pain. The lack of time-efficient comprehensive pain assessment tools and patients' difficulties in completing the tools are among the most known barriers to assessing pain in Turkey. Recent studies show that Americans are able to use computers to report their pain. A computerized format for pain assessment called PAINReportIt, published in 2003, is the first interactive software extension of the 1970 McGill Pain Questionnaire. This innovative method can provide pain measurement items to responders in serial display screens accompanied by pop-up screens. It has been tested in English-, Spanish-, and Mandarin Chinese-speaking adults, but it has not been tested among Turkish- speaking adults. Furthermore, there are not any tablet-based pain assessment tools being used in hospitals or clinics in Turkey. Therefore, to establish our potential for collaboration, we used a committee approach with 3 bilingual translators to independently translate PAINReportIt from English to Turkish, reconcile differences, and agree on an integrated version. We now propose a three-component study to validate and facilitate implementation of the Turkish- PAINReportIt in Turkey: (1) a qualitative study to assess patients' interpretation of the Turkish-PAINReportIt items and instructions among 20 Turkish lung cancer outpatients who will participate in cognitive (think-aloud) interviews to validate the Turkish-PAINReportIt, (2) an 8-member focus group with lung cancer surgeons and surgical nurses to discuss the issues and benefits they would anticipate if the Turkish-PAINReportIt were implemented in research studies and cancer care, and (3) a longitudinal study to profile post-thoracotomy pain recovery among 80 Turkish lung cancer patients who will be asked to complete the tool on an Internet-enabled tablet daily on postoperative days 1 to 4 and at their 2-week postoperative follow-up visit. Patients will complete a usability and acceptability questionnaire to share their opinions about using Turkish-PAINReportIt to report their pain. The specific aims are to (1) describe the meanings attributed to the Turkish-PAINReportIt items and instructions by Turkish patients who are post- thoracotomy for lung cancer treatment, (2) identify the technical and human (patient, nurse, and physician) factors that could be barriers or facilitators to use the Turkish-PAINReportIt, (3) characterize the pain (location, intensity, quality, pattern) they experience longitudinally after surgery when pain is expected to decrease as their recovery progresses. We expect to discover barriers that can be addressed and facilitators for successful adoption in cancer research and practice in Turkey. Successful use of the tablet-based pain tool could lead to improved pain control for the Turkish people diagnosed annually with lung and other cancers."
"9311336","Project Summary  The proton-pumping vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase; V1Vo-ATPase) is an essential enzyme complex found in the endomembrane system of all eukaryotic organisms and in the plasma membrane of some animal cells. The V-ATPase functions in ATP hydrolysis-driven acidification of subcellular compartments or the extracellular space, a process vital for basic cellular processes including endocytosis, protein trafficking, bone remodeling, urine acidification, sperm maturation, and neurotransmitter release. Loss of V-ATPase in animal cells is embryonic lethal, while partial loss of function (or hyperactivity) has been linked to numerous human diseases, such as renal tubular acidosis, osteoporosis, diabetes, male infertility, neurodegeneration, cancer, and AIDS. Fighting these diseases on a molecular level will require a detailed understanding of the structure, catalytic mechanism, and regulation of the eukaryotic V-ATPase complex.  In cells, V-ATPase activity is regulated by a unique mechanism referred to as reversible disassembly, a condition under which the complex dissociates into V1-ATPase and Vo proton channel sectors that are both functionally silenced. Despite its important role in V-ATPase function, the molecular mechanism of activity regulation by reversible disassembly is poorly understood, a gap in knowledge that is largely due to the lack of high-resolution structural information and a defined in vitro model system to study the process under controlled conditions.  The immediate goal of this project is to obtain high-resolution structural and mechanistic information aimed at a better understanding of V-ATPase regulation and to uncover non-canonical functions of the V- ATPase Vo membrane sector that may play a role in neuronal communication. We will address these questions with the following specific aims: (1) Molecular determinants of V-ATPase assembly and disassembly (2) Non-canonical functions of the V-ATPase Vo membrane sector.  We study the structure and regulation of the yeast V-ATPase, a powerful model system for the mammalian enzyme due to the high level of conservation of the enzyme's structure and mechanism across species, the ease of genetic manipulation, and the ability to obtain highly purified enzyme with a defined subunit composition. The long-term objective of the project is to develop strategies aimed at either promoting or inhibiting the process of reversible disassembly of the human V-ATPase that will allow modulation of the activity of the enzyme in a tissue and subunit isoform dependent manner for therapeutic purposes."
"9444085","PROJECT SUMMARY No effective therapeutic agents currently exist to improve outcomes in autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders. Genetic research has led to the discovery of a growing list of highly penetrant mutations that contribute to disease pathophysiology. This recent progress provides an important opportunity to define the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders, as well as to identify targets for new treatment strategies. However, given the large number of emergent loci, a major challenge for the current phase of autism research is to establish convergent cellular mechanisms that group apparently distinct genetic etiologies. Here we focus on the following disease-associated proteins: the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A/E6-AP and Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs), with an emphasis on NHE6 (also known as SLC9A6). Genetic mutations affecting these proteins are associated with overlapping clinical syndromes. These shared clinical spectra suggest that UBE3A and NHEs may function in a convergent cellular pathway. Exciting preliminary data support a functional interaction between UBE3A and NHE6 in the regulation of intra-organellar pH. Discovery of a shared pathway for UBE3A and NHEs involving intra-organellar pH would be fortuitous because FDA-approved drugs known to target this cellular process are currently available. Therefore, success in this research would lay the foundation for future drug screening in available models of disease, including both patient-derived iPSCs and animal models. Our central hypothesis is that UBE3A controls trafficking and degradation of NHEs, and that perturbations in UBE3A activity (through loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations) cause abnormalities in the regulation of intra-organellar pH as a result of mislocalization and aberrant accumulation of NHEs. Such abnormalities in intra-organellar pH will disturb organellar functions, including protein processing, trafficking, and signaling, and ultimately disrupt circuit development. We will test this hypothesis and build a path for future research through these Specific Aims: (1) Determine the extent to which UBE3A governs the trafficking and degradation of NHE proteins; and (2) Investigate perturbations in regulation of intra-organellar pH mediated by UBE3A and NHE6. We are conducting innovative, live-cell imaging of intra-organellar pH in neurons, from both patient-derived iPSCs and also animal models, by targeting ratiometric pHluorin to specific organellar compartments. The research is significant because: (1) The discovery of a functional linkage between autism-associated genes serves the important goal of developing more unified pathogenic mechanisms yielding treatment targets; and (2) UBE3A has been a widely studied protein; however, a role in modulation of intra-organellar pH represents a new mechanism with a potential for targeting by therapeutic drugs."
"9448713","PROJECT SUMMARY The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is almost 30% in the western world and is expected to rise in the next decade. NAFLD is characterized by protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Prolonged ER stress conditions further lead to oxidative stress, protein aggregation, organelle damage, cellular bioenergetic collapse, and eventually cell death. Recent studies indicate that protein misfolding in the ER contributes to hepatocyte failure associated with NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Through detailed characterization of hepatocyte function, our preliminary results lead us to propose that ER protein misfolding causes mitochondrial dysfunction that leads to further protein misfolding culminating in hepatocyte failure. Although previous studies demonstrated that protein misfolding in the ER of hepatocytes is associated with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD, there has never been a careful characterization of how ER protein misfolding causes catastrophic cellular events leading to oxidative damage, fibrosis and cell death. We have shown that misfolding of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the ER disrupts complex 1 of the electron transport chain. Amazingly, we demonstrated that treatment with a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant corrects he defective mitochondrial function and also improves FVIII folding in the ER in cell culture. This unprecedented finding indicates an unappreciated association between ER protein misfolding and defective mitochondrial bioenergetics. In the proposed studies, we will use two separate models to induce ER stress in vivo in hepatocytes; (i) excess nutrition of a high fructose diet, or (ii) expression of FVIII to elucidate how ER protein misfolding disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics. Presently, ongoing clinical studies are using viral delivery of FVIII to hepatocytes in hemophilia A patients. Furthermore, we will apply non-biased technologies of metabolomics and RNA-Seq using novel genetic murine models to elucidate how protein misfolding causes Ca2+ leak from the ER and entry into the mitochondrial matrix to disrupt mitochondrial bioenergetics and/or dynamics. Evidence supports that ER protein misfolding and defective mitochondrial function exist in all degenerative diseases. In addition, extensive findings demonstrate that protein misfolding in the ER is associated with liver failure in a number of common acute conditions including viral infection, ethanol toxicity, acetaminophen toxicity and ischemia reperfusion injury. Our fundamental novel exploration into unchartered territory will undoubtedly generate new hypotheses concerning the impact of ER protein misfolding on the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The studies will provide fundamental mechanistic insight into how ER and mitochondrial functions are reciprocally regulated and lead to novel therapies for NAFLD and other diseases of protein misfolding."
"9567053","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric dysphagia-chronic difficulty with feeding and swallowing-is a serious complication in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Dysphagia can be recognized in between 35% and 80% of newborns, infants and older children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and the incidence is currently increasing. The consequences of pediatric dysphagia include failure to gain weight, malnutrition, acute choking, food aspiration and naso-sinus, middle ear, and lung aspiration related infections including pneumonia. Current therapies aim at relieving symptoms or modifying food to ease difficulties; however, there are neither cures nor preventive strategies for pediatric dysphagia. The lack of new approaches reflects a lack of fundamental understanding of neural and oro-pharyngeal mechanisms that are disrupted in pediatric dysphagia, and their developmental causes. Our research program will provide this fundamental understanding by defining the pathology, developmental origins, and approaches for prevention of pediatric dysphagia. Our goal is to provide a new foundation for better diagnosis and therapy for dysphagia in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders and new clinically tractable approaches for preventing or diminishing dysphagia. Achieving this goal is now possible because our group has established the first genetically defined, behaviorally and pathologically validated model of pediatric dysphagia. We have found that the LgDel mouse model of 22q11 Deletion Syndrome, a genetic deletion neurodevelopmental disorder in which at least 45% of affected children have pediatric dysphagia, accurately recapitulates key dysphagic features: LgDel mouse pups fail to gain weight, aspirate milk acutely, and have a high incidence of naso-sinus, middle ear, and lung inflammation and infection. We will now use this powerful research tool to determine contributions of disrupted brainstem neural circuits versus oro-pharyngeal mechanics to pediatric dysphagia (PROJECT 1), how the pathology of pediatric dysphagia arises during development of the embryonic hindbrain (PROJECT 2), and how neural circuit or oro-pharyngeal pathology can be prevented by restoring disrupted development to normal status via maternal nutrition (PROJECT 3). These three projects will be supported by a core for administration (CORE A), animal models and dysphagia pathology (CORE B), genomics and bioinformatics (CORE C), and microscopic imaging and analysis (CORE D). Our research team has established expertise in cellular neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, developmental biology, genetics and genomics. We will work closely with our clinical partners at Children's National Health System to maximize translation of our results to viable new therapies for children with dysphagia. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to undertake the first truly integrated biological mechanistic analysis of pediatric dysphagia. Our results will be transformative: they will define new diagnostic criteria, therapies, and prevention strategies to improve the vital capacity of feeding and swallowing in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9349910","SUMMARY Much attention has been invested in cataloging the microbes that inhabit our bodies in various states of health and disease. Equally pressing is an understanding of the molecular pathways by which these communities of microbes (our `microbiome') program our physiology. This process occurs from the moment that the microbiome first colonizes the gut in early infancy. During this `critical period,' microbial input is required to complete development of the intestine, immune and nervous systems. When appropriate, these interactions provide a foundation for future health, but when it is disrupted, it predisposes individuals to disease. Thus, defining the genetic regulators of these events is one of the most fundamental questions in microbiome research today. Our goal is therefore to comprehensively identify the molecular pathways that govern microbiome programming of host physiology. Here, we propose a suite of innovative methods that will, for the first time, allow us to resolve microbial programming response networks in whole organisms?a veritable microbiome `moon shot'. This is made possible by employing a simple, exquisitely defined, and high-throughput amenable animal system, Caenorhabditis elegans. We have identified the C. elegans natural microbiome and characterized its wide breadth of influence on host physiology and development. We believe that the C. elegans system is ideal for interrogating the impact of microbiome programming for four main reasons. First, microbial exposures during larval development dictate adult physiology. Second, the intestinal niches that are available for bacteria are comparable to the infant gut structural, chemical, immune and digestive environment. Third, the potential host response pathways are well-conserved. Fourth, a majority of the types of microbes that are found in the infant gut also naturally colonize C. elegans. We propose to leverage this system to elucidate the networks of microbiome reprogramming by employing two complementary projects. In Project 1, we will generate the first complete map of the impact of microbiome programming on whole organism host physiology. These studies will use a new sequencing method that we are developing to quantify the impact of microbiome programming on all of C. elegans 959 cells in hundreds of animals at a time. In Project 2, we will identify the host genetic landscape that governs microbial programming using strategies that greatly enhance the throughput and phenotyping of targeted genetic disruptions. Based on preliminary data, we will first characterize the role of the highly redundant, receptor-mediated signaling pathways in this process. Results from these studies will identify host pathways that promote healthy microbial programming early in life, and will aid in the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at reopening this critical period to mitigate adult disease."
"9268455","DESCRIPTION :         Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the signature injury of the current military conflicts: Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). In Veterans of these conflicts, mTBI commonly co-occurs with mental health disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Hazardous alcohol use or probable alcohol use disorder (AUD) is also extremely prevalent in Veterans. The presence of an AUD has further negative impact on rehabilitation effectiveness for our Veterans with TBI. Craving, or the urge to consume a substance, is a critical characteristic of AUD. Alcohol craving negatively impacts rehabilitation and is associated with relapse in the alcohol-withdrawn addict. No studies to date have examined the role of alcohol craving in Veterans with co-occurring mTBI, PTSD and AUD (mTBI+PTSD+AUD). Therefore, the objectives of the current CDA II application are to characterize alcohol craving, develop a better understanding of the mechanism underlying alcohol craving, and develop a novel treatment intervention for alcohol craving reduction. In order to do so, OEF/OIF/OND Veterans will be recruited and classified into one of two groups based on self-report and neuropsychological assessments: 1) asymptomatic combat control Veterans with probable AUD (AUD alone) and 2) Veterans with mTBI+PTSD+AUD. First, alcohol craving and excessive alcohol use in these two groups will be compared. This will be done by conducting objective measures of alcohol use (e.g., urine and breath alcohol concentration tests), self-reports of alcohol use, and alcohol craving. Second, the neurophysiological mechanisms of alcohol craving will be examined in order to develop a novel treatment intervention for craving reduction. To do so, Veterans will participate in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol where brain activation will be measured in response to viewing images relating to alcohol compared to neutral images. Advanced neuroimaging procedures to determine the structural integrity of white matter fibers in the brain and to determine spontaneous activity in neuronal networks, a process called functional connectivity analysis, will also take place. The neuroimaging data will be evaluated collectively to elucidate the mechanism underlying alcohol craving and, along with the literature, these data will be used to develop a protocol for the neurotherapeutic intervention repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Third, the safety, feasibility, and the immediate effect of a single rTMS session on alcohol cravings along with neural activity and connectivity in Veterans with mTBI+PTSD+AUD will be examined. Veterans will complete neuroimaging, alcohol craving, and alcohol use measures as described above pre- and post-rTMS. Self-report alcohol craving will also be assessed at one day, one week, and one month post-rTMS via phone interview. It is expected that this innovative project will contribute a missing, fundamental element to our base knowledge, without which alcohol craving in Veterans with mTBI+PTSD+AUD cannot be understood. The acquisition of such knowledge is critical to the development of improved therapeutic strategies for alcohol addiction in Veterans with co-occurring mTBI and PTSD."

Godwin, PhD (Director, BSR; Deputy Director, KUCC, and D3ET member) and by Rashna Madan, MBBS, FCAP, FASCP (Assistant Director, BSR) plays a vital role in the University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) by its ethical collection, storage, annotation, and distribution of high quality biospecimens, such as fresh/fresh-frozen tumor tissues of varying histology and bodily fluids (blood, saliva, urine, ascites fluids) which are essential to support translational research and investigator-initiated studies. The BSR also provides expert histopathology support and combines the expertise of pathologists, translational researchers, and technical personnel to produce a comprehensive and focused approach to support the research activities at KUCC. The BSR is overseen by an internal advisory board (IAB) and the director and assistant director, Godwin and Madan, respectively. Colleen Reilly (Project Manager) provides the day-to-day staff supervision and Cassaundra Shipman (Program Development Manager) oversight of participant consenting. The BSR is staffed by four research coordinators who identify participants and administer informed consent, one clinical laboratory supervisor, two lab technicians who handle the processing and banking of biospecimens, one histotechnologist who performs advanced histology services, including histology support for therapeutic clinical trials, and one cancer registrar who performs searches for samples to match user requests and enters clinical information not available electronically into our developing Curated Cancer Clinical Outcomes Database (C3OD). Additionally tissue biospecimen collection is facilitated by pathology assistants, residents and fellows at the KU Hospital and the Indian Creek Campus as part of the KU Health System's commitment to the Cancer Center's BSR. The BSR is fully equipped for biospecimen collection, processing, and distribution, and thus, the BSR adheres to the OSHA laboratory standards for handling cryogens, ISBER Best Practice for Repositories, and NCI Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources, and has developed Standard Operating Procedures to govern each of these processes. The collection, processing, and distribution of samples by the BSR staff has grown substantially over the past four years (2012-2015) and now includes collections of pediatric sarcomas from ICC and underserved populations from the satellite biospecimen bank at Truman Medical Center, a member of the Midwest Cancer Alliance and the Kansas City safety-net health system. Together, this essential KUCC shared resource, houses over 9,000 tissues and more than 20,000 blood samples (including either single or repeat draws from individuals diagnosed with cancer, benign disease, or no evidence of cancer) from >17,000 participants (enrolled by the end of 2015) and distributed nearly 16,000 specimen aliquots since 2012. In CY15 (the reporting year), the BSR services were used by 74 investigators, 44 who were KUCC members, an increase of nearly 2-fold during the funding period."
"9569857","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite improved survival, childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at high risk of late and long term effects from their disease and rigorous treatment. Hispanic CCS, who are underrepresented in survivorship research, show significant health inequities in mortality compared to non-Hispanics. Although life-long, risk based follow-up care is recommended for CCS, use of this care drops rapidly as CCS enter emerging adulthood. Our preliminary work among CCS treated at two hospitals (ages 14-26 when surveyed) indicates that cancer related follow-up care is significantly lower among Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic) CCS during the early years of emerging adulthood (ages 21-26). We propose to recruit and survey a population-based cohort (n=1,232) of emerging adult (ages 18-39) Hispanic (54%) and non-Hispanic CCS to understand potential inequities in the receipt of recommended follow-up care, as well as factors that may differentially affect health outcomes of Hispanic and non-Hispanic CCS. Our aims are to determine: 1) risk and protective factors of receiving cancer related follow-up care; 2) if the follow-up care received (based on medical records review) is consistent/adherent with published Long- Term Follow-up Guidelines (for patient specific cancer and clinical history); and, 3) the relationship between milestones of emerging adulthood (e.g., full-time employment, marriage, having children) and receipt of cancer related follow-up care. Adherence to guideline care will be assessed by a physician panel. Comparative analyses will be used to identify differences by ethnicity and treatment site (cancer survivorship clinics and at primary care/community clinics). Results from this population-based study will provide guidance to identify and reduce health inequities observed between Hispanic and non-Hispanic CCS in health care utilization, late effects, and ultimately, long term survival. Results can guide education/policy efforts focused on clinicians who treat Hispanic CCS as well as support specialized transition clinics and health promotion efforts focused on CCS entering emerging adulthood."

"9450005","PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite the substantial work in cardiovascular pharmacogenomics published over the past decade, a fundamental gap remains in understanding whether the genomic diversity of Caribbean Hispanics accounts for high inter-individual variability of clinical outcomes to preventive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel. Caribbean Hispanics are disproportionately affected by cardio-metabolic disorders, but with a limited expectation of benefits from existing genomic-based algorithms. We will focus on clopidogrel to develop urgently-needed genomic-driven prescription guidelines for this population. To this purpose, we propose to perform the first ever GWAS of a pharmacogenetically actionable prescription drug in Caribbean Hispanics. Our proposal will also take a novel approach to definitively assess the admixture component and is also highly practical for the development of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool. We will implement a treatment algorithm to guide DAPT in Caribbean Hispanics and will create a repository of genomic DNAs and fully annotated clinical and genomic dataset from Caribbean Hispanics with cardiovascular diseases. Shaped by strong preliminary data, we will test the following hypothesis: There are unknown genetic variants that uniquely contribute to clopidogrel responsiveness in Caribbean Hispanics to such extent that a developed CDS tool that incorporates personal ethno-specific genotypes and ex vivo pharmacodynamic (PD) testing will help enable more precise recommendations for optimizing medical outcomes to antiplatelet therapy in this population.  The study will be conducted over 5 years in 1,000 cardiovascular patients treated with clopidogrel for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events. It is expected that this study advances the adoption of a Precision Medicine (PM) paradigm for the benefit of Hispanic patients. The richer genetic variance in Latinos is likely to contribute substantially to variability in response to drug treatments, a component that will be missed by traditional studies in homogeneous populations. This addressable oversight is of great concern, since it will tend to exacerbate the healthcare disparity already experienced by Hispanic populations in the US. Hispanics have been largely excluded from PM initiatives, which increase dramatically the disparities in translating benefits from new findings in pharmacogenomics to this medically underserved population, exacerbating the existing inequity in healthcare services. Accordingly, the proposed research will expand our current understanding on the pharmacogenomics of clopidogrel. Advancing knowledge in the under-investigated area of pharmacogenetics in minority populations will generate results that apply to personalize DAPT in the wider population as it moves, inevitably, toward increasing heterogeneity through admixed genomes."
"9360566","PROJECT ABSTRACT Reports estimate nearly 2 million unaccompanied homeless youth aged 13-24 in the United States each year.1 Nearly 40% of these youth were formerly a part of the foster care system.2 Research has demonstrated that homeless youth are at elevated risk for HIV3-10 and a separate body of research has reported elevated risk for HIV among foster and former foster youth.11-14 Thus, the accumulation of risk factors common to both homeless youth and former foster youth place this large population of homeless former foster youth in the nexus of life experiences that position them at extreme risk for engaging in a number of HIV risk behaviors, and necessitating an increase in intervention research to address the unique needs of this population. While interventions targeting HIV prevention efforts have focused on homeless youth, little research has focused on the impact of unique foster care experiences on HIV risk behaviors. And because studies have begun to discover the role of foster care in network disruption and network engagement10 and we know that HIV risk behaviors are impacted by network engagement,30 a need exists to better understand the network characteristics of homeless young adults with a history of foster care and associations between these characteristics, and HIV-risk behaviors. While current studies have examined some HIV risk behaviors by foster care status,10 limitations in the current data do not reflect the heterogeneity of foster care experiences. Based on our knowledge of the impact of networks on HIV risk behaviors, and the lack of research on the impact of foster care experiences on network engagement, the current state of the literature lacks a focus on the unique experiences of homeless former foster youth, and the ways these experiences impact network engagement and HIV risk behaviors, in order to better inform and adapt HIV interventions for homeless youth. The study?s goals include drastically increasing knowledge regarding HIV risk among homeless former foster youth. This study proposes primary data collection of a sample of homeless youth with a history of foster care, utilizing the data collection site and methods used in the quantitative survey data and social network data from an NIMH-funded R01 study (MH903336; PI: Rice). The use of primary data will provide a unique contribution to the literature and increase our understanding of the impact of foster care experience and network engagement on HIV risk among homeless youths. These findings will be used to inform new directions in homeless youth interventions; specifically what network-level interventions could be adapted to prevent HIV risks in the homeless former foster youth population. Training goals include in-depth coursework and mentoring to apply the findings of these results to intervention adaption and development focused on network-based HIV interventions for homeless former foster youth."
"9567350","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The chronic disease course of obesity reflects interactions between etiological traits and factors involved in maintenance, of which stress-induced hyperphagia offers unique prognostic value. Although occasional intake of high-calorie foods in response to stress does not directly cause obesity, for some, repeated exposure to stress triggers hyperphagic behaviors such that homeostatic pathways are overridden in favor of mesolimbic reward signaling, culminating in weight gain and obesity. In its most severe state, stress-induced hyperphagia may manifest as hyperphagic depression (or chronic stress-induced hyperphagia; increased appetite/weight gain in an episode). Stress-induced hyperphagic behaviors stem, in part, from disruption in mesolimbic regions governing reward. Despite data on abnormal dopamine (DA) signaling in obesity and mood disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic stress-induced hyperphagia remains poorly understood. Preclinical work supports involvement of ghrelin, a gut peptide primarily recognized for its orexigenic properties, in modulating DA transmission and reward signaling - a role recently corroborated in human obesity. We showed, in women with chronic stress-induced hyperphagia, that ghrelin was significantly related to self-reported reward capacity and stress-related eating, and to ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens activity in response to food reward. We hypothesize that chronic stress-induced hyperphagia is promoted by ghrelinergic signaling in response to psychosocial stress, and that these ghrelin-specific effects are significantly associated with differential reward activity in and connectivity between mesolimbic regions. This proposal will address the following Specific Aims: 1. To assess relationships between ghrelin and BOLD activity/connectivity related to food reward after psychosocial stress in chronic stress-induced hyperphagia, chronic stress-induced hypophagia, euphagic depression, and healthy controls; 2. To examine associations between ghrelin and BOLD activity/connectivity related to monetary reward in mesolimbic circuitry during reward anticipation/receipt after psychosocial stress in chronic stress-induced hyperphagia, chronic stress-induced hypophagia, euphagic depression, and healthy controls. We will study mesolimbic circuitry using functional MRI to measure BOLD activity and connectivity during food and non-food reward tasks following psychosocial stress in individuals with chronic stress-induced hyperphagia, chronic stress-induced hypophagia, euphagic depression, and healthy controls. Our study will identify acute and chronic effects of stress on relationships between ghrelin and brain reward circuitry, determine specificity of ghrelin-related reward potentiation to food or generalization beyond food-related reward, and explore associations between these variables and intake during ad libitum access to palatable foods. Understanding these effects will provide a mechanistic explanation for the maintenance of obesity in the context of triggers such as psychosocial stress, potentially informing the design of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments."
"9359221","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The field of childhood cancer research is at a crossroads. After stunning improvements, cure rates for most pediatric malignancies have plateaued. Indeed, children with metastatic solid malignancies continue to have less than a 50% chance of survival despite being treated with highly intensive chemoradiotherapy. Neuroblastoma (NB), a diverse malignancy arising from the developing sympathetic nervous system, is an outstanding model for the problem of childhood cancer in general and is the focus of this new Program Project Grant. The primary goal of this multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary Program is to achieve improved outcomes for patients with high-risk, disseminated NB by: 1) discovering basic mechanisms of resistance to modern therapies; 2) uncovering targetable vulnerabilities driving resistance; and 3) translating these insights into evidence-based clinical trials. The five proposed Projects focus on interrelated fundamental problems in the broad fields of genomics (Projects 1 and 2), epigenetics (Project 3), tumor microenvironment (all Projects) and immuno-oncology (Projects 1, 2, 4 and 5). The central hypothesis is that high-risk NBs evolve to evade therapeutic interventions but that these resistance mechanisms can be targeted therapeutically. The motivation for the proposed research is the urgent need to improve survival of patients with high-risk NB, and to decrease treatment-related morbidities. The five proposed Projects will each address three Specific Aims of the overall Program: 1) discover mechanisms of NB therapy resistance; 2) discover tumor-intrinsic and tumor- extrinsic therapeutic vulnerabilities imparted by therapy resistance; and 3) develop readily translatable therapeutic strategies to exploit de novo and acquired resistance mechanisms and molecular vulnerabilities. The Projects will each be supported by three Cores: A) Research Support Services; B) Clinical Trials and Translation; and C) Biostatistics. Unique to the Program is a mature clinical trials consortium integrated into Core B (New Approaches to NB Therapy [NANT] consortium). Critical to the success of each Project is unparalleled access to therapy resistant tumors from the NANT, and sharing of clinically relevant in vitro and murine models. Importantly, all Projects have clear milestones to deliver one or more clinical trials to the NANT, with Project specific studies designed to provide a portfolio of nonclinical data required for efficient translation to the refractory NB patient population. This highly integrated Program proposes a variety of innovative experimental strategies to uncover basic mechanisms of oncogenesis, kinome reprogramming, epigenetic adaptation and immune evasion, but is steadfastly translational, as the investigative team is constituted with physicians who care for children with this disease. The significance of the proposed program is the likely discovery of fundamental mechanisms of cancer therapy resistance leading to substantively improved probability of cure coupled with reduced therapy-related morbidity for children, adolescents and adults afflicted with high-risk NB."
"9484907","Leveraging Biocultural Mechanisms to Increase the Impact of Multi-level  Preventable Disease Interventions with Southwest Populations  Project Summary/Abstract The proposed U54 Specialized Center will advance knowledge on how to prevent cardiometabolic disease and substance abuse disorders among the health disparities populations of the Southwest. The Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center (SIRC) has accumulated invaluable expertise in this area for the past 10 years as ASU's Exploratory Center of Excellence (NIMHD/NIH P20MD002316). The stark unmet health needs of the Southwest communities, the strong transdisciplinary team of researchers assembled for this application, and the existing solid community partnerships make this application highly significant. The Specialized Center will leverage SIRC's accumulated knowledge on cultural and social determinants of health and health disparities and will integrate biological, sociocultural and other contextual factors into efficacious, culturally grounded and impactful health interventions. We will focus on understanding the protective and risk effects of interpersonal family and household factors, the community environment, and individual health behaviors on specific biological health outcomes. The Specialized Center will extend SIRC's integrated, multilevel, social determinants approach to include biocultural mechanisms within an Ecodevelopmental Theory framework. The proposed center will significantly enhance SIRC's research impact through a research focus on preventing cardio metabolic disease and substance abuse disorders through culturally appropriate and efficacious interventions. The proposed research is innovative because it will investigate how protective and risk factors that are common to various chronic diseases and disorders manifest themselves among racial/ethnic minority populations of the Southwest, with an emphasis on the sociocultural and biological determinants of health disparities. The two proposed main research projects will target potentially modifiable youth behaviors associated with cardiometabolic disease and with substance abuse disorders (i.e., physical activity, and quality of diet, access to healthy foods, family functioning, acculturation, substance use, and illegal drug availability). The resulting findings will inform the design and testing of efficacious interventions that can strengthen protective factors and counteract risk factors operating within the multiple ecological domains of a young person's life. The center will conduct the two related main research projects to increase the impact of efficacious interventions by advancing knowledge on how cultural processes influence biological vulnerabilities (i.e., biocultural mechanisms). Early career faculty and postdocs will increase their capacity to conduct health dipartites research through a comprehensive investigator development and pilots research incubator initiative. The center will implement the research projects and future pilots in close and equitable partnership with communities of the Southwest. In partnership with the SIRC Community Advisory Board, the center will broadly disseminate and translate the knowledge generated by the studies and pilots to policy, practice, and lay stakeholders through an innovative dissemination plan."

"9420328","DESCRIPTION: Dementia, especially Alzheimer's dementia (AD), is a growing public health problem with a prevalence of 5M in the US alone (33M worldwide). Despite a decrease in incidence rates, with the aging of the population, the prevalence of dementia is expected to increase to 16M in the US (115M worldwide) with associated costs rising to $1T. Delaying long-term care by 1 month for older Americans would save $60B annually in direct care cost. Efforts to prevent or delay dementia have been largely unsuccessful. However, major depressive disorder in late life (?late-life depression?, LLD) has been identified as one of six treatable risk factors for dementia, especially AD and vascular dementia. The depression-dementia relationship may be magnified in elders who do not respond to antidepressant treatment and experience persistent symptoms. Thus, resolving whether those with treatment-resistant late-life depression (TRLLD) are at higher risk of cognitive decline and progression to dementia compared to those with treatment-responsive LLD is critically important.  Leveraging a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded treatment study of N=1500 people with LLD, across 5 sites, we propose to comprehensively delineate neurocognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers associated with progression to dementia in people with persistent LLD (i.e., TRLLD) compared to those whose LLD remits with treatment. We anticipate enrolling 750 elders with LLD and characterizing their symptomatic trajectory over 24 months. We will assess each participant at three time points with neurocognitive and advanced neuroimaging. We hypothesize that changes in executive functions and the executive control network, as well as changes in episodic memory and the default mode/cortico-limbic network, will be greater in those with TRLLD than in those who respond to treatment and stay well. We also hypothesize that changes over two years in executive function and episodic memory will be specifically associated with changes in executive-control and cortico-limbic circuitry, respectively.  Based on our recent findings that inflammatory and related molecular markers can differentiate those with neurocognitive impairment and LLD from those with LLD alone, we will build a predictive multivariate model combining baseline neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and plasma protein data to determine who is at greatest risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Finally, we will also explore whether latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms can go beyond the dichotomy of remission/non-remission to identify subsets of elders with LLD at highest risk of cognitive decline, neural circuit change, and progression to dementia. This work will set the stage for neural circuit- targeted preventive care to delay dementia in subsets of older patients with LLD. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting the depression- dementia pathway and reduce suffering for large numbers of elders and their families."

These programs are supported by 9 shared resources. The past funding period has seen increased emphasis on developing our translational pipeline. Several resources have been put into place to support this effort and to better connect the basic programmatic research with the clinic. These resources include a Cancer Experimental Therapeutics Initiative to increase the number of investigator-initiated clinical trials at MCC, and the formation of translational working groups that bring together researchers, clinicians, and others in the oncology community to solve problems in organ-site-specific cancers. We have also established several mechanisms to increase the involvement of the community, and particularly the underserved populations in our catchment area, in clinical research. The MCC is a successful matrix organization in a large public research university that engages its faculty to focus on the problem of cancer. Our last period of support has been characterized growth, stability in our leadership, enhanced engagement of our community, and creation of several new cancer focused initiatives."
"9469965","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Ras superfamily of GTPases is a significant target for cancer therapeutics as oncogenic mutations are found in 20-30% of human cancers. Cysteine residues near the Ras C-terminus must undergo several post-translational lipid modifications, including farnesylation by farnesyltransferase (PFTase) and palmitoylation by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PAT), followed by consequent intracellular translocation and plasma membrane anchorage to propagate its cell signaling. As a result, PFTase inhibitors (FTIs) were designed to intercept this initial farnesylation process. Although FTIs have been largely unsuccessful in advanced clinical trials, post-prenylation Ras trafficking and interactions with effector and chaperone proteins are rapidly becoming the most important current therapeutic targets. To better understand these critical processes, this research proposal intends to incorporate photoactivatable cysteines into whole-Ras proteins using wavelength-selective two-photon photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs) and selectively activate farnesylation and palmitoylation of these proteins in cells to study both of these modifications independently. In Aim 1, the superior spatial and tissue- penetration capabilities of two-photon activated uncaging of nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF)-protected thiols will be probed by demonstrating localized, targeted drug delivery of NDBF-FTI in 2-D and 3-D cell culture. In Aims 2 and 3, a dimethylamine-derivatized NDBF (aNDBF) with a significantly red-shifted absorption profile will be synthesized, and the thiol-uncaging kinetics of aNDBF will be directly compared with NDBF after 700, 800, and 900 nm two-photon irradiation. The ability of these PPGs to be selectively photoactivated will be investigated by incorporating aNDBF- and NDBF-caged cysteines into Ras peptides. After initial in vitro characterization of selective cysteine uncaging, photoactivated farnesylation, palmitoylation, and intracellular translocation processes of a fluorophore-tagged caged Ras peptide will be observed in live cell microscopy experiments. Finally in Aim 4, modified caged peptides will be incorporated directly into Ras proteins using sortase-A mediated protein semi-synthesis techniques with a developed truncated GFP-N-Ras mutant. The two-photon-induced farnesylation-palmitoylation modification and trafficking kinetics of this engineered whole-Ras protein will be determined and compared with those found in Ras peptides. Furthermore, intermediate partially processed Ras forms are accessible for study by introducing additional structural features into the C-terminus peptide such as a nonhydrolyzable CaaX box and irreversible palmitoyl modification. The modularity of the developed GFP-N- Ras mutant peptide would allow for the incorporation of many different investigative components into the C- terminus of N-Ras and provides access to a broad selection of experiments that would not be possible using current methodologies. These studies will help direct current and future therapeutics development for Ras- derived cancers"
"9309969","Project Summary  One-third of adult Americans are afflicted with hypertension, a principal risk factor for a number of mortalities, including cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. The vast majority of hypertension remains uncontrolled, despite available therapies. There is a clear need to identify new targets for the treatment of hypertension. Increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes is associated with disruption of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure (BP), particularly in the setting of hypertension. BP should decrease, or ?dip?, at night when humans rest. Non-dipping hypertension is associated with negative cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke and kidney damage. Mechanisms underlying non-dipping hypertension are not understood but one candidate is the molecular circadian clock. The clock is comprised of several core transcription factors that regulate gene expression in nearly every cell type in the body. We have identified the circadian clock protein Per1 as an important regulator of gene expression in the kidney. The kidney plays a critical role in the regulation of sodium balance, blood volume, and therefore BP. Multiple sodium transporters, expressed throughout the renal nephron, contribute to these functions of the kidney. The kidney is responsive to the sodium-regulating mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone. The sodium/chloride cotransporter (NCC) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are expressed in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron and the collecting duct and are key determinants of renal sodium reabsorption and BP. Per1 is unique among the clock proteins because it is regulated by aldosterone. Per1 is also a novel regulator of NCC, ENaC and Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a peptide hormone that negatively regulates ENaC activity. We discovered that loss of Per1 affects the salt-sensitivity of BP and disrupts the circadian rhythm of BP, resulting in non-dipping hypertension. Taken together, our results suggest that Per1 may be a new therapeutic target for modulating BP and support a role for Per1 and the molecular kidney clock in the regulation of sodium balance and BP rhythms. The goal of this application is to test the hypothesis that Per1 regulates BP rhythms and sodium homeostasis through the coordinate regulation of NCC, ENaC, and ET-1 in the kidney. We have developed a novel, kidney-specific Per1 knockout mouse model to test this hypothesis. Aims 1 and 2 are designed to define the contribution of ENaC and NCC to Per1 action on renal sodium reabsorption and BP, whereas Aim 3 will define the role of ET-1 and its receptors in this regulation. Completion of these studies will, for the first time, specifically define the contribution of Per1 and the kidney clock to regulation of renal sodium handling and BP in a model of salt- sensitive hypertension. The studies proposed here have important implications for our understanding of mechanisms underlying non-dipping hypertension."
"9392488","Prevalence of systolic heart failure (HF) is high among the growing population of older adults1-3. Progressive cardiac remodeling and deteriorating cardiac output have been implicated as key factors underlying HF-related exercise intolerance and quality of life1. Even after implementing medical and device therapies that moderate remodeling, exercise tolerance remains impaired. While exercise training has been demonstrated to improve exercise capacity, mechanisms facilitating this benefit remain unclear. Peripheral adaptations in the skeletal muscle and vasculature provide at least some benefit, however reverse cardiac remodeling (beyond effects of pharmacological and device therapies) may be additive4-6. We propose to study the impact of 2 different types of exercise on cardiac morphology as well as systolic and diastolic performance and related functional gains. We will compare traditional aerobic training to a novel regimen of inspiratory muscle training (IMT). IMT is a specific type of exercise training that may be particularly useful for frail, infirmed HF patients who are unlikely to tolerate aerobic training. Effects of IMT on remodeling have not been previously studied.  The proposed echocardiography pilot study builds on a funded VA Merit F0834-R Exercise Therapy to Reduce Heart Failure Symptoms; Sorting Mechanisms of Benefit (PI, Forman) that compares different modes of exercise training in older (agee50yrs) systolic (EFd40%) HF patients. The original study assesses peripheral mechanisms affected by exercise training, but was not designed to assess cardiac remodeling. The proposed pilot study provides a vital complementary analysis, i.e., it adds assessments of cardiac remodeling as well as related changes in systolic and diastolic performance. Male and female (N=75) systolic HF patients (LVEF d40%) aged e50 years will be studied. Patients will be randomized into one of three groups (IMT [n=30] or aerobic [n=30] or control [n=15]). A comprehensive battery of functional assessments as well as echocardiographic examination will be performed before and after a 12-week, 3x/weekly regimen of aerobic training vs. IMT vs. usual care.  Specific Aims are (1) to analyze exercise training effects on left ventricular structure and function using conventional and novel indices of systolic and diastolic function. We hypothesize that exercise training will decrease left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and increase ejection fraction (EF) as well as regional strain compared to controls. (b) exercise training will increase mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e') as well as decrease the ratio (E/e') of early mitral inflow velocity (E) and e'. (c) IMT will be non-inferior to aerobic training in relation to anti-remodeling benefit and both forms of training will be superior compared to controls. (2). To explore the benefits of improved cardiac remodeling and physiology on functional and qualitative endpoints. We hypothesize (a) that exercise training-related cardiac improvements will lead to improved aerobic functional parameters (peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 slope). (b) that exercise training-related cardiac improvements will lead to improved aerobic functional parameters and improved quality of life (as measured by questionnaires)."
"9346658","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As natural products (NP) sales increase, the risk of adverse NP-drug interactions (NPDIs) increases, yet the pharmacokinetic (PK) elucidation and clinical relevance of putative NPDIs remain elusive. Assessing the risk of NPDIs is more challenging than that of drug-drug interactions (DDIs), often due to relatively scant PK knowledge of individual NP constituents that perpetrate these interactions. The proposed U54 Center will develop a roadmap for NPDI research through a series of well-designed human in vitro and in vivo studies (termed Interaction Projects) on 4-6 priority NPs that pose a potential risk for clinically relevant NPDIs. A repository will be developed for the data generated from the Interaction Projects, and results will be communicated to various target audiences through a public portal. This U54 Center is composed of an accomplished team of investigators, including pharmacokineticists with expertise in NPDIs, complemented by expertise in NP chemistry, DDIs, and health information communication. In collaboration with the Steering Committee, an innovative strategy that combines a mechanistic approach with practical considerations (e.g., popularity of the NPs) will be used to select and prioritize 4-6 NPs for further investigation in te Interaction Projects. Mechanistic aspects include curated clinical NDPI data from the widely used Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) of the Informatics Core, structural alerts, and compelling preliminary clinical and in silico NPDI data. Once selected, the NPs will be entered into a Decision Tree for assessment of NPDI liability and probable significance of interactions with victim drugs. In parallel, the Pharmacology Core will develop detailed Statements of Work for the human in vitro and in vivo studies - while the Analytical Core will source, acquire, and characterize the selected NPs - for the Interaction Projects. Upon completion of each project, the Analytical Core will analyze the PK samples, and the Pharmacology Core will develop physiologically-based PK models for further assessment of the clinical relevance of the Interaction Project results. Throughout these projects, the Informatics Core will create a data repository embedded within a public portal web-based application named, NaPDI app, for Natural Product-Drug Interaction application. The repository, built using the DIDB framework, will allow researchers to access both raw data and summarized results. The U54 Center will also develop and share Best Practices recommended for the conduct of NPDI studies, based on the experience with and results from the Interaction Projects, with the research communities via the public portal. Effective dissemination of the Interaction Project results will be ensured through user experience and brand content studies with target audiences - researchers/practitioners and lay public - to refine the public portal content. The Informatics Core will ensure that the U54 Center's results are archived, organized, analyzed, and well-publicized, allowing for improved design of future NPDI research and ultimately, improved decisions on the optimal management of clinically relevant NPDIs."
"9386348","ABTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of public health significance with high prevalence, high mortality rate and limited interventions. Advancement in genomic research offers an unprecedented opportunity to address the health challenges of SCD in an integrated manner. Cardiac involvement is common in sickle cell disease (SCD) and is associated with increased mortality. The main causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in SCD are chronic vaso-occlusion with ischemia and cardiac dysfunction, chronic hemolytic anaemia and secondary iron overload from chronic red blood cells transfusion. These culminate in the development of cardiac chamber dilation, and a compensatory increase in left ventricular (LV) mass; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, dysrhythmia and pulmonary hypertension (PH) leading to right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and sudden death. In addition, adults with SCD have significantly higher systolic and mean systemic blood pressures if they have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), than in those without PAH. The genetic susceptibility to the development of some of these CV abnormalities also seems to be related to the severe hemolysis in SCD. Although some genetic variants have been described to be associated with both PH and diastolic dysfunction in SCD, genetic studies associated with these echo-CV phenotypes have not been reported in SCD patients who reside in Africa. There is a need to provide a thorough appreciation of the genetic diversity that underlies CV phenotypic heterogeneity in SCD patients in Africa. Knowledge of these factors will help to identify genes and pathways that might be therapeutically manipulated in novel treatment approaches. The overarching goal of this study is to identify common genetic variants associated with diastolic dysfunction and PH in adults with SCD. This will be achieved through three inter-related specific aims. We will study large cohorts of adult SCD patients enrolled in a 4 institution in Nigeria and Tanzania. Specifically we will define the genome-wide genetic determinants of major echo-cardiovascular phenotypes (cardiac dilation, cardiac index, blood pressure, diastolic dysfunction, tricuspid jet regurgitation velocity (TRJV) and RV dysfunction) (Aim 1). We will determine whether genome-wide SNPs associated with the level of hemolysis cytoprotective proteins to be defined in a companion project to this application are linked to specific echo-CV phenotypes (Aim 2). Finally, we will functionally validate using transgenic sickle mice, the associations between the level of cytoprotective proteins and diastolic dysfunction, PH and relative systemic hypertension in SCD (Aim 3). This project will be the first characterizing genetics associated with diastolic dysfunction and PH in SCD patients residing in Africa. It will have high translational potential and may provide mechanistic insight into cardiac disease in SCD and suggest new therapeutic targets that can be exploited for clinical translation."

"9339551","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The brain receives time encoded signals whose information content is meaningful only if temporal sequences can be processed as a whole. This temporal binding process requires memory buffers, the nature and identity of which remain a mystery. Unraveling this mystery may provide insights for the pathogenesis and management of epilepsy, schizophrenia, and other neuro-psychiatric disorders. We postulate that the cellular substrates for these memory buffers are feedforward networks and that the molecular substrate for information storage is the bound- but-blocked state of the NMDA receptors.  In preliminary studies we have demonstrated a phenomenon we called Dendritic Hold and Read (DHR). It is based on the idea that the glutamate-bound but Mg2+-blocked state of the NMDA receptor is a quasi-stable state that holds information on the history of synaptic excitation. This information can be held for hundreds of milliseconds and then be conditionally retrieved with a second independent 'gating' depolarization to produce a local regenerative dendritic spike. In this proposal we will combine electrophysiology, optogenetics, and state-of- the-art optical technologies to show that DHR enables the operation of feedforward memory in the hippocampus. More specifically, we will test pharmacologic means to manipulate the duration of the elementary unit of short term memory (Specific Aim 1). We will show that theta rhythm serves as the endogenous clock that drives feedforward memory (Specific Aim 2). And we will attempt to demonstrate the time-to-space transform that is the fundamental principle of feedforward memory (Specific Aim 3).  This is a high risk, high reward proposal. The risk comes from proposing a totally novel theory of short term memory. This risk is counter balanced by compelling biophysical reasoning and abundance of preliminary data. The reward is in providing novel insights and treatment strategies for schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. It also provides insights into why distal dendrites are so excitable and epileptogenic."
"9563469","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Overall The University of Kentucky Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences (UK-CARES) will establish an Environmental Health Sciences Core Center to enhance research capacity focused on major environmental health impacts to air and water quality that have been implicated in environmentally induced disease. This Center will provide advanced infrastructure and leading expertise, dedicated career development and mentorship, and community-engaged interactions to facilitate innovative discovery and new understandings of environmental factors in disease initiation, progression, and outcomes and their community impacts. The central hypothesis is that toxic environmental agents are contributors to the disproportionately high incidence of chronic diseases, e.g., cancers, cardiopulmonary disease, and metabolic disorders in Appalachian Kentucky and that the impacts of early exposure are especially harmful. UK-CARES draws on a strong and diverse base of environmental health science and community-engaged research to build environmental health research capacity to meet the needs of communities in three Area Development Districts in southeastern Kentucky: Big Sandy, Kentucky River, and Cumberland Valley. Center members bring notable strengths in environmental health across four Research Interest Groups: Cardiopulmonary Diseases, Metabolic Disorders, Cancer, and Child Health and Early Life Exposures. To achieve the Center?s goal, UK-CARES will: 1) establish a rich research environment and a framework for transdisciplinary leadership and integrated infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and efficient use of resources for research expansion and development of new scientific directions; 2) build research capacity in environmental health sciences by providing an outstanding intellectual environment and advanced infrastructure to support innovation and community engagement; 3) recruit new talent and facilitate career development of investigators whose research addresses critical issues in environmentally induced disease through mentorship and structured career training activities; 4) develop multi-directional and mutually beneficial communications and interactions with community residents, policymakers, and public health/healthcare professionals to identify environmental concerns of target communities as a stimulus to new research; and 5) bridge the gap between discovery of novel research findings and population-level awareness and practice via community-focused science communication training. An Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core, Analytical Core, and Community Outreach and Engagement Core are integral to this effort and will catalyze multi-directional translation across the whole spectrum of research; provide advanced analytical support in metabolomics, computational biology, analytical chemistry, biospecimen management, and bioinformatics; and bridge Center and community priorities. Complementary activities in career development of scientists who are interested in tackling challenging environmental health questions and pilot project funding will support developing research and evolving scientific directions."
"9389597","The study of tumor-associated inflammatory factors is essential for determining the relationship between the tumor microenvironment and tumorigenesis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) within the tumor microenvironment have been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Despite the initial promise of T cell checkpoint inhibitor therapies in treating cancer patients, the immunosuppressive tumor-promoting microenvironment established by TAMs and MDSCs remains a major barrier to complete success. Using qPCR superarrays, we identified an important tumor factor, CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 4 (CMTM4), a member of the chemokine-like factor superfamily, which is highly expressed in human and mouse tumor cells and tissues. Preliminary studies showed that CMTM4 plays a significant role in the regulation of tumor-associated inflammation and establishment of a suppressive tumor microenvironment. siRNA knockdown (KD) of CMTM4 in tumor led to a significant reduction in tumor growth and angiogenesis in multiple tumor types. Myeloid specific CMTM4 deficiency results in significantly retarded tumor development in transplanted tumor models. Most interestingly, myeloid cells from CMTM4 KO mice skew toward M1 classical functional activation and maturation, which, in turn, plays an important role in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines and inflammation-related transcription factors (e.g. IL-6, TNFalpha, IL- 1beta, NFkappaB, HIF1alpha, IRF5, and IRF8). We hypothesize that CMTM4 is a key factor in controlling inflammatory signals and subsequently affects the tumor microenvironment through recruitment and differentiation of MDSCs toward an ?M2-like?, alternatively activated, phenotype that promotes angiogenesis and immune evasion, thereby facilitating tumor progression. Therefore, modulation of CMTM4-regulated inflammatory responses may convert an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment into an immune- conducive one. In this proposal, three specific aims will be pursued to test our hypothesis: 1) CMTM4 is the key driver that controls tumor inflammation. 2) Modulate the function of myeloid cells through CMTM4. Studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action utilized by CMTM4 are critical for clinical translation. CMTM4 KD can alter the tumor microenvironment, enhance anti-tumor immunity, and control tumor cell progression. Successful completion of these studies will lead to a better understanding of how our findings with mouse CMTM4 can be translated to human studies. The scientific information gained will have a significant impact on targeting TAMs/MDSC to revert the immune suppression associated with advanced malignancies and facilitate development of a novel therapeutic modality for the regulation of chronic inflammatory diseases."
"9444133","Project Summary: Project 4, Anatomical and Physiological Assays of Neuronal Interactions    Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The overall goal is to construct a neural circuit model of working memory and decisionmaking across multiple brain regions, constrained by neural activity, inactivation results, and connectivity. The model is already constrained by preliminary data showing choice-specific activity sequences in posterior cortical neurons in an evidence-accumulation task. This modeling will generate predictions, which will be tested by several techniques. The first approach will compare neural coding properties with anatomical connectivity by combining calcium imaging with serial-section electron microscopy. This aim will benefit from the Seung laboratory?s dramatic recent progress in automation by artificial intelligence, which will make it feasible to find connectomes of millimeterscale cortical volumes. The second approach will compare neural coding with physiological connectivity by combining calcium imaging with optogenetic perturbation at cellular resolution. This aim will leverage the Tank laboratory?s recent work on alloptical assays of connectivity. The third approach will be to study the role of interactions between cortical areas by performing calcium imaging in one area during optogenetic inactivation of another area. Much of this project focuses on retrosplenial cortex, which is of special interest because choicespecific activity sequences are more linear in this part of cortex than in other cortical areas. Furthermore, temporally specific inactivation of retrosplenial cortex causes behavior that mimics the response to deletion of incoming evidence. The first two approaches will test the example prediction that the local circuitry underlying activity sequences will exhibit sequential connectivity, that is, that connections from earlier to later neurons will be stronger or more frequent than those from later to earlier neurons. The third approach will test a second example prediction, that inactivation of the anterior M2 region of cortex will lead to reduction in nonspecific excitation in posterior cortices and alter sequence timing. Importantly, these example predictions are not intended to be comprehensive. Instead the generality of these techniques will enable researchers to test a wide variety of predictions that emerge from the neural circuit models that will be generated and refined based on data from these experiments and other components of the project."

"9410170","Project Summary There has been a tremendously increasing interest in the use of small animals such as zebrafish in drug discovery. A number of recent studies have proposed the use of zebrafish in drug discovery workflows, where they could be used to test drug candidates prior to being tested on expensive mammalian models. One significant advantage that zebrafish brings, is the ability to test entire compound libraries in a high throughput screening (HTS) fashion, a task not easily accomplished using conventional mammalian models. Using zebrafish in drug discovery could therefore decrease the chances of drug candidate failures in the preclinical stage itself. Despite these advantages, tools that allow HTS in zebrafish are not established. Most commonly used devices (96-well plates) that were designed specifically for cell- and enzyme-based screening, suffer from a number of artifacts when applied to motile organisms such as zebrafish. Microscale technologies has been shown to have potential to alleviate some of these difficulties. However, these technologies are complex and require precise fluidic control, issues which hamper their commercial adoption. In this proposal, we present the use of our novel and easy-to-use millifluidic device that can efficiently handle, load, align and manipulate zebrafish embryos. Our proposed device will streamline zebrafish based screening, and will be amenable to automation and mass production because of simple yet robust design. In order to adapt our technology to screen zebrafish, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Develop and optimize an integrated millifluidic device for consistent loading, dechorionation, mounting, healthy culture, and establish imaging procedures for zebrafish embryos; and (2) Test and compare feasibility of drug screening on zebrafish larvae in the millifluidic device. Robustness of our device will be tested and results will be compared with conventional well plates as reported in literature. These studies will demonstrate a proof-of-concept for the use of our device in handling and screening of zebrafish."

"9348409","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of long-term disability in active-duty personnel and Veterans. Improvements in body armor have greatly reduced injuries to the vital organs and advances in emergency surgery have saved countless lives. Unfortunately, neurological dysfunctions following TBI represent one area where relatively little progress was made. TBI ranging from mild (concussions) to severe are produced in large numbers on the modern battlefield, especially as result of exposure to improvised explosive devices (IED) and paradoxically, improvements in other areas of emergency care has greatly increased the numbers of warfighters that live to experience the long-term negative effects of TBI. In spite of significant research efforts, no treatments for TBI have been shown to be to be clinically effective. At present, most acute post-TBI care is limited to supportive interventions and avoidance of repeat injuries with the hope that unaided physiological repair mechanisms will, over time improve the neurological dysfunctions. Unfortunately, large numbers of Veterans that have suffered TBI are left to cope with chronic neurological deficits including motor and cognitive impairments. It is imperative to propose and validate therapeutic strategies that would positively impact this large group of patients of particular importance to the VA system. Research has shown that TBI initiates multiple cascades of secondary molecular changes that cause delayed and progressive tissue damage, which lead to neurological dysfunction. Both intrinsic neuronal cell death mechanisms and secondary neurotoxicity following neuroinflammation are thought to contribute to the neuronal loss following brain trauma. Although much of the research focus has been directed at elucidating relatively early cellular and molecular events, experimental evidence suggests that the pathobiological processes initiated by TBI may continue for as long as a year or more after trauma- contributing to progressive neurodegeneration and chronic neurological deficits. Recent evidence suggests that persistent neuroinflammation following central nervous system (CNS) trauma lasts for months and even years, and may be responsible for chronic neurodegeneration and chronic neurological dysfunction. The goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate that the chronic secondary injury processes initiated by TBI and the secondary neurological deficits are not irreversible and represent a prime target for therapeutic intervention. This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that delayed exercise and/or pharmacologic approaches targeting key secondary injury mechanisms can effectively reduce neuronal loss and neuroinflammation, and promote neuroplasticity responses resulting in attenuation of neurological dysfunction following TBI. The proposed studies designed to test our hypothesis will use a well-established animal experimental model of TBI, controlled cortical impact (CCI) in mice. This experimental TBI model mimics key pathophysiological mechanisms of the clinical TBI, and successful validation of our hypotheses in this model should increase the probability of clinical application. The proposed studies will determine: 1) Late exercise initiated after brain trauma attenuates neurological dysfunction, reduces chronic neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation following experimental TBI; 2) Late GGA administration initiated after brain trauma attenuates neurological dysfunction, reduces chronic neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation following experimental TBI; 3) Late PJ34 administration initiated after brain trauma attenuates neurological dysfunction, reduces chronic neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation following experimental TBI; and 4) Late combination intervention including the administration PJ34 or GGA with exercise after brain trauma attenuates neurological dysfunction, reduces chronic neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation following experimental TBI.  ."
"9377471","Project Summary Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated with significant costs to both the individual and society. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk of AUDs and excessive drinking, and a better understanding of the specific risk genes will allow for novel strategies for prevention and treatment. Glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) is a new target in alcohol research identified previously by rodent studies in our lab. Overexpression of Glo1 increases binge-like drinking in mice, suggesting involvement in excessive alcohol intake. The endogenous substrate of GLO1, methylglyoxal (MG), acts as a partial agonist at GABAA receptors. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations that increase MG levels (i.e. GLO1 inhibition, Glo1 gene knockdown) have been shown to reduce binge-like drinking in mice, providing a possible mechanism through which GLO1 modifies alcohol consumption. The goal of this fellowship project is to determine the role of Glo1 and other potential related genetic risk factors for excessive drinking in a mouse model of binge-like intake. Aim 1 will use a novel breeding strategy to generate an F1 panel of inbred mice overexpressing Glo1 on different genetic backgrounds. These mice will be phenotyped for alcohol binge-like drinking. A two-part genome wide association study will be used to 1) map epistatic modifiers of Glo1 that enhance or suppress its effects on alcohol drinking, and 2) identify potential quantitative trait loci associated with binge-like drinking. Aim 2 will investigate why Glo1 modifies alcohol intake, by testing the hypothesis that changes in Glo1 expression alter sensitivity to the reward-enhancing effects of alcohol or alcohol aversion. Together, these experiments will give us a better understanding of how Glo1 overexpression contributes to risk of excessive drinking, and will highlight other genes that modify this risk. This dual approach may identify novel targets and strategies for preventing or treating drinking to intoxication"
"9552414","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to a request for applications for the Continuation of ChiLDReN, the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network. Over the past ten years, through a coordinated effort, investigations of eight cholestatic pediatri disorders have been advanced and we have established a robust database and biorepository for further research. Little is known about the pathogenesis, natural history, and optimal treatment strategies for the rare pediatric liver diseases investigated by ChiLDReN. We at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) propose to continue to participate in this Consortium, and thereby advance the field through collaborative research. Only through collaboration can we improve the quality and efficiency of care provided to all individuals diagnosed with one of the diseases studied by this network. CHOP has been a highly productive member of ChiLDReN for the last 10 years. In this application, we propose to continue our participation in all aspects of the ChiLDReN consortium, including clinical trials, observational study protocols, dissemination of research findings and ancillary studies. We also propose to continue genetic screening of patients with Alagille Syndrome in the laboratory of Dr. Nancy Spinner. In addition, we have included a proposal for Genetics and Pathology services that we can offer to the Network. Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive idiopathic, necroinflammatory disease of the extrahepatic biliary tree that presents in infancy, and accounts for 50% of all pediatric liver transplantations in the U.S. Currently there is no accurate way to predict outcome in children with BA at the time of diagnosis. A reliable algorithm for predicting clinical outcome would be valuable in defining prognosis and stratifying patients in clinical trials. In addition, improved understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would promote the development of novel therapies. In our scientific proposal, we will test the hypothesis that genomic and proteomic factors can predict outcome in BA. Using existing genotyping data from our group, we will conduct a genome wide association study of BA patients to identify significant single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants that modify disease outcome. We will compare the variants detected in children with biliary atresia who survived with native liver beyond two years of age to those who did not. We also propose in depth studies to investigate the functional consequences of the variants identified in the GWAS. As a complementary strategy, we will use advanced proteomic technologies to identify serum proteins that predict clinical outcome in BA. Our study will leverage the extensive clinical and genomic data and biospecimens already collected by the ChiLDREN consortium to identify genetic modifiers and protein biomarkers that can predict outcome in this devastating disease. Our investigative team has the expertise and track record necessary to conduct these experiments. We anticipate that this work will contribute new knowledge about the biologic pathogenesis of BA and accelerate the pace of research into new treatments."
"9463256","PROJECT SUMMARY: The bone marrow is the major site of hematopoiesis where all blood cells emerge from the regulated differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Studies from the applicant?s laboratory have uncovered key functions for innervation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the egress of HSCs from marrow. SNS nerves are required to entrain the circadian release of HSCs and also the circadian recruitment of mature leukocytes to the periphery. In addition, the bone marrow is also innervated by peptidergic sensory fibers whose functions in hematopoiesis remain unclear. In this application, we propose a 3-year experimental plan that will advance our knowledge on the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the bone marrow. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the functions of sensory nerves in the marrow. We will define the functional neural circuits using immunofluorescence imaging and transneuronal viral tract tracing, and evaluate the interplay of signals between sensory and SNS fibers using pharmacological and genetic model systems. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify the intercellular transduction pathways that relay SNS nerve signals in bone marrow. We will identify the stromal cell types that receive adrenergic signals mediating ROS oscillations which may represent an important link for the propagation of neural signals. Specific Aim 3 will harness endogenous neural circuits to improve hematopoietic regeneration. We will establish selective bone marrow DREADDs using adenoviral transduction that will lead to organ-specific neural activation to enhance regeneration following genotoxic insults such as ionizing irradiation or chemotherapy. Manipulation of endogenous neural circuits may indeed provide a useful future strategy to accelerate hematopoietic regeneration. !"

"9377315","PROJECT SUMMARY: Using human brain connectivity to identify the causal neuroanatomical substrate of depression symptoms Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and new treatments are needed. Identifying the brain regions causing depression symptoms can lead to treatment targets and better therapies. However, identifying these regions has been difficult. Neuroimaging of patients identifies brain areas where activity correlates with depression symptoms, but can?t determine whether these regions actual cause symptoms. Animal models allow for causal manipulations, but only approximate human symptoms. The goal of this grant is to link depression symptoms to human neuroanatomy in a causal way. Here I focus on two sources of information that can provide theses causal neuroanatomical links. The first is patients with focal brain lesions causing depression symptoms. The second is patients with depression who have received focal brain stimulation for symptomatic relief. In both cases, there is a causal link between symptoms and the site of the lesion or stimulation. However, this causal link can be indirect. Lesion-induced symptoms can come from brain regions connected to the lesion location rather than the lesion location itself. Similarly, benefits of brain stimulation can come from modulation of distant regions connected to the site of stimulation. As such, utilizing these causal sources of information requires a map of human brain connectivity. Due to NIH initiatives like the human connectome project and high powered MRI scanners, such maps are now available. I?ve recently developed a technique that uses these brain connectivity maps to better localize lesion-induced symptoms and identify regions mediating response to focal brain stimulation. Because this technique utilizes existing connectivity data, it does not require connectivity imaging of the patients themselves. As such, the technique can be applied to any lesion or stimulation dataset and has already lent insight into a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Here, I leverage this technique to identify brain regions causing depression symptoms (Aim 1) and brain regions mediating anti-depressant response to focal brain stimulation (Aim 2). Successful completion of these aims will lend insight into the causal neuroanatomical substrate of depression symptoms. Such knowledge will facilitate identification of biomarkers for evaluating future therapies, optimal therapeutic targets for invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation, and individualized targets based on patient-specific symptom profiles. These treatment targets can then be empirically tested in future therapeutic trials."
"9413855","PROJECT SUMMARY  Advancements in the field of microscopy and imaging have pushed the boundaries of what was once thought possible in many fields of research. New techniques coupled with the application of new technologies allows researchers to probe further and with greater accuracy to answer increasingly complex questions. While these new techniques allow for far greater specificity of observation and increased sensitivity in regard to both resolution and frequency, the amount of data generated is increasing to a point where conventional systems are unable to manage it. At the current time, there is no practical way to analyze, mine, share or interact with large (100+TB) brain image datasets. The development of a national, scalable archival solution for such datasets is a pressing problem extremely important and central to the NIH mission as in the future there will be a continuous and sustained growth in data scale. To address this issue, this proposal establishes the BRAIN Imaging Archive (or more simply ?the Archive?) data service in Pittsburgh PA as a collaboration of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC), the University of Pittsburgh (PITT), and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The Archive encompasses the deposition of datasets, the integration of datasets into a searchable web- accessible system, the redistribution of datasets, and a computational enclave to allow researchers to process datasets in-place and share restricted and pre-release datasets. The Archive will, for the first time, provide researchers with a practical way to analyze, mine, share or interact with large (100+TB) image datasets by creating a unique public resource for the BRAIN research community."
"9547073","MODIFIED ABSTRACT Genomic discovery is moving rapidly from genotyping approaches to large scale sequencing studies to capture the full breadth of genetic variation. Our proposal to create a Central Sequencing and Genotyping (CSG) facility combines key strengths of two leading laboratories in the clinical genomics space, the Partners Laboratory for Molecular Medicine (LMM) and the Broad Institute. Together, we propose to (a) create a seamless CLIA-grade process for generating and interpreting genomic sequence data for eMERGE III, (b) to return clinically interpreted results to eMERGE sites and (c) provide infrastructure to manage these results over time as new information emerges. In addition, raw data and annotations will be transferred to the eMERGE Coordinating Center (CC) and/or deposited in a portal housed and managed by Baylor College of Medicine to enable aggregate data analyses for novel discoveries. This proposal capitalizes on the Broad Institute's expertise in high throughput genomic sequencing and data analysis and on LMM's expertise in clinical genomic result interpretation as well as its knowledge management infrastructure and experience in returning clinical reports and knowledge updates to providers. LMM's genetic knowledge base is housed by GeneInsight Lab (GIL), as well as GeneInsight Clinic (GIC), an application that supports electronic return of results, automated patient specific clinical knowledge updates and options for electronic health record (EHR) integration. The PIs of this application are members of other NHGRI consortia and organizations developing standards in genomics, which will facilitate rapid and seamless exchange of best practices to support the translation of genomics into medical practice."
"9398459","Project Summary  More than 700 million women globally have married before the age of 18. In fact, one in three girls in developing countries marry before the age of 18. However, gaps in understanding associations between girl child marriage, a formal union of a female under age 18, and health outcomes remain. Research on girl child marriage has found negative associations with maternal, reproductive, and mental health; however, little is known about its relationship to malnutrition, a leading cause of maternal and child deaths. Additionally, girl child marriage may negatively affect the health of her children. Limited literature has found associations with child diarrhea incidence, underweight, and stunting, yet results are inconsistent across studies. Moreover, there is a dearth of research on the effects of girl child marriage in sub-Saharan Africa, where 16 of the 20 countries with the highest prevalence of early marriages are located. These create research gaps that prevent developing evidence-based policies to improve the health of women and their children.  The overall objective of this proposed study is to examine mechanisms through which girl child marriage affects the health and well-being of women and their children in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the relative magnitude and impact of these mechanisms. This proposal specifically aims to: (1) estimate the associations between girl child marriage and nutritional status among women in sub-Saharan Africa, and (2) quantify the intergenerational effects of girl child marriage by identifying differences in early development and health among children born to women who marry early as compared to after age 18 in sub-Saharan Africa. This proposed study is the first, as far as the authors know, to assess the relationship between girl child marriage and the early development of their children (across cognitive, language, physical, and socioemotional domains).  Using all available household data from African countries participating in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) (1991 to 2014) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (2009 to 2014), research aims will be studied through designing and testing a series of models using regression analyses. Exploring girl child marriage, one psychosocial risk factor, can impact investigation into other social risks that influence child and adolescent health and development. Research findings will, moreover, provide timely data and evidence to guide policies that support the NICHD?s mission to ensure that children and women achieve their developmental potential.  The proposed research training plan will support applicant Ms. Yvette Efevbera?s aspirations to become a leader and scholar on child and adolescent health and development. As a doctoral student in the Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Ms. Efevbera aspires to strengthen her content area knowledge, quantitative methodological skillsets, and ultimately position herself to be a successful independent researcher, with long-term interest informing child and adolescent health policy."
"9380286","Abstract Metal orthopedic implants are common devices used for restoring musculoskeletal joint function and patient mobility. Given the large number of orthopedic joint reconstructions conducted each year, it is important to minimize rates of aseptic implant loosening which causes pain and often leads to revision surgery. Therapeutics that modify endogenous epigenetic processes are promising for the treatment of many musculoskeletal disorders, including osteopenia and osteoporosis, yet the delivery mode and molecular mechanisms that act to diminish clinical symptoms are in need of further investigation. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that osseointegration of orthopedic implants can be improved by modulating the biological properties of endogenous skeletal repair cells using epigenetic inhibitors. Based on recent preliminary data, this amended proposal has evolved to address the specific working model that epigenetic drugs can be used to stimulate paracrine signaling (e.g., BMP2 activity) to drive endogenous skeletal repair cells into the osteoblast lineage. New data I generated show that human mesenchymal stromal cells (both adipose and bone tissue-derived) attach to porous metal orthopedic implants, as well as proliferate and deposit an extracellular matrix. Additional preliminary data reveal that Ezh2 inhibition can bolster the differentiation of MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts, both in vitro and in vivo. Based on these preliminary data, this study will (i) determine the in vivo effects of Ezh2 delivery before, during or after reconstructive orthopedic surgery (Aim 1), and (ii) examine the mechanism of Ezh2 inhibition by measuring the effects of blocking paracrine signaling (e.g., BMP2) on osteoblast differentiation in vitro (Aim 2). My long term goals are to develop strategies for localized delivery of bone anabolic therapeutic reagents to address the increasing demands of an expanding, aging, and increasingly active human population. These studies should ultimately lead to the development of surgeon- assembled adjuvants and become part of routine orthopedic practices, as well as support my career progression as an independent investigator capable of executing clinically relevant translational research similar to that proposed here."
"9381901","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A growing body of research indicates that siblings have marked influence on adolescents' alcohol and other substance use. Results from genetically informed designs reveal that concordance between siblings in these domains exceeds the influence of shared genetics and shared environments, including parenting, suggesting that sibling similarities arise via some form of social influence. Despite strong evidence that siblings are unique socializers of substance use, research on the mechanisms driving these associations is underdeveloped. There is a critical need to identify those processes that influence adolescents' decisions regarding substance use. The lack of mechanistic understanding precludes informed development of family-based behavioral intervention strategies. Thus, rooted in ecological and family systems frameworks, we propose an integrative theoretical framework of sibling influence and identify the micro- and global-social influence processes that account for sibling similarities and differences. Additionally, taking a developmental perspective, we will identify the dual trajectories and reciprocal associations between older and younger siblings' substance use behaviors and related cognitions from early through late adolescence. This advance is critical, as previous work has only considered top-down (i.e., older to younger sibling) socialization. Testing ecological principles, we will also investigate the degree to which community characteristics moderate the influence of sibling socialization and youth's substance use more generally. The sample will include 600 sibling pairs and their residential parents (~2220 participants). Using address based sampling strategies, we will recruit families that include a focal older sibling in grades 8-10 (~13-16 years of age) and a sibling up to three grades younger (~12-15 years of age). Using an accelerated longitudinal within-family design with planned missingness, participants will be followed over the course of two years (i.e., three annual assessments). Two data collection methods will be employed at each assessment. First, annual internet-based computer assisted self-interviews (CASI) with parents and youth will assess participants' alcohol and other substance use and related cognitions, psychosocial functioning, and peer, parent and sibling relationship qualities. Second, a series of internet-based diary interviews will be completed by younger and older siblings. Over four consecutive weekends, these interviews will assess the content of siblings' daily interactions as well as the contexts and companions of their activities (including substance use). In general, the aims will be tested using latent variable modeling (LVM). This flexible analytic procedure is advantageous as it can handle both diary and longitudinal data which are nested within individuals as well as data from siblings which are further nested within families. Furthermore, LVM permits the efficient testing of mediating and moderating effects as well as growth trajectories and reciprocal effects. By identifying specific mechanisms of sibling influence, this study will provide important information about new targets for family-based interventions to reduce adolescent substance use."

"9422293","ABSTRACT: The impact of Molecular Imaging on oncology encompasses all aspects of clinical management including early detection, guiding the preclinical development of targeted therapeutics and biomarkers, assisting staging of disease and monitoring response to therapeutics. Utilization of Molecular Imaging can significantly decrease the costs incurred with the development of new therapies by allowing accurate patient treatment stratification and allowing the non-invasive serial assessment of the biological response to treatment in vivo. However, a significant bottleneck has emerged for the development and translation of molecular imaging agents, specifically those utilized for positron emission tomography (PET probes). Current limitations for the rapid development and translation of targeted molecular imaging agents for PET include but are not limited to; the complex design, synthesis and screening approaches for both targeted ligand identification and imaging agent development. As such there is clearly a growing need for exceptional laboratory-based scientists with extensive research experience in the field of bioimaging research, more specifically in the case of Dr Hausner radiochemistry and probe optimization for molecular imaging PET probes. Scientists such as Dr Hausner provide the continuity, stability and detailed scientific knowledge to students and trainees far beyond that of a technician and are vital to sustain the molecular imaging research enterprise. This funding is an excellent opportunity to recognize Dr Hausner?s contributions, not only to the Sutcliffe laboratory but also to molecular imaging research. It will also allow him to develop a more defined and stable career path to pursue research in basic, translational, and clinical molecular imaging research within the Sutcliffe research program without the pressure of becoming an independent investigator. Dr Hausner will continue to support the development of targeted molecular imaging agents for cancer detection in the Sutcliffe laboratory and more specifically focus on improving the pharmacokinetics of peptide based molecular imaging agents. Molecular imaging agents under development in the Sutcliffe laboratory support pre-clinical studies in mice and non-human primates at the Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging, as well as clinical studies through the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Department of Radiology. Dr Sutcliffe is the primary support Unit Director who will continue to work with Dr Hausner to plan, direct and monitor the proposed research."

Much of this work  concerns the development and application of arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI, a method initiated by  our Regional Resource (1). ASL provides noninvasive quantification of tissue perfusion (blood flow). In brain,  cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantifies cerebrovascular function, but CBF also serves as a means of quantifying  neural function more generally through the tight coupling between CBF and regional neural activity (2, 3). Over  the past project period, TRD2 further developed ASL MRI technologies and applications at 3T and at 7T.  Additional neuroimaging technology developed by TRD2 included imaging of myelin and myelin water,  susceptibility weighted imaging, and the development of new signal-processing strategies for both functional  and structural MRI of the brain. TRD2 also collaborated with TRD1 on metabolic imaging of the brain and with  TRD4 on optical monitoring of CBF and metabolism in the brain.

"9386632","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Biomedical Research Core works in synergy to enhance bidirectional enhancement of research and flow of data. The Cell Biology, Pathology, and Imaging Core (Core C) holds a central and critical place in phenotyping in conjunction of the Physiology Core (Core). Core C will serve renal investigators in several areas: 1. Pathology. 2. Cell Biology. 3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For Pathology, we provide infrastructure, equipment, service, and education on all standard techniques but we remain flexible for innovative and novel procedures as the need arises. For Cell Biology, we offer to train investigators to perform confocal imaging in fixed and live cells and allow them access to a state-of-the art microscopy suite. For whole animal Imaging, we offer standard MR- based anatomic imaging, cardiac imaging for anatomy and cardiac function, and a wide variety of renal functional MRI to measure a number of physiology and pathophysiologic parameters. We offer our assistance at three levels depending on the nature of what is required to achieve the scientific endpoint. For the highly standard established procedure, it is offered as a service where the investigators pay a small non- profit cost recovery fee and the results are delivered in mutually agreed time frames. e.g. sectioning and H&E stains. The Core will be cited but Core Directors will not be co-authors on any resultant manuscripts. For less frequently used and more technical assays, the assistance will be provide as a collaboration. There will be clearly defined deliverables with no charge but joint authorship is expected. e.g. functional MRI to measure renal blood flow, oxygenation, and apparent diffusion coefficient of water (surrogate of fibrosis/cell infiltrate). Finally, studies can be performed as an exploration where the investigators work with the Core Directors to discovery new territories. e.g. spectral computed tomography. The Cell Biology, Pathology, and Imaging Core remains one of cornerstones of phenotyping in the O'Brien Center. In addition to transitional ?workhorse? assays, we continuously explore new territories to advance the technology. The Core contributes significantly to the mission of the O'Brien Center to conduct research in the themes of kidney development and genetics, physiology and pathophysiology, and chronic kidney disease and its complications, with the long term goal of improving diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases."
"9538330","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Attempts to combat HIV have been hampered due to the virus's ability to rapidly mutate and produce genetic variants that can circumvent the immune response and resist drug therapy. The tremendous genetic diversity of HIV has greatly complicated the already daunting task of producing an effective vaccine for a virus capable of spreading through cell to cell contact and concealing its genetic material in the proviral state within populations of dormant reservoir cells. Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) has been a powerful tool for treating HIV patients but it has not effectively reached the most vulnerable populations, while resistance to many of the drugs used in HAART has inevitably emerged. Alternative approaches will be necessary in the future to help control and overcome HIV infections and AIDS. This application aims to contribute to these goals by more clearly defining the mechanism of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) fidelity and examining the effect of physiological conditions on fidelity and the utilization of commonly used RT inhibitors. Experiments that show how RT biochemistry occurs under cellular conditions indicate that current literature on RT fidelity and interactions with drugs like AZT and ddC is misleading. Results from the proposed experiments will more clearly define how RT works in the cell making it easier to develop and evaluate potential new drugs. A novel approach for crystallization of HIV RT using primer-template mimics that bind very tightly to RT is also demonstrated in collaboration with Dr. Eddy Arnold's group at Rutgers. This method allows for the first time, rapid crystallization of RT in the absence of cross-linking and leads to the formation of catalytically active crystals that can be treated with RT inhibitors to investigate the structure o the RT-inhibitor complexes. Information can be used for structure-based design of novel RT inhibitors. Aptamers (nucleic acids that bind extremely tightly to target proteins) can potentially be used for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, such as replacements of antibodies in biochemical assays (e.g. ELISA), utilization as biosensors, as tools for studying virus molecular biology, and as models for antiviral drugs. Aptamers specific to HIV and other retroviruses have been shown to inhibit virus replication in cell and animal models. In this proposal, a new class of aptamers to HIV RT that are composed of Xeno nucleic acids (XNA) will be tested for viral inhibition along with the novel primer-template mimicking aptamers used for crystallization above. XNAs are composed of nucleotide mimics that resemble normal nucleotides but contain unique chemical and structural modification that differentiate them from normal nucleotides. XNA aptamers are unique because the unnatural structure of the nucleoside is less susceptible to degradative enzymes and other harsh conditions, while they are also less likely to be recognized by the innate immune system than current RNA and DNA aptamers."
"9547598","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Approximately 800,000 individuals suffer a stroke each year in the United States. Development of Glial Growth Factor 2 (GGF2) for promotion of stroke recovery is significant because of the lack of therapeutics to treat stroke. GGF2 also has a very wide treatment window (days) because it is not dependent upon neuroprotection. Additionally, as GGF2 is already in clinical trials for another indication, barries to manufacturing, formulation and toxicology have either been eliminated, or greatly reduced. The innovative aspect of this application comes from leveraging the existing development work that has been completed with GGF2 for another indication to efficiently enable an IND for stroke. Expanding on a significant body of preclinical data, GGF2 dosing will be optimized in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model. Studies will explore dose frequency, extended dose duration and determine permanence of effects. Additional toxicology will be performed to enable the specific dose regimen proposed for stroke. GGF2 efficacy will then be confirmed in an established non-human primate model of cortical ischemia using a gyrencephalic rhesus monkey model. This model emphasizes neurorecovery rather than lesion volume reduction. Dosing will begin 24 hours after ischemia and behavioral improvements will be followed for at least 8 weeks in both rat and monkey studies. Following completion of studies in rhesus monkey an IND will be filed with the FDA."

"9420089","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently for lymphoma patients, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/ computed tomography (CT) is used for interim restaging or therapy monitoring after 1-4 cycles of chemo-/chemoimmunotherapy. An excellent negative predictive value (NPV) of > 80% with only a moderate positive predictive value (PPV) of between 25%- 70% has been reported. It has been shown that a substantial portion of the false-positive FDG-PET findings in this setting were caused by early post-therapy inflammatory changes. This hampers the accuracy and reliability of this test and, hence, its acceptance as an early prognostic tool in the clinical practice setting. An important recent advance in the area of molecular imaging of lymphoma is the development of the PET tracer18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) as an in vivo marker of cell proliferation. FLT uptake in lymphomas has been shown to be proportional to the Ki-67 index, a recognized histopathological marker of cell proliferation and since less affected by postherapy inflammatory changes caused by macrophages/monocyte infiltration, it is also a more tumor-specific tracer when compared to FDG. This higher tumor- specificity may be advantageous in early response assessment following chemo-/chemoimmunotherapy, radiation therapy (RT) or combined modality therapy. In this application, we propose to compare the predictive values of interim FLT- PET/CT and FGD-PET/CT in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients after 2 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. Our hypothesis is that FLT-PET/CT will have a substantially higher PPV when compared to FDG-PET/CT (i.e., e 91% vs. d 68%) while providing a similar or only slightly lower NPV and, therefore, prove superior to FDG-PET in this setting. We propose to prospectively study 137 DLBCL patients at 5 institutions. Study patients will be scanned by FLT-PET/CT and FDG-PET/CT 18-24 days after the second cycle of R-CHOP. After completion of six cycles of chemotherapy, conventional staging methods (CSM) will be performed in all patients to assess response and determine appropriate patient management. Patients will be followed for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for at least 24 months post- therapy or until definite determination of persistent disease (by biopsy) or disease progression (both considered an event). Specifically, we intend to: 1. Investigate whether the PPV of FLT-PET/CT is significantly higher (i.e., e 91% vs. d 68%) than that of FDG-PET/CT by following-up patients for at least 24 months posttherapy or until evidence of or disease progression. 2. Investigate whether the EFS of patients with FDG-PET/CT-positive and FLT-PET/CT negative scans is not significantly lower than that of patients with concordantly negative FDG-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT scans (i.e., < 65% vs. 85%) and, therefore confirming that the NPV of FLT-PET/CT is similar to that of FDG-PET/CT. 3. Correlate interim FLT- PET/CT and FDG-PET/CT with the International Prognostic Index (IPI), a well-established predictor of outcome in DLBCL. The demonstration of superiority of FLT-PET/CT over FDG-PET/CT is expected to lead to greater confidence in using interim PET in patient management. This increased reliability could potentially even render repeat biopsy unnecessary for midtherapy treatment decisions. This would represent a significant advance in the use of PET imaging for personalized therapy with an expectedly positive impact on patient management and/or outcome of patients with DLBCL."
"9436115","Retinol dehydrogenase 10 (Rdh10) catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) biosynthesis from retinol by generating retinal, which retinal dehydrogenases convert into atRA. Most Rdh10 research has focused on the visual cycle or embryonic development. Limited work has been done on postnatal Rdh10 function. Yet, atRA controls the fate of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into adipocytes vs osteoblasts in the adult to regulate adiposity and bone health. Mechanisms of atRA action in directing MSC differentiation remain unclear as does regulation of atRA biosynthesis. The literature contains conflicting reports as to the primary target genes regulated by atRA and other differentiation stimuli. Most studies of atRA regulation of the balance between adipocytes vs osteoblasts has been done in cell lines, and has focused on single genes controlling in one stem cell fate, often later during differentiation. The use of cell lines (e.g. 3T3- L1, F442A, C2C12, MC3T3-E1) most likely has contributed to the conflicting conclusions, because cell lines do not faithfully model primary cells, differ from each other, and even cell lines with the same nominal designation often differ as a result of long-term culture. This proposal addresses atRA function in directing MSC fate by proposing study of an in vivo model of atRA insufficiency, which will be accompanied by generating primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts to produce comprehensive mechanistic insight into determining adipocyte vs. osteoblast cell fates. The in vivo model relies on heterozygote ablated Rdh10 (Rdh10+/-) that has a phenotype of increased adiposity and adipocyte proliferation in bone marrow early in life, with decreased calcification of osteoblasts. The Rdh10+/- model (the homozygote is embryonic lethal) provides for consistently attenuated vitamin A function in vivo through reproducibly reduced atRA. This is an innovative model that will provide new insight into atRA function concerning regulating differentiation of adipocytes vs osteoblasts, and new insight into Rdh10 function and atRA biogenesis. Understanding the roles of Rdh10 and atRA in obesity and adipogenesis promises direct human health applications. This expectation is supported by the twenty-six intergenic traits related to body mass index and weight gain that map close to human Rdh10. Aim 1 will determine the phenotype and metabolic consequences of reducing Rdh10 expression and atRA concentrations in vivo (Rdh10+/- mice), focusing on adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. This aim will test the hypothesis that Rdh10 is a major enzyme that controls atRA homeostasis to regulate retinoid function in adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. Aim 2 will determine mechanism(s) that underlie the phenotype of Rdh10+/- mice with respect to cell fate determination. This aim will use two sets of MEF: 1) from Rdh10+/- mice; 2) immortalized MEF with a total knockout of Rdh10 to test the hypothesis that atRA generated by Rdh10 directs maturation of MSC by regulating gene expression very early in cell fate determination, and will identify the responsive genes."

"9370393","PROJECT SUMMARY  The management of gout is suboptimal and complicated by high prevalence of comorbidities, including chronic  kidney disease (CKD); 71% of gout patients in U.S. have CKD stage 2 or higher. A key reason for  suboptimal gout care is lack of knowledge and acceptance for the utility of lowering serum urate (sUA) levels to  < 6 mg/dl (based on the solubility threshold of 6.8 mg/dl), known as treat-to-target (TTT). While a sUA  threshold of < 6 mg/dl is valuable for managing gout, it has not been examined for renal function preservation.  Recently, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funded a 4-year randomized, double-blinded, non-inferiority  ?Stop Gout? (VA CSP594) study with a sUA TTT approach, which will assess the comparative effectiveness of  allopurinol vs. febuxostat. Our proposed study, Protecting Renal functiOn with Urate-lowering Drugs (PROUD),  a mechanistic ancillary study to this innovative trial, will leverage trial data to assess whether achieving target  sUA is valuable for renal function preservation for the first time, with the following two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the efficacy of sUA lowering and allopurinol and febuxostat dose in  preserving renal function in gout patients. We hypothesize that each of the following factors will be  positively associated with renal function preservation as assessed by change in eGFR based on serum  creatinine at 72-weeks (primary outcome) and serum Cystatin C at 48-weeks (secondary outcome): Achieving  a sUA reduction and a target sUA level < 6 mg/dl at 24-weeks (Hypotheses 1a and 1b), baseline CKD Stage 3  (compared to CKD stage 1 or 2; Hypothesis 1c), the final up-titrated allopurinol dose at 21-weeks (Hypothesis  1d), and the final up-titrated febuxostat dose at 18-weeks (Hypothesis 1e). Specific Aim 2 will assess the  mechanisms of renal function preservation in gout. We hypothesize that reduction at 24-weeks in each of  the following will be associated with renal function preservation at 72-weeks: Renin-angiotensin system  activation (plasma renin and aldosterone; Hypothesis 2a), systemic inflammation (IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-?, MCP-1,  PDGF, C-reactive protein; Hypothesis 2b), and oxidative stress level (lipid peroxidation by 8-epi-PGF2a;  protein oxidation by carbonyl formation, 3-nitrotyrosine formation and reduced thiol status; Hypothesis 2c).  PROUD will have high public health impact and will advance the field by addressing unanswered questions  related to renal function preservation with XOI in gout and underlying mechanisms. The University of Alabama  at Birmingham (UAB) and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), two large academic gout and  immunology research centers, are ideally positioned to address the clinical and mechanistic questions posed.  Our collaborative expertise, complemented by the leveraged resources of the proposed NIAMS supported P50  UAB Center of Research Translation (CORT) will be used to execute this novel translational study."
"9351488","ABSTRACT: In Bangladesh, as in other lower- and middle-income countries, the weak research infrastructure reduces the efficiency of research projects that are undertaken, as many Bangladeshi institutions do not have the complete set of skills (technical, statistical, management, methods, or community engagement skills) to undertake a successful research project and disseminate the results. Morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is growing in these countries, and there is growing evidence that country-specific research is needed to identify risk factors that are unique to the context of LMICs. With the resources of this RCRE grant, we would (1) identify institutions that already have expertise in research practice, and develop a formal framework that encourages the sharing of this expertise across institutions, increasing the efficiency of research by supporting a division of labor (2) increase the robustness of the identified existing expertise by research enhancement activities that allow the collaborators at the partner institutions to hone their skills and disseminate the results of their research and (3) use two pilot projects to engage the newly-formulated RCRE protocol, using the expertise of the RCRE?s shared core facilities and enhancing their research capacity. Collaborators at the University of Chicago have a long history of collaboration with institutions in Bangladesh, including a 15-year history of collaborating with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), the only full medical university in Bangladesh. With this local knowledge, the two lead institutions (UC and BSMMU), selected 6 additional regional research institutions to collaborate with. These six additional institutions will make up the shared core facilities of the RCRE, and will implement aspects of a research protocol that are relevant to their expertise. The shared core facilities are National Institute of Cancer Research & Hospital (NICRH), the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), University of Chicago Research Bangladesh (URB), Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), National Institute of Neurological Diseases (NIND), and the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB). In addition Directorate General of Health Services of Government of Bangladesh will also be a partner in this RCRE. Each of these institutions has a proven ability to excel in one of the five areas of research expertise we identified: clinical and diagnostics; data management, statistics, and informatics; biomarkers; population survey and data collection; and community engagement, outreach, and dissemination. After formally establishing this RCRE, we will implement two pilot research projects whose research topics reflect two key areas of NCD research: the establishment of a pathology-based cancer registry in the capital, Dhaka; and the relationship between the microbiome (which varies greatly between populations) and cardiovascular disease. Each of these pilot projects will be undertaken with the collaboration of the RCRE shared core facilities, and supported by workshops, short courses, and colloquium that have been developed to enhance the existing capacity of the RCRE members. This formal network of collaboration will strengthen the capacity of local researchers to investigate the determinants of NCD in local populations, and lead to better informed policies and care."
"9232470","Abstract: Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer, characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and propensity for lethal metastasis. Melanoma is driven by mutational activation of BRAFV600E accompanied by PTEN loss resulting in concurrent activation of BRAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) pathways. Activation of these pathways plays crucial role in melanoma cell proliferation, survival, tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. Agents that target the MAPK signaling pathway, the BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib), and the MEK inhibitor (trametinib) in combination with dabrafenib, have shown remarkable anti- tumor activity and improved the overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. However, most patients still developed resistance and ultimately succumbed to metastatic disease. In the majority of cases, resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors occurs through reactivation of MAPK pathway and activation of the PI3K signaling. This paradigm of chemoresistance with scarce treatment alternatives signals an urgent need to develop novel agents that down-regulate PI3K pathway to achieve durable clinical control of BRAFV600E- mutated melanoma along with BRAF inhibitors. Thus, identification of phytochemicals that can be used in combination with lower doses of existing chemotherapeutic drugs is of high clinical relevance. Plumbagin (5- hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), a naturally occurring naphthoquinone isolated from the plant Plumbago zeylanica L., exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic activities. Consistent with this notion, our preliminary findings supported by this grant application have helped us begin to define the utility of plumbagin for the treatment of melanoma. Our data indicate that plumbagin treatment induces apoptosis, and reduces the proliferation, migration, and invasion of BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma cells. Plumbagin's effects resulted from decreased expression of PI3K and reduced phosphorylation of AKT. In this application, we propose to capitalize on our novel findings to investigate the effects of plumbagin (that targets PI3K/AKT) in combination with vemurafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) on the proliferation, tumorigenesis and metastasis of BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma cells. We hypothesize that the treatment of BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma cells with plumbagin could offer a therapeutic advantage by inhibiting PI3K/AKT in combination with vemurafenib over an individual agent. We propose a two-fold approach to test this hypothesis. First, we will investigate the effects of plumbagin and vemurafenib alone and in combination on proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of BRAFV600E- mutated melanoma cells in vitro and in three-dimensional human melanoma skin eqivalents. Second, we will investigate the effects of plumbagin and vemurafenib alone and in combination on tumor growth, metastasis and survival by employing a genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma. Together, these studies will likely provide novel treatment options for this life threatening skin cancer."
"9386898","Center for Research on the Respiratory Microbiota of African Children (ReMAC) Research Project 2: The nasopharyngeal microbiota of African children and lower respiratory tract infection Specific aims The nasopharynx (NP) is the reservoir for many key bacterial pathogens responsible for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children, is the portal of entry for respiratory viruses and also harbors potentially pathogenic fungi. Data from our groups and others have demonstrated patterns of dysbiosis that may be associated with the development of respiratory tract infections in children, however this has not been studied comprehensively, and accounting for all components of the microbiota. There is also evidence that the bacterial microbiota may modulate the severity of viral LRTI. We therefore propose to study bacterial, viral and fungal components of the NP microbiota in order to determine whether the composition of the NP microbiota in the period before LRTI and at the time of LRTI is different between children who developed vs. did not develop LRTI and different between children who developed severe LRTI vs. non-severe LRTI. We also wish to explore whether the composition of the NP microbiota after LRTI may be associated with recurrent LRTI and with the presence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in the NP. We will utilize existing NP specimens and metadata from a frequently sampled cohort in South Africa, with a very high incidence of LRTI, as well as specimens from cross-sectional case control studies of LRTI in The Gambia and Malawi. We will use amplicon sequencing to define the bacterial and fungal components of the microbiota, targeted nucleic acid amplification testing for the viral component, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to complement, validate and extend our findings and identify novel targets. We will do selective culture to identify antimicrobial resistant bacteria in NP specimens. We will apply statistical models such as Bayesian state space models and Dirichlet multinomial count models to compare the mixture of microorganisms and shift over time in each of the identified comparison groups. Predictor importance will be evaluated by using a variety of machine learning models. An improved understanding of the association of the NP microbiota with LRTI may lead to the development of new tools for diagnosis or risk prediction. This could include tools to predict which children are at high risk of LRTI, identify children at risk of progression to severe LRTI and children at risk of recurrent LRTI. In addition, understanding the possible role of the NP in the pathogenesis of LRTI or recurrent LRTI may lead to the identification of novel strategies to prevent LRTI, progression to severe LRTI or recurrent LRTI. These could include targeted probiotic therapy, novel vaccines or vaccine strategies and new therapeutics to treat LRTI."
"9362580","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed study expands the body of knowledge regarding methods to address the needs of family care- givers (FCGs) transitioning from hospital-based palliative care to homes in rural, medically-underserved areas. Caregiving for individuals with life-limiting illnesses frequently causes caregiver burden, depression, decreased coping skills and quality of life. Often, FCGs are confronted by challenges such as inadequate caregiving knowledge and skills, limited support, demanding family circumstances, and limited time for themselves. Alt- hough FCGs often have substantial personal health needs equal to or greater than the patients' needs, the FCGs' needs have received limited attention. It is, therefore, critically important that interventions be explored that link proven strategies in an approach to implementing transitional palliative care (TPC) in a way that in- creases communication and support to FCGs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel, nurse-led, technology-enhanced, theory-based care model of transitional palliative care (TPC) for FCGs living in rural, medically underserved areas. A randomized controlled clinical trial design will be used to address the following specific aims: (1) Evaluate the effect of technology- enhanced TPC for FCGs on caregiving preparedness (Preparedness for Caregiving Scale), communication with clinicians (Communication with Physicians Scale), and satisfaction with care (PACIC); (2) Evaluate the effect of technology-enhanced TPC for FCGs' quality of life (Caregiver Quality of Life Scale-Cancer), burden (Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale-Revised), coping skills (Post-Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale), and de- pression (CESD-10); and (3) Examine the effect of technology-enhanced TPC for FCGs on healthcare costs. An intensive 8 week transitional care intervention, TPC for FCGs focuses on the needs of FCGs of palliative care patients. In this study, 240 FCGs will be randomized to either the experimental or usual care control groups. The intervention includes in-hospital and in-home components. Because the FCGs and care recipients live in rural settings, the in-home component will be conducted using virtual visits. Outcomes will be evaluated at 2 weeks and 8 weeks from baseline (Aims 1 & 2) using a response-feature analysis as our primary approach to analyzing these repeated measures data. Both descriptive and multivariable-adjusted measures of costs for 6 months post-enrollment from a societal perspective will be analyzed (Aim 3). This study, is: (1) aligned with NINR's strategic goal to develop and test strategies to minimize the physical and psychological burdens on FCGs' health, particularly as the care recipients near the end of their life; (2) innova- tive because it represents a substantive departure from current transitional care approaches that are limited to in-person interactions in both the hospital and home; and (3) significant because it addresses the rapidly in- creasing need for TPC services to medically underserved rural areas."

The  program has 27 NCI projects, a lung cancer SPORE, as well as 12 multi-investigator awards. ET Program  clinical investigators represent key oncology disciplines, including medical, surgical, pediatrics, and radiation  oncology; radiology; and pathology. Investigators in the ET Program are currently supported by over $24.7  million in peer-reviewed funding (total costs) with $7.5 million from the NCI, $4 million from other NIH sources,  and $7.3 million from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT)  The ET Program is designed to provide an organized, science-based conduit for translating SCC discoveries  from the scientific programs to the clinic, and to help establish appropriate preclinical models and data to  facilitate clinical translation. Likewise, clinical data are then used to form new hypotheses tested by our strong  basic science foundation throughout the SCC. The program themes focus on drug (Themes 1,2) and  biomarker (Themes 3,4) discovery to identify optimal populations for these new treatments.   Theme 1: Molecular Therapeutic Sensitizers   Theme 2: Tumor Microenvironment and Protein Therapy   Theme 3: Imaging and Drug Delivery   Theme 4: Cancer Vulnerabilities  The Co-Leaders of the ET Program work together to foster and develop themes, goals, membership, and new  collaborations in specific research areas for clinical translation. This process heavily engages SCC disease  DOTs (disease oriented teams) to focus specific therapeutics on select cancers, as evidenced by mechanistic-  based research where target validation is assessed using pharmacodynamic biomarkers. These activities, in  turn, stimulate intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations. The ET Program averages over 100 publications  per year, and since 2009 the level of collaborative publications has remained quite high, with 35% intra-  programmatic, 34% inter-programmatic and 28% inter-institutional with authors in other NCI-designated cancer  centers."
"9413735","Musculoskeletal disorders are common and result in significant disability and health care costs.  Advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders requires a robust clinical research  infrastructure and improved classification of the various disorders. The latter is critical to precision or  personalized medicine approaches as many musculoskeletal disorders have common clinical presentations of  pain and impaired physical function despite diverse pathophysiology. Furthermore, research to date often  focuses on bone or muscle and not how they interact. The overarching theme of the Indiana Core Center for  Clinical Research (ICCCR) is to enhance clinical research in musculoskeletal disorders and to understand the  muscle-bone connection by better defining, or phenotyping, this broad class of disorders in order to advance  clinical research. The ICCCR will leverage campus resources of our CTSA that includes Indiana and Purdue  Universities, our statewide healthcare system IU Health, the Regenstrief Institute's statewide electronic health  record system, and the Precision Health Initiative to enhance clinical research. The ICCCR will work with  Thematic Teams of multi-disciplinary investigators to create innovative ways to think about musculoskeletal  disorder phenotypes. The ICCCR will support individuals to connect investigators and Thematic Teams to the  methodologic and resource cores thereby facilitating access to and help in conducting research that 1) utilizes  our vast network of electronic health records, omics, and bioinformatics group to create computable, genetic  and molecular phenotypes, 2) develops standardized physical function and imaging modalities to develop  functional and morphologic phenotypes, and 3) expands the Indiana Biobank's musculoskeletal tissue and  blood resources. The ICCCR will work with community and industry partners to facilitate recruitment and  technology transfer and provide pilot funding to support new research. In the Methodologic Core, the ICCCR  will train, facilitate and support investigators to expand access to biostatical support and project  review, enhance clinical research and patient health by leveraging large databases to define and  validate computable phenotypes, and accelerate the human to bench and back cycle of  musculoskeletal discovery by assisting investigators in state of the art evaluation of musculoskeletal  biospecimens. These new and innovative initiatives under the ICCCR will link our musculoskeletal  researchers of Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Research to state of the art resources to identify novel  targets for diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. We will challenge the traditional approach of  bench to bedside research to instead focus on patient phenotype to bench and back research. This will  improve the definition and diagnosis of the many musculoskeletal disorders to diseases that have common  pathogenesis and clinical presentations, facilitating personalized medicine by focusing the right treatment for  each patient."

"9431389","ABSTRACT Mass spectrometry (MS) based metabolomics is an important tool in biological and clinical sciences; however, unambiguous annotation and/or identification of detected compounds are major challenges. Errors in annotation are perpetuated through differential and pathway analysis, rendering interpretation difficult and inaccurate. Confident annotations and validated identifications can be obtained through additional experimentation, including comparison to authentic standards. However, this is expensive, time-consuming, and is generally performed after pathway and differential analysis have occurred. We propose a metabolite annotation algorithm that will result in improved annotation by integrating gene and pathway information. We expect to improve metabolite annotation, which will lead to better interpretation of metabolomics data. The goal is to develop a powerful tool that can aid biomedical researchers and bioinformaticians in metabolite annotation; the result will be improved utilization of datasets and more accurate interpretation in the context of disease. Briefly, gene expression will be used to determine which proteins are likely to be present in KEGG pathways. Their proximity to the metabolite of interest in the pathway is used to determine the likelihood of the metabolite?s presence. To develop the algorithm, we will use targeted data from the COPDGene cohort that not only contains MS data for which we want to improve annotation, but also tandem MS data using purchased standards. The latter will be used to evaluate different scoring schemes. We will validate the algorithm on untargeted data from a COPDGene cohort that has a small overlap with the targeted cohort. We expect to provide a tool for biomedical researchers and bioinformaticians that improves their ability to annotate and interpret their MS data; this will reduce resources needed to follow up on annotated metabolites. The gene expression data used here is publicly available. The metabolomics data will be available at the Metabolomics Workbench. Ultimately, we expect that this tool can be applied to any studies where combined genomics and metabolomics data is available."

"9561366","Sexual violence (SV) experienced by women on college campuses is a serious public health problem that has garnered a national response. Campus climate surveys show that approximately one in five college women experience sexual violence. Federal regulations now mandate implementation of educational prevention programs for new students of institutions of higher education (IHEs). Best practices for sexual violence prevention involve the design of programs that target both men for prevention and women for risk reduction. This Fast-Track STTR proposal integrates both behavioral science and emerging technologies in a genderspecific web-based program targeting female college students. RealConsent is designed to reduce young women?s risk for sexual assault by a) increasing young women?s awareness of the risks of alcohol use; b) enhancing the skills necessary for engaging in alcohol-related protective behaviors; c) raising awareness of dating-related risk factors for victimization; d) teaching effective resistance strategies; and e). RealConsent will incorporate high-level production quality, educational entertainment, didactic methods, and interactive problembased learning via a web portal. Our long-term goal is to disseminate the program to IHEs nation-wide and contribute to a significant reduction in sexual violence incidence and associated morbidity. The specific aims for Phase I of this project are: Aim 1: Develop one, 30-minute alcohol awareness and risk reduction web-based module specific to female college students. This module will represent one module of a more comprehensive, four-module web-based program. Aim 2: Assess the acceptability and feasibility of the web-based alcohol risk reduction module to increase alcohol protective behaviors among female college students. Focus groups and a pilot study with female college students will test the module for acceptability and feasibility. Once milestones for Phase I are achieved, Phase II will begin and aims are to: Aim 1: Develop modules two-four of the webbased program, the web portal for delivery of the program and the administrator dashboard. Aim 2: Determine efficacy of RealConsent in reducing incidence of sexual assault victimization. A randomized controlled trial implemented among a sample of 750 female college students attending three diverse, southeastern universities will test the program for its efficacy: n=375 women will be randomly assigned to RealConsent and n=375 will be assigned to an attention-placebo comparison program. Assessments will occur online at baseline, prior to randomization, and at 6-month post-intervention follow-up. We will then develop final versions of the interactive web-based program for marketability to IHEs."
"9442625","ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this research is to understand how non-muscle myosin II contractility is regulated in the context of cell migration and adhesion. Defects to non-muscle myosin II contractility can lead to a number of human diseases including cardiomyopathy, renal disease, deafness, and cranial-facial disorders. Recently, mutations to SPECC1L has been identified in patients with a spectrum of cranial-facial disorders. A population of cells, known as cranial neural crest cells appear to be the most severely affected by mutations to SPECC1L. Critically, it is this population of cells that eventually forms the facial and jaw structures during embryonic development. While it has been hypothesized that SPECC1L is associated with both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, data generated in my lab as well as evidence gathered from the literature, suggest a role for this protein in the regulation of non-muscle myosin II and cellular adhesion. Using a closely related Drosophila ortholog, Split Discs, we will interrogate the relationship between SPECC1L and its family members and non-muscle myosin II. Through a structure-function analysis we will determine how Split Discs is associating with non-muscle myosin II, and through high-resolution total internal reflection microscopy analyze how Split Discs regulates the formation of non-muscle myosin II filaments used during cellular contractility. We then will use several Drosophila cell lines to examine how Split Discs, through its regulation of non-muscle myosin II contractility, can regulate the formation, dynamics, and force generation cell produce through cell-matrix adhesions. Finally, we will test how Split Discs regulates cell- cell adhesion, a critical component to cranial neural crest cells as they migration by collective cell migration, meaning they maintain cell-cell adhesions as they migrate. Will use both and in vitro tissue-culture based model and an in vivo model of collective cell migration and migration to test our hypothesis. Our studies of the relationship between Split Discs and non-muscle myosin II will not only allow us to glean valuable information about how non-muscle myosin II functions during cell migration, and adhesion, but will also give us critical insight to the pathologies of craniofacial disorders."
"9359987","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The salamander has the greatest regenerative ability of any limbed vertebrate, as salamanders can regenerate entire limbs, organs, and central nervous system structures after amputation or injury. The study of these remarkable feats of regeneration may guide human regenerative medicine, and the tools for this study are rapidly improving. Only recently have high-throughput sequencing techniques allowed scientists to begin to identify large numbers of genes that are highly enriched in regenerating tissues. Genome editing techniques now make it possible to investigate the function of these enriched genes in the salamander. I find that the CRISPR/Cas system of targeted mutagenesis can be easily applied to the Ambystoma mexicanum salamander, or the axolotl, to create individual animals with targeted loss-of-function of specific genes. I propose to use a novel approach to assess the contribution of specific genes to limb regeneration in the axolotl. I find that I can us a genome editing approach to simultaneously label individual populations of cells and alter the function of targeted genes. These two features of gene editing can accelerate the characterization of genes during limb regeneration in the axolotl. By combining gene editing with high-throughput sequencing, I propose to address three topics. I will determine whether a small set of cells give rise to all the structures of a regenerated limb, whether limb regeneration requires existing stores of stem cells, and whether uncharacterized genes are required for regeneration. This project may speed the translation of basic research into the biology of an exotic animal into therapeutics to improve healing in humans."

"9545352","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in tumor-bearing hosts is an important mechanism of suppression of T and NK cell responses and a major obstacle to immunotherapy. MDSC inhibitory activity has been attributed to several pathways, including the depletion of the amino acids arginine and cysteine; the release of reactive oxygen species, peroxynitrites, and prostaglandin E2; and the induction of regulatory T cells. Unfortunately, the understanding of the immune-inhibitory mechanisms induced by MDSC has not yet been translated into successful therapies to globally block MDSC function in cancer. We postulate that the identification and inhibition of the central mediators of MDSC-immune regulatory activity in tumors will overcome T cell suppression and increase the efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapies. In this proposal, we aim to determine the role of the C/EBP homologous stress-related protein (Chop), a common stress sensor usually associated with the induction of cellular apoptosis, as a master regulator of the immune suppressive activity of MDSC. We hypothesize that the induction of Chop in MDSC by multiple stress-related factors, globally drives the ability of MDSC to inhibit T cell responses and modulates MDSC turnover/survival homeostasis. Therefore, therapeutic inhibition of Chop or its upstream mediators in tumors will block MDSC function, restore protective anti-tumor effector T cell responses, and increase the efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapies. This hypothesis is based upon our extensive preliminary findings suggesting the central role of Chop on MDSC activity. We will test our hypothesis and achieve the objectives of this study through the following Specific Aims: (1) To determine the mechanisms by which the expression of Chop in the stroma regulates the immune suppression activity and the accumulation of MDSC in tumors. (2) To determine the mechanisms that induce Chop expression in tumor-infiltrating MDSC. (3) To test the prediction that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of Chop will block MDSC function and increase the efficacy of T cell-based immunotherapies in cancer. Completion of the proposed study will describe for the first time how multiple stress factors in tumors drive global MDSC activity through a unique pathway. In addition, the results will help characterize and develop a novel therapeutic approach, which carries the potential to block the global immune inhibitory functions of MDSC and to restore protective T cell immunity in cancer. Moreover, the methodology established in this proposal could be applied into other diseases where MDSC are major mediators of T cell suppression."
"9361021","Clear cell type renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is the most common and aggressive form of kidney cancer, and is among the most resistant of solid tumors to therapy. CCRCC is typically initiated by inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, resulting in the constitutive activation of the hypoxia inducible factors, HIF-1? and HIF-2?. CCRCC progression is uniquely driven by HIF-2?, whereas HIF-1? plays a tumor suppressor role. Thus, HIF-2? is an attractive therapeutic target for CCRCC. Through a high throughput screening campaign, we have identified a series of compounds that selectively decrease HIF-2? protein and activity without affecting HIF-1?. We show that these compounds act by enhancing the binding of iron regulatory protein (IRP)-1 to the iron-responsive element (IRE) within the 5' untranslated region of HIF-2? mRNA, which inhibits HIF-2? translation. Using an unbiased global proteomic screen, we confirm Iron-sulfur Cluster Assembly 2 (ISCA2) as the molecular target of these compounds. ISCA2 regulates the incorporation of the iron-sulfur cluster into IRP-1, which modulates its IRE-binding activity. ISCA2 is non-transcriptionally induced by hypoxia, and is a putative pVHL target, suggesting that ISCA2 may play a hypoxia- or CCRCC- specific role. We observe that both ISCA2 and cellular iron are upregulated in CCRCC compared to paired normal kidney, and are significantly correlated. Inhibition of ISCA2 selectively decreases HIF-2? protein without affecting HIF-1?, and depletes cellular iron independently of HIF-2?. Significantly, ISCA2 inhibition by small molecules inhibits CCRCC xenograft growth, and decreases intra-tumoral HIF-2? protein. Thus, our hypothesis is that ?ISCA2 plays a central role in promoting the elevation of HIF-2? and cellular iron that drive CCRCC progression. Hence, the targeting of ISCA2 provides a novel strategy for the specific inhibition of HIF- 2? and depletion of cellular iron for the treatment of CCRCC?. Our first aim is to identify the mechanisms mediating ISCA2 induction in hypoxia; and to characterize its role in the regulation of HIF-2? and iron metabolism in CCRCC. Our second aim is to investigate the impact of ISCA2 modulation on CCRCC progression using in vitro and in vivo models, and to determine its physiological relevance using clinical samples of human CCRCC (samples from 600 patients obtained). Our third aim is to investigate the therapeutic impact of ISCA2 inhibition on HIF-2? and cytoplasmic iron, and to explore its use for the treatment of CCRCC. The overall goal of our studies is to identify the mechanisms by which ISCA2, HIF-2? and the deregulation of iron metabolism contribute to CRCC progression; and to determine whether ISCA2 inhibition will yield increased therapeutic benefit for patients with CCRCC."
"9341740","ABSTRACT Nigeria is the most populous country in sub Saharan Africa and provides the largest telecommunication market in Africa, with over 100 million phone lines and over 85% of urban dwellers having at least one personal phone. These phone lines are widely deployed for making financial transactions, browsing the internet and recording daily activities. There remains, however, a huge gap in harnessing this technology for improving health care of the population. With an estimated annual delivery of over 150, 000 newborn babies with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), Nigeria is home to the largest number of children affected by this condition, globally. In this application, we propose the use of mobile electronic platforms to improve diagnosis and tracking of children with SCD at a location with the highest disease burden in the country. From our established platform for surveillance for serious bacterial infections in young children, we have confirmed the contribution of SCD to morbidity and mortality at this location. Using this platform we will evaluate a new point-of-care diagnostic with digital transmission of results to a central database and cellphones for subject tracking to improve the turnaround time for diagnosis, specialist clinic registration and subject tracking with the ultimate goal of providing a platform that can be scaled up for a robust national surveillance program for SCD care."
"9470079","Project Summary/Abstract This mixed methods study aims to assess whether peer-support reduces disparities in mental health service utilization and social outcomes among transitional age youth (TAY) age 16-24 with severe mental illness (SMI). TAY with SMI face extraordinary challenges in their transition to adulthood and exhibit lower levels of educational attainment, and higher rates of unemployment, poverty, unplanned pregnancy, substance use, homelessness, and justice system involvement than TAY without SMI. These disparities are exacerbated among minority TAY. Therefore, there is a great need for evidence-based, culturally tailored interventions that effectively link TAY to resources that can improve their mental health and social outcomes. The 2004 California Mental Health Services Act funded hundreds of new TAY-specific programs; while TAY peer support services are now pervasive in mental health programs, evidence regarding their effectiveness for TAY with SMI is largely lacking. Therefore, this study aims to (1) Estimate quantitatively whether the use of peer support reduces racial / ethnic disparities in mental health services and social outcomes among TAY living with SMI; (2) Identify quantitatively which types or combinations of peer supports are most effective at improving mental health services and social outcomes and reducing racial / ethnic disparities among TAY; (3) Estimate the additional mental health service costs or cost savings associated with providing peer support services to TAY; (4) Qualitatively elucidate TAY clients? and peer providers? perceptions of how TAY peer support relates to mental health services and social outcomes disparities; and (5) Qualitatively characterize barriers and facilitators to the use of TAY peer support by TAY program managers and county administrators. To meet these aims, we will survey TAY programs (N=140), analyze five years of administrative data to assess costs or cost-savings associated with using peer support services (N=8,800, Aims 1-3) and conduct small group interviews with TAY peer providers (n=30-40), focus groups with TAY clients (n=60-80), and individual interviews with as TAY program managers (n=20) and county administrators (n=6-10) (Aims 4 and 5). This study leverages a major system redesign in California?s mental health system and aims to rigorously study a large-scale implementation of TAY peer support services. Findings will help providers and policy-makers make informed decisions about the effectiveness of peer support in reducing disparities among minority TAY living with SMI and enable us to make recommendations on potential best-practices in the use of TAY peer supports."
"9310821","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to muscular atrophy, paralysis and death in 3-5 years from the onset of symptoms. The only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of ALS, Riluzole, has only moderate effects, prolonging survival by three months on average. Therefore, new strategies are urgently needed to develop drugs that can significantly  improve  survival  and quality of life of ALS patients. Compelling evidence indicates that the misfolding of copper and zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) into toxic conformation underlies the pathogenesis of about 20% of familiar ALS and maybe, also some sporadic ALS. Therefore, stabilization of SOD1 structure and restoration of its native conformation should be a desirable approach to cure SOD1-related ALS. Small molecule chemical chaperones have been approved by FDA for treating other diseases caused by misfolded proteins, such as cystic fibrosis and transthyretin amyloidoses. However, no such chemical chaperone has been reported for refolding of misfolded SOD1, even at experimental stage.  In this proposal, we will develop a high-content screening (HCS) approach to identify small molecules that promote refolding of SOD1 mutants to their wild type (wt) conformation. Successful development of such a screening strategy is strongly supported by our preliminary studies. We have identified a peptide sequence that is normally concealed in native wt SOD1 but exposed in ALS-linked SOD1 mutants and a misfolded form of wt SOD1. Importantly the exposed peptide sequence resembles nuclear export signal (NES) and indeed, has nuclear export activity. Consequently, misfolded wt SOD1 and SOD1 mutants are cleared from the nucleus due to the NES-like peptide(NLP)-mediated nuclear export, while native wt SOD1 is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We propose an imaging-based assay to identify small molecules that restore nuclear localization of SOD1 mutants as an indicator of refolding to native wt SOD1 conformation. We have generated an antibody against NLP that specifically recognizes SOD1 mutants and misfolded wt SOD1, but not native wt SOD1 in cells. Accordingly, the NLP antibody will be used to distinguish the misfolded conformation from the native form of SOD1, and thereby can validate the folding status of SOD1 mutants after compound treatment. These preliminary studies lead us to pursue three specific aims: 1) develop a cell-based biplex platform for primary and counterscreens to identify small molecule chaperones that refold mutant SOD1 to its native wt conformation, 2) perform an automated pilot screening of NCGC Pharmaceutical Collection compound library to identify mutant SOD1 refolding chaperones, and 3) hit validation and characterization. Upon completion, the proposed research will establish the first HCS assay and hit validation pipeline for chemical chaperones that refold SOD1. Future studies will include large-scale screen in collaboration with Dr.  Mark Henderson at NCATS. Furthermore, candidate chaperones identified in this study will undergo preclinical assessment and optimization in collaboration with experts in related fields, with the ultimate goal being a clinically relevant class of drugs to treat SOD1-linked ALS through direct correction of SOD1 misfolding."
"9565795","Summary Pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy, such as that caused by chronic hypertension, is a key risk factor for heart failure. Accumulating evidence from studies in patients and animal models suggests that cardiac hypertrophy induced by the chronic pressure overload is not a compensatory but rather is a maladaptive process. Thus, modulation of pathological myocardial hypertrophy is increasingly recognized as a potentially promising approach in the prevention of development of heart failure. Despite intensive research efforts over several decades, the molecular mechanisms of hypertrophic heart failure are not fully understood. Our recent study found that the valosin-containing protein (VCP), a protein which is previously uncharacterized in the heart, represents a mediator of cardioprotection that is directly relevant to the condition of cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction induced by hypertension in patients. The originality of this proposal is based on our preliminary findings that VCP expression is significantly down-regulated in the pressure overloaded hearts in variant animal models. We also found that cardiac specific overexpression of VCP in a transgenic mouse significantly attenuates the pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, while impaired VCP accelerates cardiac dysfunction under pressure overload and also hastens age related cardiomyopathy. We also found that VCP presents a dual regulatory effect on the signaling of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the heart. As supported by the Preliminary Data, our overall hypothesis is that VCP is an essential mediator of cardioprotection against pressure-overload induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction which is mediated by a mechanism of regulating growth and survival of cardiomyocytes via modulating mTOR signaling. Thus, in this proposal, we will elucidate further the physiological relevance and the underlying mechanisms of VCP in the heart at baseline and under pressure overload through two Specific Aims. Our first Aim is to determine the physiological relevance of VCP on the cardiac growth and function during aging and under pressure overload. We will test our hypothesis that an insufficiency of VCP is responsible for the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction during aging and under pressure overload of heart, and an overexpression VCP will provide protection against the cardiac deterioration under these conditions. Our second Aim is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cardiac protection conferred by VCP. We will test our hypothesis that VCP acts as a unique dual regulator for mTOR complexes by selectively activating the survival complex mTORC2 but inhibiting the growth-promoting complex mTORC1 under the pathological stress. We also hypothesize that this selective effect of VCP depends on its N-terminal regulatory domain. Based on our extensive preliminary data and previous publications, we strongly believe that our proposed studies using the comprehensive in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro approaches will elucidate the specific mechanisms involved in the cardiac protection by VCP under pressure overload which will provide a new strategy for preventing and treating the heart failure. ."
"9409488","Mutations in the ras family of genes were first identified in human cancer over 30 years ago. Such mutations may result in the constitutive activation of one or more of three major Ras protein isoforms, including H-Ras, NRas, or K-Ras, that mediate important signaling pathways leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development. Activating mutations of ras genes occur de novo in approximately one-third of all human cancers and are especially prevalent in colorectal, lung, and pancreatic tumors. Mutations in ras also arise in tumors that become resistant to chemotherapy and/or radiation. Currently there are no available drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that can selectively suppress the growth of tumors driven by activated Ras. Employing a cell-based phenotypic screen, ADT Pharmaceuticals Inc. has discovered a novel compound series that potently and selectively inhibits tumor cells harboring activated Ras. Following extensive chemical optimization, a preclinical development candidate, DC070-547, was identified that shows low nanomolar growth inhibitory IC50 values in tumor cells harboring activated Ras, while tumor cells lacking activated Ras, and cells derived from normal tissues, are insensitive. Data suggest that the drug interacts with Ras to disrupt Ras-Raf interactions and suppress downstream signaling of both the Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. DC070-547 shows strong in vivo antitumor activity in a mouse xenograft model following i.p. administration with no discernible toxicity and attractive drug-like properties feasible for oral delivery. Here we propose to develop an oral formulation to enable further preclinical development and will work closely with Catalent, Inc., a company with extensive formulation expertise. Aim 1 will synthesize DC070-547 in bulk and extensively characterize the physiochemical properties of the compound in pre-formulation studies. Aim 2 will develop at least 4 unique formulations of DC070-547 and Aim 3 will determine the in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics of the formulations and will select a final dose to be evaluated for tolerability in mice. We anticipate a clinical development candidate in an optimal formulation for oral delivery will emerge from this project that will be advanced to a Phase II SBIR application involving further preclinical development to optimize dose and schedule, GMP scale-up synthesis, and GLP toxicity assessment to support an IND application for human clinical trials in patients with Ras-driven cancers."
"9352325","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pittsburgh Clinical Center (PCC) is a clinical-translational program at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC designed to conduct studies on recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) and factors that increase the risk of fibrosis, pain, and pancreatogenic diabetes (T3cDM) in children and adults, and risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in adults with CP and/or DM. Multi-disciplinary teams at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC are organized to participate in comprehensive clinical, epidemiological and biological characterization of patients with pancreatic disorders and to define the pathophysiology of RAP & CP and their sequela. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. To develop integrated clinical center core processes to facilitate data and biosample management, to maximize communication and to evaluate of new technologies. Aim 2. To establish a model longitudinal research cohort of patients during evolution of definite CP. Aim 3. To generate and test a framework to analyze risk factors affecting the progression of RAP, probable CP and definite CP, and clinically useful biomarkers to monitor disease state and endpoints. Our existing and well-established, efficient and effective clinical infrastructure for patient accrual, sample processing, disease progression assessment, data management and analysis will support the program. The rich clinical volume, expert physician phenotypers in all critical areas, established leadership in epidemiology, genetics, physiology, cell biology, imaging, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and all relevant disease subtypes, plus administrative authority in clinical and research areas for both the adult and children ensure continued success. The history of strong collaborations and working relationships of the PCC faculty with many outstanding programs at other universities will also provide momentum to the national consortium."
"9401923","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory disorders, estimated to affect 1 in 13 people in the U.S. Although advances in treatment have significantly improved disease management, poorly controlled asthma is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current strategy to improve asthma control focuses on reducing inflammation. GATA3, a transcriptional activator, is involved in T lymphocyte differentiation and signaling, particularly in the Th2 subtype, and regulates the expression of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL- 13, which play major roles in the inflammation responsible for asthma. Accordingly, knock down of GATA3 expression is a promising strategy for treating asthmatic patients with the Th2 endotype. A range of antisense and RNAi technologies have been tested, and among these approaches, DNA enzymes (Dzs) have shown the greatest promise in animal models and Phase 1 clinical trials. Dzs are canonical DNA oligonucleotides that catalytically degrade a specific complementary RNA sequence. Despite the success of soluble Dzs as a therapeutic intervention, delivering highly charged oligonucleotides across the plasma membrane, and preventing nuclease degradation are major challenges. To address these problems, we propose developing GATA3 DNAzyme nanoparticle conjugates that elucidate the stability and delivery issues in the lung. Preliminary evidence shows that conjugating ~100 Dzs to a 14-nm gold particle forms a complex (DzNP) that improves airway function in mouse models of asthma. Importantly, DzNPs use one order of magnitude lower Dz dose compared to their soluble counterparts. A fundamental question pertains to how DzNPs mediate improved efficacy. The central hypothesis is that DzNPs differentially target resident cell types that overexpress class A scavenger receptors, which are primary contributors to the Th2 asthma subtype. To test this hypothesis, I propose the following specific aims: Aim 1 will measure scavenger receptor A expression levels, DzNP uptake, and GATA3 knockdown efficiency in lung cell lines. The goal is understanding how DzNP treatment differs from that of Dzs and whether the cell targets mediate improved efficacy. Aim 2 will determine whether the DzNP acts as a delivery vehicle for Dz payloads, or whether the DzNP construct is the functional agent mediating GATA3 regulation. This will be achieved by employing fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) microscopy probes that report the molecular environment of the Dz molecule. The trainee will master a wide range of engineering and biological techniques, including nanoparticle design, characterization, development and microscopy. The proposed research will provide insight into a novel method of gene regulation using a synthetic biomaterial. This research will provide a foundation for future development of nanoparticle-based therapeutic strategies for numerous diseases."
"9431875","Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field."
"9552948","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cholestatic liver diseases are among the most important liver disorders that occur in infants and children, leading to devastating morbidity and accounting for over 70% of liver transplants performed during childhood, thus posing a major public health burden. Although major advances in genetics of these disorders have been made over the past decade, few therapeutic options are available. Investigation of these disorders promises to advance scientific knowledge about hepatobiliary development, hepatocyte transporters, cholangiocyte biology, genetic regulatory networks, the neonatal immune response and mechanisms of injury, as well as the discovery of biomarkers of disease and testing of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. With the advent of next generation sequencing and genomics/epigenomics, disease modeling mathematical paradigms and a pipeline of new therapies, the potential translational impact of research in these disorders has never been greater. The 8 cholestatic disorders of the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN) have been studied in multi-centered research consortia at our Center for the past 11 years, during the last 5 years within ChiLDReN. Members of our Clinical Center at the University of Colorado Denver and Children's Hospital Colorado have played major leadership roles as the Chair of the Steering Committee of ChiLDReN and the Chair for the CFLD studies. The objectives of this grant application are for our site to be chosen as an active contributing Clinical Center in ChiLDReN; to continue to enroll new study subjects, follow current study subjects and retain subjects and fully implement, complete, analyze and publish all of the ChiLDReN study protocols; to be an active participant in the development of all new investigations, protocols and clinical trials initiated by the Network; to develop and propose new clinical and translational studies and ancillary studies that will utilize existing research subjecs, data and biospecimens, as illustrated by our proposed Scientific Research Plan; to oversee the CFLD studies and the CFLD network within ChiLDReN; to maintain leadership roles and some of the Administrative Functions of ChiLDReN and the CFLD network; and to continue to provide PFIC/BRIC Genotyping and Respiratory Chain Analysis expertise and services to the Network. Our Scientific Research Plan will elucidate the role of regulatory T-cells in human biliary atresia (BA), and determine if there are autoimmunity-associated SNPs in the gene FOXP3 present in BA and if these are related to the severity of BA. In these ways, our Clinical Center will enhance the ChiLDReN goals of promoting clinical and translational research in pediatric cholestatic liver diseases, focusing upon elucidating the pathogenesis and natural history and developing and testing novel therapeutics and clinical management strategies. Advances made by ChiLDReN should improve our understanding and clinical care of these important diseases and help to relieve an important public health burden."
"9440045","PROJECT SUMMARY Guatemala is a lower middle income country struggling with the ?double-burden? of disease (malnutrition and obesity coexisting). It has the second highest prevalence of childhood stunting in the world (49%) and a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, particularly among women (49%). This is concerning because obesity is a risk factor for numerous health problems, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and at least thirteen different types of cancers. Consumption of sugary drinks is strongly associated with obesity and related health problems. In Guatemala, sales of sugary drinks have increased 25% in the last decade (101.1 liters per capita) and Guatemala has one of the highest per capita intakes of sugary beverages worldwide (mean 2.69 servings per day, higher than Mexico (2.40) and the United States (1.89)). The World Health Organization, has identified research on global strategies to reduce sugary drink intake as a key need. Food labeling has become a popular policy approach to address high levels of sugary drink intake. Some countries are interested in placing health warning labels on sugary drinks, but there are no real-world studies testing the effects of such labels. The first aim of the proposed research is to test the effect of repeated exposure to warning labels on mean fluid ounces of sugary drinks purchased by adolescents in Guatemala. This study will examine how repeated exposure to sugary drink warning labels influences 1500 adolescents' purchases at school stores over time. We will enroll six schools in the study (three private and three public). Each pair of matched private/public schools will be randomized to 1 of 3 labeling conditions: 1) kilocalorie (kcal) label (control); 2) text warning labels; or 3) graphic warning labels displaying amounts of sugar. In this six-week study, we will collect sales data during two weeks without labels, two weeks when labels are displayed, and two weeks after labels have been removed. We will also conduct surveys with 1500 students. Our hypotheses are: 1) graphic warning labels will be most effective at decreasing volume of sugary drinks purchased; 2) text warning labels will be less effective than graphic, but more effective than calorie labels; and 3) sales of sugary drinks will decline after label removal, but will remain lower than baseline levels. The second aim of the proposed research is to systematically assess non-communicable disease (NCD) research capacity at the Cancer Institute in Guatemala (INCAN). We will conduct a formal assessment of NCD research capacity at INCAN using an established hierarchy of nine research capacity needs. Finally, our third aim is to catalyze NCD research capacity building in Guatemala by 1) working with faculty, trainees, and fellows on the proposed empirical research; and 2) offering a short course on NCD research for INCAN trainees and researchers. Our long-term goal is to build research capacity for studies that can evaluate policy interventions like food labels to address NCDs in Guatemala."
"9419082","COMMUNITY OUTREACH CORE SUMMARY One of the most important values within SC CADRE is to ensure that principles of community engagement are incorporated at every level within the Center. To realize this value, the SC CADRE leadership has charged the Community Outreach Core, a highly qualified team of community engagement experts, to facilitate ongoing, bi- directional communication between community members, SC CADRE investigators and Scholars to address cancer disparities in South Carolina (SC). This Core will build upon existing community partnerships and collaborations to further develop and sustain a community outreach infrastructure to support and expand the outreach activities associated with SC CADRE-generated research. Core leaders will also engage community and academic (SCSU students, staff, and faculty) stakeholders in the development and deployment of evidence-based approaches to communicate, disseminate, and promote implementation of National Cancer Institute (NCI) recommendations for cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment. The Community Outreach Core also aims to employ lay navigators to assist underserved patients in receiving timely interventions for cancer early detection and treatment, as well as recruit and retain racially and ethnically diverse patients in cancer research. Additionally, the Community Outreach Core will establish an innovative, cancer-focused Community-Engaged Scholars Program to enable the capacity of community-academic partnerships to conduct cancer disparities research. Community outreach, as practiced in the SC CADRE, will be a collaborative effort among partner institutions, communities, and health systems to effectively reach individuals and health care providers with information and tools to improve cancer health outcomes, with the goal of reducing cancer disparities in South Carolina and beyond."
"9304705","Summary Ticks must use their barbed mouthparts (hypostome) to pierce deeply into the host?s dermis (skin), then encase the hypostome in a cement cone in order to maintain a firm, pain and itch- free attachment, subsequently transmitting infectious disease agents into the victim. Two types of cement have been found in ticks; early cement which is secreted only minutes after attachment and hardens rapidly, and late cement which is secreted 24 hours after attachment to the host and hardens gradually. These secreted cement cones are composed of several glycine-rich proteins (GRPs) which are a large family of diverse proteins that are known for their adhesive and tensile characteristics. Such properties may play an important role in host skin attachment to gain an uninterrupted supply of blood over a prolonged period of time. Our long- term plan in the AREA grant application is to reveal the functions and biochemical properties of novel GRPs in cement cone assembly, stealth attachment, hematophagy (blood feeding) and climatic adaptation. We will test our central hypothesis that biochemical and biomechanical properties of GRPs assist in the undetected attachment to the host, providing access to an uninterrupted supply of blood by serving as scaffolding for the cement cone apparatus. Our multidisciplinary team will test the hypothesis using a combination of artificial membrane feeding, structural, proteomics, and reverse genetics approaches. Specific aims are to: 1) determine the role of unique salivary GRPs in cement cone assembly and secure attachment by using an artificial membrane feeding system, and 2) define the biochemical properties of uncharacterized recombinantly expressed cement cone proteins. Targeting tick cement proteins may provide an innovative way to create a hostile situation for tick attachment, and ultimately interrupt the inoculation of tick-borne pathogens into the host. Understanding the mechanisms of cement assembly that allow the tick to secure a stable, stealthy attachment will provide insight into developing new control and prevention methods."
"9452380","The college years present a period of increased psychological distress for many Americans and college students report significant barriers to mental health treatment. The PI's goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in the creation and evaluation of behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) in order to broaden the scope of mental healthcare service availability within existing systems. This proposal outlines a plan to achieve this goal, through the culmination of training and research plans into a successful R01 proposal. The training plan takes full advantage of the strong institutional support and environment at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine and the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies, which is led by the primary mentor for this proposal. Training goals necessary to the PI's career goal include growth in (1) user-centered design for the development of BITs, (2) implementation science, (3) clinical science including qualitative research and new clinical research methodologies, and (4) advanced professional skills. This plan builds on the PI's background in clinical psychology, which has focused on tele- mental health, stress management interventions, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this K08, the PI will extend her work to include new populations (e.g. college students) and settings (college counseling centers) to increase the impact of her research through earlier intervention. The long-terms goal of the research is to integrate BITs into existing university healthcare settings, thus broadening the scope and reach of mental healthcare services. The research plan will develop and test a Student Stress Management (SSM) mobile program based within the framework of an evidence-based treatment for depression and anxiety. This program will increase engagement with mental health treatment, and supplement existing care by serving as an access point to more extensive mental health treatment options and as an independent treatment form. This will be achieved through the following specific aims: 1) to conduct user-centered design and usability testing to refine features and tools of the SSM program and determine feasibility and acceptability of the program for use on campus; 2) to conduct a pilot hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of the SSM program within two university communities; and 3) to obtain preliminary data assessing efficacy the SSM program, changes in hypothesized mechanisms related to efficacy, and university system-level factors that would facilitate or retard the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of the program. These studies are expected to advance the design of BITs for young adults, and improve and increase the use of BITs in university settings, ultimately increasing the reach and impact of evidence-based practices. Skills acquired by carrying out the projects proposed in this application will allow the PI to successfully compete for R01 funding in order to conduct a larger effectiveness-implementation trial."
"9551756","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of California at Los Angeles - Boston University Molecular Characterization Laboratory (UCLA- BU MCL) is a multidisciplinary, translational research program designed to enhance our understanding of the molecular, cellular and imaging features distinguishing indolent from aggressive lung cancers in screen- detected and non-screen-detected clinical settings. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has provided compelling evidence of the efficacy of lung cancer screening using low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) to reduce lung cancer mortality. The benefits of screening, however, must be reconciled with its potential harms, including high false positive rates and the potential for overdiagnosis. Our broad goal is to distinguish indolent from aggressive lesions by interrogating the molecular, microenvironment and imaging features that are associated with clinical outcomes. This global approach brings all aspects of these investigations to bear on our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of early stage lung cancer. These results will be translated to the clinical management of screen-detected lung cancer. Understanding the factors underlying tumor indolence or aggression that result in heterogeneous clinical outcomes will facilitate clinical decision making in the context of lung cancer screening, increase screening effectiveness and ultimately drive care pathways. We hypothesize that the pathways underlying heterogeneity in screen-detected lung cancers will be revealed by analysis of molecular (whole exome and mRNA sequencing), microenvironment (immune and inflammatory mediators) and imaging characteristics (semantic and quantitative features) of screen- detected lesions. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Identify molecular, cellular and imaging profiles that distinguish screen-detected from non-screen- detected lung cancers. Aim 2: Identify molecular, cellular and imaging profiles that distinguish screen-detected lung cancers with indolent versus aggressive clinical courses from the NLST. Aim 3: Confirm and refine molecular, cellular and imaging profiles that distinguish screen-detected lung cancers with indolent versus aggressive clinical courses from a prospectively collected screening cohort. Cases will derive from the NLST biorepository, DECAMP cohorts and a University of California (UC) state-wide initiative involving the five UC academic medical centers that are establishing a common screening policy and platform that involves the collection and archiving of clinical, imaging, and tissue specimens."

"9519367","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The translation of cellular messenger RNAs into distinct structural and functional proteins is central to gene expression in all domains of life an serves as a critical conduit for proteome capacity and diversity. The multistep and highly regulated process of translation is carried out by the ribosome, a two-subunit, RNA-protein assembly that is composed of 70 distinct gene products in bacteria and more than 80 distinct gene products in humans. Although the structural and functional features of the translation mechanism are thought to be conserved throughout evolution, the therapeutic administration of small-molecule antibiotics targeting the bacterial translation machinery continues to serve as a critical safeguard against existing and emerging infectious diseases around the world. Hence, key aspects of the translation mechanism and/or ribosome structure in humans must be distinct from bacteria. The loss of translation control in human cells is linked to cancerous growth and a growing body of knowledge suggests that ribosomes within cancer cells may be physically and functionally distinct. Correspondingly, knowledge of the common and distinct features of bacterial and human ribosomes offers the potential to enable improvements in the efficacies of existing antibiotics, the development of potentially novel means for antibiotic intervention and holds the promise of translation-specific strategies for cancer treatment. Progress on these fronts requires quantitative descriptions of structure-function relationships in the translation machinery of bacteria and humans as well as dynamic aspects of the translation mechanism, including time-dependent changes in ribosome composition and conformation that occur during processive protein synthesis reactions. The proposed research aims to elucidate the molecular basis of ribosome function, the origins of translational fidelity and the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic action using a battery of state-of-the-art biophysical approaches. The methods include single-molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence imaging and rapid-stopped flow kinetics measurements, together with collaborative and complementary efforts in molecular dynamics simulation and high-resolution structure determination. In so doing, we aim to delineate quantitative kinetic and structural models of bacterial and human ribosome function to define key distinctions that will inform on new opportunities for small-molecule interventions for the treatment of infectious pathogens and human disease."
"9536364","Project Summary Globally, the number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is approaching 350 million [1]. With this number rapidly rising, the urgent need for effective therapeutics to treat this disease is also increasing. Research efforts have produced significant advances in treatment options, including the introduction of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors to improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and lower blood glucose. Despite these advances, there remains a gap in the normalization of glucose and the prevention of complications among the population that current treatments have been unable to address, leaving millions of patients with insufficient and unsafe levels of glucose control. Recently, a protease enzyme called fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of T2D and obesity [2]. FAP is the most closely related enzyme to DPP4 [3, 4], a validated drug target. Multiple pharmacological inhibitors of DPP4 are now widely used in patients with T2D [5]. Previous interest in FAP has focused on its potential as a target for cancer therapy due to its upregulation in epithelial tumors [6]. However, recent FAP-specific activity assays have identified FAP activity in the circulation, as well as in several tissues with roles in metabolic regulation [7]. Most intriguingly, preliminary characterization of a global FAP knockout (Fap-/-) mouse demonstrated a) significant protection against diet-induced obesity and b) improved glycemia, phenotypic findings similar to those described in the global DPP4 knockout (Dpp4-/-) mouse [2]. Importantly, FAP has a unique endopeptidase activity, suggesting that its enzymatic targets are different from those of DPP4. Thus, FAP inhibition may provide a novel route to treatment of diabetes. We have independently generated mutant Fap-/- mice, enabling us to determine the metabolic phenotype ensuing from genetic FAP deficiency. Complementary experiments will utilize a potent and specific FAP inhibitor, compound 5057, to determine whether pharmacological FAP inhibition produces the same metabolic benefits observed in Fap-/- mice. Fap-/- mice and wild-type mice treated with compound 5057 will be employed to identify physiological mechanisms (and FAP substrates) underlying the metabolic benefits of FAP inactivation. We are hopeful that this research will lay the groundwork for clinical testing of a new class of drugs for the treatment of T2D."
"9370327","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening condition characterized by a  progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance that can eventually lead to right ventricular  failure and death.  In systemic sclerosis (SSc), PAH is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.  Moreover, patients with SSc-PAH have a poorer prognosis than patients with idiopathic PAH. To  improve treatment options for SSc-PAH, a better understanding of SSc-PAH pathogenesis is needed.  Although the exact pathophysiology of PAH is unknown, abnormal cellular metabolism caused by  altered mitochondrial dynamics, is now considered an important contributor to pathological  alterations in PAH. During the prior grant period, we demonstrated increased endoplasmic reticulum  (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in circulating immune cells (PBMCs) from SSc  patients with limited disease (lcSSc), with even higher levels in lcSSc-PAH patients. We also  demonstrated highly fragmented mitochondria in lcSSc PBMCsM extending these studies to lungs from  SSc-PAH patients undergoing transplantation, we observed highly increased UPR markers in  endothelial cells (EC) and macrophages and evidence of increased oxidation. Given the complex  nature of PAH, a therapeutic agent capable of modulating several key pathways would be an  attractive addition to the treatment regimen of PAH. As a possible candidate, we have focused on  dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an agent that augments the intrinsic cellular antioxidant response and was  recently approved (Tecfidera) for treatment of multiple sclerosis. Using the rodent-hypoxia model  of PH, we found DMF prevented and reversed hemodynamic changes, muscularization of pulmonary  vessels, and right ventricular hypertrophy. DMF also attenuated lung damage caused by oxidative  stress and reduced immune cell infiltration into lungs of treated mice. To translate these results  to human SSc-PAH, we propose:  1) Determine the role of altered mitochondrial dynamics on  activation of immune cells in lcSScM 2) Determine the molecular characteristics of freshly isolated  PAEC from lcSSc patients with and without PAH undergoing right heart catheterizationM and 3)  Determine the effect of DMF on  the function of distal resistance pulmonary arteries from explanted  lungs of patients with SSc-PAH undergoing transplantation. These complementary studies will develop  better understanding of the role of the redox state   in the pathogenesis of SSc-PAH, validate  anti-oxidants, such as DMF, as potential treatment for this entity, and develop collaborative  disease models between Boston University and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centers, two  expert centers with long-standing interest in SSc and SSc-PAH."
"9342738","Project Summary  The Quantitative Proteomics core will provide high-end mass spectrometry based proteomic support to the P01  Project team members to help identify and quantify protein expression and post-translational modifications  (PTMs) on histone and non-histone proteins from various cell lines and brain tumors. Histones are small  proteins that help organize eukaryotic DNA information into nucleosomes, the repeating building blocks of  chromatin. Gene regulation modulated via chromatin remodeling is achieved by the addition of PTMs to  histones or by the incorporation of specialized histone variant members. Dysregulation of these pathways have  been identified in many human disorders and cancers. Most histone related research work is centered on the  use of antibodies that recognize a single histone PTM (Western blot, immunofluorescence, etc.). However,  these types of experiments have drawbacks such as cross-reactivity, potentially limited specificity, and cannot  be used to discover novel histone PTMs. Additionally, these antibodies often have issues with the recognition  of their intended single modification site in modification-dense regions, a phenomenon known as epitope  occlusion. Here we will use our novel mass spectrometry based proteomics platforms and integrated  bioinformatics to comprehensively interrogate the PTM profiles of histones extracted from model cell lines,  primary cells and tumor tissue harboring histone mutations. These experiments will allow for precise  measurement of the abundance of over 100 different histone modification and variant proteoforms.  Additionally, the Garcia lab has produced arguably the best platform for analysis of combinatorial histone  modifications to determine crosstalk relationships between different modified sites. Studies aimed to isolate  chromatin from specific cancer related genes will also be performed to understand the local histone  environment contributing to tumoregenesis. We will also perform experiments to identify proteins that bind to  specific cancer enriched histone PTMs (e.g. histone readers), or non-histone proteins that are modified  themselves and may affect chromatin networks that modulate crucial gene expression programs."
"9454816","Project Abstract Complications of alcoholism such as stroke and cardiomyopathy are leading causes of death among adults. The underlying pathophysiology of these events involves lipids within susceptible arteries leading to subsequent localized inflammation and vascular dysfunction. While the bioactive glycerophospholipid lysophosphatidic acid plays a well-known role in atherosclerotic disease, its role in alcohol-mediated cerebral dysfunction remains virtually unexplored. Lysophosphatidic acid production involves hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine by the secreted enzyme autotaxin, whereas lipid phosphate phosphatase-3 (LPP3) catalyzes lysophosphatidic acid dephosphorylation to generate lipid products that are not receptor active. In this application, we present the first evidence that heavy alcohol consumption (HAC) enhances the cerebrovascular autotaxin levels and decreases LPP3 expression, and this is associated with increased lysophosphatidic acid signaling. Upon HAC, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases in the cerebrovasculature, whereas the redox-sensitive transcription factor NFAT (a nuclear factor of activated T-cells) has been shown to bind to the autotaxin promoter and induce its expression. Similarly, oxidant stress may deplete LPP3 levels in the context of HAC through reduced LPP3 expression or enhanced LPP3 degradation. Thus, we hypothesize that HAC alters autotaxin and LPP3 expression through ROS production to drive lysophosphatidic acid signaling and cerebrovascular dysfunction. The following interrelated specific aims are designed to provide step-wise and in-depth studies in vitro, in vivo, and in experimental therapeutics settings. Specific aim 1 will assess the role of ROS production in autotaxin expression and lysophosphatidic acid production in the cerebrovasculature following HAC. Specific aim 2 will determine the role of ROS production in LPP3 depletion and LPA production in the cerebrovasculature following HAC. We could identify whether modulation of cellular versus mitochondrial antioxidant status confers a differential protective effect following HAC. Our results should provide specific insight into signaling systems mediated by HAC and may provide novel targets for treatment and might improve cerebrovascular disorders."
"9348658","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 disseminates rapidly in infected individuals. This can at least partially be attributed to virus transfer between T lymphocytes, which occurs very efficiently when infected and uninfected T cells directly contact each other, thus forming the so-called virological synapse (VS). While many features of this transient adhesion structure remain undefined, we know that VS formation necessitates an interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), which is expressed at the surface of infected (virus producing) cells, with the viral receptor on uninfected (target) cells. It is not understood, however, why such interactions between Env, which mediates fusion of the viral particle with target cell membranes, and the viral receptor/coreceptor do not routinely result in producer-target cell fusion and thus the formation of a syncytium. Small T cell-based syncytia have been observed in lymph nodes of infected individuals and in humanized mice, but it is evident that most encounters between infected and uninfected cells resolve without fusion. Indeed, fusion-less encounters between these cells are a sine qua non for three central features of HIV-1 pathogenesis: cell-to-cell transmission, killing of bystander cells, and establishment and maintenance of a reservoir of latently infected T lymphocytes. Hence, revealing how fusion between infected and uninfected cells is regulated will not only contribute to our knowledge about how the virus can be efficiently transmitted from cell to cell, it will also aid understanding of key aspects of HIV-1 pathogenesis. We thus propose to investigate how both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors, together, facilitate disengagement of producer and target cells upon virus transfer. It will also be tested whether enhancing fusion between the cells beyond the normal level is detrimental to virus dissemination."
"9419077","SUMMARY This five-year U54 proposal is a collaborative, inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU), an Historically Black University (HBCU), and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. The partnership began in 2011 under the auspices of an NCI P20 CPACHE grant and has grown to produce this U54 South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) application. With input from their joint community partner, the Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg Mabry Cancer Center (RMC-MCC), investigators at both institutions collaborated to design the SC CADRE. The overarching goals of the SC CADRE are to increase SCSU's capacity to conduct transdisciplinary cancer research and to further strengthen and extend a longitudinal research education pipeline that will catalyze a new diverse generation of biomedical researchers focused on cancer disparities. The SC CADRE has three major themes. The first focuses on evaluating the relationship between obesity and prostate and breast cancer disparities. The second theme emphasizes evaluation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) as a novel biomarker related to cancer, cancer disparities, and obesity. The third theme highlights the inclusion of a population unique to the US southeastern coastal region, the Sea Island (SI)/Gullah population. Within five years, the SC CADRE aims for: 1) further elucidation of molecular mechanisms contributing to cancer disparities; 2) an enhanced pipeline of diverse cancer researchers; 3) an increased number of NIH research proposals led by SCSU faculty as independent investigators; and 4) greater community engagement in cancer research. Due to the longstanding SCSU /MUSC-HCC academic partnership and each entity's research and educational strengths and community relationships, the SC CADRE is poised to transform cancer health outcomes for South Carolinians."

"9551768","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a common and lethal disease, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 6%. The unique tumor microenvironment prevents the disease from being eradicated, even when surgery is combined with chemotherapy. Specifically, the absence of a functional vasculature and the build-up of dense stromal regions impede drug delivery. Consequently, several researchers are actively developing therapies to improve drug delivery. Besides improving drug delivery, we should also track cancer cell growth and other features of the tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that information about changes in stromal stiffness, cancer cell growth, and drug delivery will help clinical researchers evaluate novel therapies that improves drug delivery, such as radiotherapy and immunotherapy or hyaluronic acid ablation. Since vascular imaging techniques (e.g., MRI and CT) cannot provide this data, we will develop an integrated system of shear wave ultrasound elastography (USE) and optical fluorescence tomography (OFT). We will conduct this work in two phases. In the first phase, we will develop the integrated USE/OFT system (Aim 1). This hybrid system will provide co-registered images of shear modulus, which is related to total tissue pressure and drug delivery. We will use three models (an orthotopic pancreas xenograft model, a transgenic spontaneous tumor model, and a murine pancreatic cancer model) to characterize and optimize the system's performance in vivo. The xenograft AsPC-1 model is well-controlled with 5-25% stromal content and low vascular space (< 0.5%) when grown in the pancreas. We will also use the transgenic murine model, which more closely recapitulates the molecular phenotype of human PDA to validate performance (Aim 2). The murine pancreatic model will be used to study the efficacy of different therapeutic approaches for improving drug delivery. In these studies, we will assess the sensitivity of the proposed system to changes in mechanical properties and vascular permeability during the growth phase of PDA, as well as during hyaluronidase enzymatic treatment of the extracellular matrix and combinational therapy (immuno-enhanced radiotherapy). In the second phase (Aim 3), we will (a) translate the USE and OFT technology to an endoscopic platform; and (b) conduct preliminary safety and efficacy evaluation in a rabbit model of pancreatic cancer to prepare for human use. This last aim will provide data required to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and for human use with the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) to monitor changes in tumor microenvironment during combinational therapies as assessed here pre-clinically. The proposed team includes expertise in elastography, ultrasound transducer design, OFT, PDA models, and human pancreatic cancer. Together this is an ideal group to translate the technology through the research phase and into an alpha commercial prototype for clinical trials."
"9382098","The long-term goal of my research program is to understand the biological basis for individual variation. The genetic architecture of complex traits is not a static blueprint of the phenotype as it was previously thought; rather, it is highly dynamic and context-dependent. I seek to understand how genes interact with each other and their environment to shape variation between individuals and what factors control the degree of individual variability. Technological advances have recently fueled the ascent of personal genomics and the promise of precision medicine. The success of medical genetics will depend on its capacity to personalize, however, individualized prediction is a grand challenge. When the average effect of an allele does not capture a specific allelic contribution under certain conditions (whether due to genetic background or the environment), the link between genotype and phenotype will be missed. Given such context dependency, understanding how genotypic variation influences variation in an individual's phenotype demands a shift in focus from population averages to individual effects. Globally, we are witnessing the rise of complex diseases related to dramatic changes in our daily environments. These disorders have a clear environmental basis, but they also show strong familial correlations: susceptibility to these diseases is highly heritable. Despite considerable effort and resources, we have made little progress in understanding the genetic basis of these common conditions. This highlight the need for a different approach to identify the causal genetic factors underlying disorders characterized by non-additive interactions. To date, a key limitation to address this problem has been that small sample sizes and skewed allele frequency spectrum limit the power of detecting genetic associations. We have solved this problem by creating a new community resource made of large, synthetic outbred populations. This enables us to break away from traditional, artificial and underpowered approaches that have relied on inbred strains. In parallel, we have developed a molecular and analytical pipeline allowing us to sequence thousands of single flies at high throughput with very low cost and reliable accuracy. With this new and versatile resource, we can rear thousands of genetically unique flies drawn from a common genetic pool, expose them to a range of different environments, and contrast the ensuing genetic architectures. Our inability to make progress in human genetics for diseases with strong environmental components suggests a fundamental knowledge gap that my research addresses in a powerful model system. Given that in humans there is extreme variation and stochasticity in environmental exposure, we need a predictive framework that can accommodate these individual-specific impacts. My research program paves a path to personalized phenotypic prediction by unlocking the context dependence of allelic effects."

"9280279","ABSTRACT  Cancer Racial disparity is a serious medical concern. One factor driving this phenomenon is the lack of racially diverse individuals engaged in research and medical intervention. Due to a history of mistrust and disenfranchisement, African and Hispanic Americans seek medical assistance later and, thereby, present with advanced medical issues (i.e., late stage cancers). The absence of individuals of color in key positions within universities and hospitals diminish diverse perspectives in research choices and a sense of kinship between faculty/physicians and students/patients. This can be ameliorated by building a diverse population of faculty and clinical investigators. This is critical in efforts to reduce medical issues such as cancer health disparity. The long-term goal of this proposed project is to increase the numbers of underrepresented minority students pursuing research careers in the biomedical sciences with an emphasis on studying the biology of cancer. The overall strategy is to recruit and select highly qualified students and to provide them with quality laboratory experiences. This will enable them to develop qualifications and references needed for entry into the strongest graduate/medical programs in the country.  The objectives of the ?Increasing Diversity in Undergraduate Cancer Biology Education and Research (INDUCER)? program are: 1) to identify underrepresented minority students at Stony Brook University interested in research careers in cancer biology or related biomedical sciences and encourage their participation; 2) to motivate these students to obtain degrees in cancer biology or related biomedical sciences; 3) to help these students gain confidence in their abilities by early exposure to laboratory experiences, research, public speaking and biomedical researchers; 4) to create a positive environment through the use of group activities, mentoring and advising; 5) to promote an awareness of the opportunities available in biomedical research through peer, graduate student and faculty mentoring; and 6) to create a model for outreach and undergraduate education in STEM at Stony Brook that will demonstrate how other research universities can accomplish similar objectives. Overall, this proposal is designed to attract students to the field of cancer biology, encourage students to enroll in STEM and, once enrolled, to remain in this field of study."
"9436092","PROJECT SUMMARY The primary objective of this research initiative is to evaluate how the metal-sequestering human host-defense protein calprotectin (CP) affects metal homeostasis and physiology of bacterial pathogens. Metal ions are essential nutrients for all organisms, and pathogens must acquire these nutrients from the host to replicate and cause infection. During this process, the human innate immune system works to limit the bioavailability of transition metals including manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) by deploying CP and other metal- sequestering proteins at sites of infection. CP is accepted to withhold Mn(II) and Zn(II) from microbial pathogens, and we recently demonstrated that CP coordinates Fe in the reduced ferrous oxidation state. Bacterial systems for Fe(II) acquisition are increasingly appreciated as critical for pathogenesis in multiple infection states, including chronic, biofilm-mediated infections where oxygen becomes limiting. However, no other host-defense proteins that limit Fe(II) have been identified; thus investigating CP as an Fe(II)- sequestering host-defense protein is important for understanding host-pathogen interactions in chronic infection states. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) are two human pathogens that cause chronic polymicrobial infections in diverse patient populations, including lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). This hereditary disease predisposes individuals to life-long pulmonary infections, marked by debilitating exacerbations that reduce lung function. Notably, the CF lung becomes increasingly hypoxic as disease progresses, and multiple lines of evidence indicate that Fe(II) becomes the predominant form of bioavailable Fe. Progression of CF lung disease is also correlated with a shift in microbial etiology, with Sa being the predominant microorganism in younger patients, and subsequent Pa colonization associated with lung function decline. The underlying biology that causes this population shift remains poorly understood; however, recent studies suggest that both Fe and CP contribute to this process. We hypothesize that CP limits Fe(II) availability in hypoxic environments, as found in the CF lung, and that this activity eventually allows Pa to outcompete Sa in polymicrobial environments. In Aim 1, we will evaluate Fe(II) sequestration by CP, and map the distribution of metal ions in Pa and Sa cultures treated with CP. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CP limits Fe(II) to Pa and Sa, and thereby impacts the individual physiologies and co-culture dynamics of these two pathogens. These investigations will enable future studies that address how CP and Fe drive the progression of CF lung infections, and may guide the design and development of novel diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic approaches to treat bacterial infections."
"9392860","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility and is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and elevated androgens. The central neuronal system that regulates downstream reproductive function communicates through gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Shifts in GnRH pulse frequency during the normal menstrual cycle signal the pituitary to release hormones that regulate follicular maturation and ovarian steroid production. Hormonal feedback is conveyed to GnRH neurons through their afferent network, however the circuitry and activity of this network is not well understood. In most adult women with PCOS this neuronal system is persistently overactive leading to failure of ovulation and high androgen production. When this increased neuroendocrine activity begins is not known, however neuronal hyperactivity during development could result in altered network connectivity and function in adulthood. Exposure to elevated androgens during development results in phenotypes that are similar to PCOS in many species. Our hypothesis is that GnRH neuron activity during the prepubertal period is critical for attracting appropriate synaptic inputs and that prenatal androgenization (PNA) alters this activity  and synaptogenesis and thus the adult connectivity and function of the GnRH neuronal circuitry. To test this hypothesis we will study how PNA alters the adult organization of the GnRH neuronal network and the function of afferent inputs to GnRH neurons during prepubertal development. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that PNA increases the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic and glutamatergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs) to prepubertal GnRH neurons and that this occurs through an increased density of synaptic connections. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings of PSCs will be made to examine the spontaneous function of these inputs during prepubertal development. Evoked activity will be used to identify synaptic connections that have been established but are not yet active. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to elevated androgens results in altered adult organization of the presynaptic network to GnRH neurons in females. We will utilize a viral tracer targeted to Cre recombinase-expressing GnRH neurons to map the circuitry of the GnRH neuronal network in combination with immunofluorescence and/or in situ hybridization to identify neuron phenotype. This will allow us to characterize the number, location and identify of GnRH neuron afferents and to examine if this connectivity is altered by developmental exposure to androgens. Both Aims will further our knowledge of typical GnRH neuron development beyond the study of individual neurons to comprehension of network interactions with great potential to address long-standing questions about hypothalamic regulation of fertility. They will also further our understanding of how PNA alters the GnRH neuronal network. The broad implications and intellectual depth of this project are essential elements for my training as a physician-scientist."
"9419232","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In order to move closer to achieving the goals of precision medicine and individualized cancer care, participation in biobanking from large numbers of individuals representing all ethnicities is essential. The scarcity of tissues available at existing biobanks from racial and ethnic minorities poses a substantial constraint to conducting research needed to understand the biological basis of health disparities. Because cancer- causing genetic alterations vary across individuals and ethnicities, the practice of precision medicine requires knowledge acquired through the study of tumor tissue derived from individuals representing diverse populations. It is important to recognize that Hispanic/Latino (H/L) ethnicity is an admixture of European, African, and Amerindians ancestral genomes, the proportions of which vary widely across individuals from different geographical regions. Also, there are differences in cancer trends associated to cancer biology and admixture genetics among different H/L sub-populations. Despite being a large proportion of the ethnic minorities living in the US, to date, there has been no comprehensive availability of tumor tissue from H/L cancer patients in national biobanks. To address this disparity, we propose to continue to develop the existing research infrastructure of the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB) to support research initiatives designed to understand the biological basis of cancer health disparities. The purpose of the PRBB is to facilitate the optimal collection, processing, storage, and distribution of well-annotated human biospecimens derived from the island?s H/L population for use in investigator-initiated translational cancer research. Throughout the past 10 years, a solid infrastructure has been put in place to develop this unique biorepository in Puerto Rico. Through this resource, fresh frozen tissues, paraffin blocks, high-quality tumor-derived RNA, genomic DNA, and clinical and risk factor information are available to support research at both institutions focusing on molecular aspects and determinants of cancer health disparities involving H/L living in Florida and Puerto Rico.  We propose to expand the existing Partnership?s biobank via three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we propose to continue the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of biospecimens in collaboration with local hospitals and clinics. In cooperation with the Partnership?s Outreach Core, efforts to consent healthy individuals during community outreach educational activities will continue. In Aim 2, we propose to extend the documentation of demographic, clinical, pathological, and molecular data (?omic?, ancestry, next-gen sequence data) in collaboration with the Quantitative Sciences Core. In Aim 3, we propose to foster new collaborative research projects focused on cancer research. As facilitator of translational research, the PRBB is placed at the forefront of the Precision Medicine initiative programmatic goals of improving disease risk prediction and developing diagnosis and treatment strategies based on individual differences in genes, lifestyle, and environment, focusing on a population that is under-represented in biobanks and research."
"9433378","Project Summary  Metabolites are building blocks of cellular function, thus understanding the mechanisms that underlie various physiological conditions and processes will provide insight into disease or aberrant states. Innovative developments in high-throughput analytical technologies and data analysis have allowed for systems-level metabolomics analyses to be performed, many of these technologies have centered around mass spectrometry. The diverse chemical structures in the human metabolome exhibit a wide range of concentration, solubility, polarity and volatility with highly diverse structural forms and physiochemical properties as well as a high number of isomers, therefore the need for as many orthogonal separations as possible is necessary for metabolomics experiments (i.e., multidimensional data sets). Mass spectrometry approaches incorporating liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/MS) analyses have shown utility for global untargeted metabolic profiling experiments. Since ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a relatively new commercially available technology, the incorporation of the ion mobility measurement (via collision cross section, CCS) into current metabolomics data analysis identification strategies is minimal. The typical analytical use of ion mobility is as a quick chemical separation (which allows for noise reduction, increase in peak capacity, etc.), however IM can also be used to increase the confidence in identification and characterization because CCS provides structure specific information about individual metabolites. The long term objectives of this proposal are all centered around incorporating IM measurements into metabolomics based chemoinformatic and bioinformatics pipelines. These include: (1) determining the extent at which the ion mobility dimension can address molecular specificity of isomeric metabolites, (2) developing an IM-based library using CCS values as a descriptor to screen and assign identities to unknown metabolites and lastly, (3) incorporating visualization tools for navigating multidimensional datasets which will allow scientists to better uncover relationships between metabolites and human health. Molecular specificity of the IM dimension will be addressed by analyzing previously generated IM-MS data from a commercially available metabolite library (>600 primary metabolites, of which >20% are isomeric). Individual metabolites in the metabolite library will also be interrogated for curation of the CCS library and these values will be used in the molecular identification pipeline for global untargeted metabolite studies generated previously. Lastly, multidimensional self-organizing maps will be utilized to visualize and navigate various dimensions of data (LC, CCS, m/z, etc.) and ultimately allow the user to prioritize and identify with high confidence metabolites indicative of disease state. Accomplishing the aims outlined in this proposal will be seen as overcoming several critical barriers which have so far hindered the routine and widespread use of ion mobility in MS-based metabolomics workflows."
"9415585","ABSTRACT Recent converging evidence suggests that communication between the immune system and the brain is critical for controlling inflammation. The brain receives information in response to injury induced inflammation in the periphery which in turn initiates a reflex mechanism to suppress immune responses. The resulting neuroendocrine reflex plays an important regulatory role in the immune system. These bidirectional brain-peripheral immune communications operate reflexively, in a closed feedback loop whereby neural circuits can exert significant influence to modulate inflammation. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this brain-immune signaling are largely unknown. Therefore, understanding the distinct molecular and neurophysiological mechanisms that govern these complex pathways is critical, which motivates us to develop new approaches to accurately detect and monitor these changes. We will develop nanosensors for the detection of neurotransmitter release in the peripheral nervous system of axolotls (regenerating salamanders). Our nanosensors are based on a modular platform that can easily be tuned to an appropriate dynamic range, wavelengths for tissue penetration, and size to be compatible with the in vivo environment. The juvenile axolotl is highly transparent and nanosensors injected into the nervous system or organs will be imaged using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. In addition, we have the ability to genetically modify the system to develop a transgenic model that can be stimulated with light to target neuronal excitations, while simultaneously measuring neurotransmitter levels via the fluorescence emitted from the injected nanosensors. Combined, we will image volumetric release of acetylcholine in the peripheral nervous system and spleen of the axolotl, and will translate these results to a mammalian model by the end of the project period."
"9296616","Project Summary The National Research Council has defined Precision Medicine as ?the tailoring of medical treatments to individual characteristics of each patient.? This requires the ability to classify patients into specialized cohorts that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of the diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Identifying quantitative imaging phenotypes across scale through the use of radiomic/pathomic analyses is an evolving approach to cohort identification and to improving our understanding of cancer biology. These analytic techniques require large collections of well-curated data for algorithm testing and validation. Additional big data collections are required to test new hypotheses relating to cancer biology, prognosis and therapy response. Since 2011 the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) has encouraged and supported cancer-related open science research by acquiring, curating, hosting and managing collections of multi-modal information. To remain relevant to its current research community and ready to support future research initiatives TCIA must undergo continuous improvement and expansion of it capabilities guided by the research community. The TCIA user community has identified four critical areas for improvement: expanded resources for integrative Image-Omics studies, enhanced capacity to acquire high quality data collections, resources to support validation studies and Research Reproducibility, and increased community engagement. The sustainment of TCIA and research community directed expansion of its capabilities will ensure this valuable resource continues to support its rapidly growing user community and continue to promote research reproducibility and data reuse in cancer precision medical research."
"9389588","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the U.S. and the primary prevention of this disease is a major public health issue. Breast cancer chemoprevention with antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, and exemestane, is underutilized, despite several randomized controlled trials demonstrating a 50-65% decrease in breast cancer incidence among high-risk women. Many women may be unaware of their high-risk status due to our inability to adequately screen them in the primary care setting. Other reasons for low uptake include inadequate time for counseling, insufficient knowledge about risk- reducing strategies, and concerns about side effects. Women from racial/ethnic minorities are less likely to seek preventive measures, contributing to poorer clinicl outcomes in these populations compared to non- Hispanic whites. We hypothesize that combining a patient-centered decision aid with a physician-centered decision support tool integrated into clinic workflow will improve accuracy of breast cancer risk perception, facilitate referrals for specialized risk counseling, and increase chemoprevention uptake.  In our breast clinic, the chemoprevention uptake rate among high-risk women is 37%, compared to less than 5% reported for other high-risk populations. Our goal is to expand our success in the breast clinic by offering specialized risk counseling to a broader population of racially/ethnically divere women screened in the primary care setting. We will use a novel breast cancer risk navigation (BNAV) tool, which incorporates the Gail breast cancer risk model into the electronic health record. To address patient-related barriers to chemoprevention, our research group developed an initial prototype of a decision aid, RealRisks, that allows participants to experience risk through an activity. We propose to conduct the following aims: 1a) To apply a user-centered design to evaluate and refine RealRisks for breast cancer chemoprevention; 1b) To evaluate the effects of RealRisks on accuracy of breast cancer risk perception among 50 high-risk women identified at our breast clinic and high-risk registries; 2a) To design and evaluate BNAV for primary care providers to facilitate the identification of high-risk women eligible for chemoprevention; 2b) To compare referral rates to the breast clinic among 50 high-risk women screened in primary care clinics randomized to BNAV vs. no BNAV; 3) To conduct a randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design of RealRisks and BNAV, either alone or in combination, compared to usual care in 400 high-risk women identified in the primary care setting. The primary endpoint is chemoprevention uptake at 6 months. Secondarily, we will assess accuracy of risk perception, referral rates to the breast clinic, and various patient- and physician-reported outcomes.  This proposal seeks to overcome important barriers to chemoprevention uptake in the primary care setting. Given the proven efficacy of antiestrogens for primary prevention in high-risk populations, higher uptake of breast cancer chemoprevention may significantly reduce the public health burden of this disease."
"9445042","PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical and epidemiological evidence suggests that ~40% of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) left untreated will progress to invasive breast cancer. However, due to our inability to distinguish lesions that will progress to invasive cancer from those that will remain non-invasive indefinitely, all DCIS patients are treated with surgery with or without radiation. This overtreatment dilemma demands the need for individualized patient care based on biomarkers that predict which patients will progress. Unfortunately, very little is known about how pre-invasive DCIS cells acquire the ability to invade the adjacent stroma, and how the stroma influences localized invasion has not been studied. The proposed studies aim to define the molecular interactions between infiltrating macrophages and pre-invasive epithelial cells, and uncover the mechanisms that promote tumor development in early stage lesions. Using unique preclinical models of early progression, we show that macrophages are recruited to pre-invasive lesions that have a high tumor-forming potential, polarized toward a pro-tumorigenic phenotype, and secrete the cytokine Gas6. We hypothesize that macrophages recruited to pre-invasive lesions induce cell survival and localized invasion in a Gas6-dependent manner. This hypothesis will be tested by the following aims: Aim 1: To define the oncogenic potential of Axl during mammary tumor initiation. Aim 2: To delineate the contribution of paracrine, autocrine and ligand-independent Axl signaling in early stage lesions. Aim 3: To decipher Axl transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and identify Gas6- dependent tumor-promoting pathways. Our studies will utilize several mouse models, a unique xenograft model of DCIS progression, and a heterotypic 3-D culture system to dissect Gas6-mediated macrophage- epithelial crosstalk. Significance: The proposed studies will identify a mechanism by which DCIS cells proliferate and/or invade the basement membrane, and define how the stroma promotes progression to invasive cancer, addressing major knowledge gaps in the field of premalignancy. Recent studies suggest that the dissemination of cancer cells occurs as early as the premalignant stage, which begs the need to understand the mechanisms of cell migration and invasion in early stage lesions. Finally, Gas6 and Axl have been correlated with poor overall survival and therapy resistance in a number of cancers. Our findings will significantly advance the fields of DCIS biology and early stage breast cancer progression."

"9339516","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic skin wounds in the diabetic patient population are a major health problem for the Nation and the VA. Only one biologic, PDGF-BB (becaplermin Gel), is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to treat diabetic lower limb skin wounds. However, the modest efficacy and expense of this product have limited its use in the clinic. During the last VA grant cycle, we have identified the extracellular form of heat shock protein 90alpha (Hsp90?) as an agent that promotes the cellular migration of human keratinocytes, human dermal fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells, the very cells involved in skin wound healing. Moreover, Hsp90? (and its smaller F-5 fragment) when added topically to skin wounds of normal and diabetic mice dramatically accelerates the wound closure. Our hypothesis is that Hsp90? accelerates the closure of skin wounds by promoting migration of keratinocytes (for re-epithelialization), dermal fibroblasts (for fibroplasia) and microvascular endothelial cells (for no-vascularization). No single conventional growth factor is able to do the same. In this proposal, we wish to test the efficacy of recombinant Hsp90? and F-5 to accelerate wound closure in normal and diabetic pigs, the animal species whose skin is biologically the closest to human skin. We will evaluate the rate of wound closure, the quality of the healed wounds with regard to scarring and any degree of regenerative (rather than reparative) wound healing. Secondly, we will explore the mechanisms by which diabetes inhibits the closure of skin wounds and determine how topically administered Hsp90? rescues the basic biological perturbation in diabetic skin wounds, as we previously reported in db/db mice. With these mechanistic studies paired with our porcine in vivo wound healing data, we will be poised to advance this potential agent for preparation of an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA and human clinical trials."
"9379210","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal titled ?MicroRNA-based interventions to prevent progression from lung preneoplasia to adenocarcinoma? is responsive to PQ1. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advances in detection and improvements to standard of care, the overall survival rate for lung cancer patients remains very low (5). This poor survival rate is probably due to the relatively advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. If lung cancer could be identified and stopped at a preneoplastic stage prior to progression into advanced stage, we could improve the patients' survival. However, little is known about the biomarkers distinguishing preneoplasia from normal tissues and the molecules driving preneoplasia initiation and progression. Recent evidence has shown that intratumor cellular heterogeneity contributes to tumor initiation and progression of cancer, including lung cancer (6). Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of the bulk of tumor cells that can recapitulate the whole tumor's heterogeneous structures and functionally drive tumorigenesis. Nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) is the key mediators of the inflammation response and has been recently been implicated as a driver of TICs (7). More recently, it has been found that inflammation can change expression of some microRNAs (miRNAs), including upregulation of oncogenic miR-21 (8). MiRNAs are non-coding RNAs belonging to a novel class of regulatory molecules that control gene expression by binding to complementary sites on multiple target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts simultaneously (9). However, the signaling events that link cancer stemness-related miRNAs to preneoplasia initiation and progression in inflammatory microenvironments remain to be charted. We hypothesize that inflammation induced miRNA dysregulation on TICs might drive preneoplasia initiation and progression in KRASmut or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRmut) lung adenocarcinoma patients, and that a deeper understanding of this may identify novel targets for miRNA-based therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will characterize a miRNA signature in preneoplasia in lung tissues. In Aim 2, we will investigate roles of miRNA inhibitors or mimics in preventing progression from preneoplasia to neoplasia in lung. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have generated a new tumor organoid model, developed miRNA therapeutics useful in curing preneoplasia and preventing malignant progression, as well as gained innovative information regarding roles of both TICs and the inflammatory niche in preneoplasia initiation and progression."
"9453798","PROJECT SUMMARY Over 90% of morbidity and mortality related to non-communicable diseases occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Despite the growing burden of disease, countries like Uganda are ill equipped to prevent and manage the epidemic. Uganda has been the site of numerous successful research collaborations for over 20 decades which have contributed the knowledge of the pathogenesis, epidemiology and management of a range of infectious diseases, including HIV, TB and malaria. As a result of these studies, there is a cadre of successful independent investigators who have participated in the control of these conditions. There remains little locally-generated data concerning prevalence, risk factors and locally-appropriate management strategies for NCDs. A comprehensive NCD research-training program is urgently needed that encompasses multiple priority NCDs and is integrated within the exiting public health system. The goal of this planning grant is to develop the required components for an application for a comprehensive multi-specialty research-training program concerning non-communicable diseases at Makerere University in Uganda. The specific objectives of this grant are to: (1) formalize a planning committee to develop and apply for an NCD D43 research-training program, (2) conduct a systematic survey to assess the existing NCD research and research training capacity at Makerere University and proposed collaborators' institutions, (3) define a pool of potential trainees that could be recruited for NCD research training, (4) develop a comprehensive NCD research training D43 grant application based on needs identified at MakCHS and (5) mobilize all ongoing collaborative NCD research activities at Makerere University, Ministry of Health and other institutions to create a center of excellence for NCD research and training for Sub-Saharan Africa."
"9429388","PROJECT SUMMARY  Dental pulp tissue exposed to a mechanical trauma or cariogenic process can result in root canal and/or periapical infections, which can be treated via an endodontic procedure. A regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) attempts to revitalize pulp-dentin tissue from a previously necrotic or inflamed pulp, thus, allowing for continued development of the pulp-dentin structure, particularly for a young immature root. However, the current REP has resulted in unfavorable outcomes, including tooth discoloration, cervical root fractures, inadequate pulp-dentin tissue structure formation, and multiple clinic visits.  In order to tackle the challenges of the current REP, a highly interdisciplinary and innovative strategy is proposed for efficient root canal disinfection and pulp-dentin tissue revitalization using an antibiotics and nitric oxide (NO) releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel. We hypothesize that the antibiotics and NO releasing nanomatrix gel will demonstrate an efficient antibacterial effect and recruit endogenous stem cells to induce pulp-dentin revitalization, while providing a favorable pulp-dentin tissue mimicking extracellular matrix environment. The proposed strategy has several advantages over the current REP: 1) preventing tooth discolorations by removal of minocycline, 2) preventing cervical root fractures by avoidance of calcium hydroxide, 3) antibacterial effect of the NO, 4) sustained NO release from the nanomatrix gel by enzyme mediated degradation, 5) reducing inflammatory responses by avoidance of reopening root canals and stimulated bleeding, 6) biocompatibility and biodegradability of the nanomatrix gel as a functional extracellular matrix, and 7) less extensive pulp access opening, clinical visits, and restorations with cost-effective materials such as composites resin.  Therefore, three specific aims are proposed to evaluate the hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate the anti-biofilm effects of the antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel in clinical samples from the endodontic infection. Specific Aim 2 is to evaluate the cellular effects of the antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel on dental pulp stem cells. Specific Aim 3 is to develop a beagle infected tooth model and evaluate the revitalization capacity of the antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel. The outcomes from this proposal will demonstrate the anti-biofilm effect and revitalization potential of the antibiotics and NO releasing nanomatrix gel for the treatment of endodontic infections. Further, the outcomes will also lead to future clinical studies for a young immature root as well as a mature root canal infection with traumatic exposure and bacterial associated cases."
"9352327","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks to establish a Clinical Center (CC) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to conduct studies on chronic pancreatitis (CP), diabetes, and pancreatic cancer (RFA-DK-14-027). Drs. Stephen Pandol and Mark Goodarzi (PDs) have assembled a team of gastroenterologists, endocrinologists, physiologists, and epidemiologists who are eager to collaborate in the Consortium in translational pancreatic research. Aside from a track record in clinical investigation and prospective follow-up studies that are the foundation for the proposed CC, our location in Los Angeles County (>9 million inhabitants) affords the Consortium research opportunities in diverse populations through our clinical partners at UCLA and other large medical centers in the region. We have also partnered with productive pancreatology colleagues from Auckland (New Zealand). The proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms underlying glucose intolerance in CP. Pancreatogenic diabetes (i.e., Type 3c diabetes, T3cDM) develops in most individuals with CP. The risk for pancreatic cancer in patients with both pancreatitis and diabetes is increased 33-fold. Prevention of pancreatitis progression and diabetes (and thus pancreatic cancer) is a critical goal of the Consortium. The following outlines study aims that will be proposed to the Steering Committee once the Consortium is implemented:  Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that chronic pancreatitis patients with prediabetes have insulin resistance as well as impaired insulin secretion. Patients with and without CP and with and without prediabetes (4 groups) will undergo the frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests to characterize insulin resistance, insulin secretion, insulin clearance; and incretin and islet hormonal responses. In focusing on prediabetes, this Aim will identify early defects that predispose to T3cDM. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that pancreatic enzyme insufficiency in chronic pancreatitis leads to attenuated incretin responses and consequent deficient insulin secretion. The subjects from Aim 1 who have CP and prediabetes will be treated with 2 weeks of pancreatic enzyme supplementation (PES), followed by a repeat physiologic evaluation. It is anticipated that PES will result in augmented incretin responses to a meal, resulting in improved insulin secretion and reduction in glucose levels. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that metformin treatment will prevent development of diabetes in patients with acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis. The ability of metformin to prevent Type 3c diabetes is unknown. We will conduct a diabetes prevention study of metformin versus placebo in these patients. Research in CP and pancreatic cancer research requires diverse leadership and multiple clinical sites. We have assembled experts for our CC with skills not always addressing the proposed Aims in recognition of the broad scope of experience and expertise needed to optimize the Consortium's potential. We are committed to interaction with the NIDDK/NCI, the other CCs, and the Coordination and Data Management Center."
"9395432","PROJECT SUMMARY Dysregulation of autonomic control of the heart can provoke arrhythmias, predisposing individuals to potentially life-threatening medical problems such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Many of the medications currently available for treating arrhythmias exhibit limited efficacy and/or the potential for long-term pro-arrhythmic side effects. Accordingly, it is important to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac rhythmicity, so that new and safer approaches for the treatment of arrhythmias can be developed. A long-term goal of our research is to better understand the mechanisms underlying the parasympathetic regulation of the heart and to investigate the therapeutic potential of manipulating relevant signaling pathways for the treatment of rhythm disorders. To this end, we and others have shown that a signaling pathway consisting of the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) and IKACh, a G protein-gated K channel  + formed by GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits, mediates much of the parasympathetic influence on heart rate and atrial physiology. While recent evidence suggests that the parasympathetic system also regulates ventricular physiology, the molecular mechanisms underlying this influence are less clear. One goal of this project is to delineate the mechanisms and relevance of the parasympathetic influence on ventricular physiology (AIM 1), testing the working hypothesis that this influence is mediated by an M2R-IKACh signaling pathway in ventricular myocytes. I will test this hypothesis using a unique array of constitutive and tissue-specific knockout mice, together with whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and in vivo electrocardiogram (ECG) approaches. A second goal of this project is to begin exploring the therapeutic potential of IKACh modulators in the context of cardiac rhythm disorders (AIM 2). While numerous studies support the contention that IKACh agonists and antagonists could be used to treat certain types of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, atrio-ventricular block, and one hereditary type of long QT syndrome (LQTS13), attempts to test this prospect have been impeded by the lack of direct-acting and selective IKACh modulators. Recent high-throughput screening efforts have led to the development of a novel family of GIRK channel agonists and antagonists. Using whole-cell electrophysiological approaches, I will evaluate the selectivity, potency, and efficacy profiles of these compounds. Those exhibiting superior pharmacodynamic characteristics, including selectivity for IKACh relative to neuronal GIRK channels, will be further evaluated in the isolated heart preparation, exploiting established genetic and pharmacologic arrhythmia models. Successful completion of the proposed project will shed new light on the mechanisms and relevance of parasympathetic regulation of the heart, and will yield critical preclinical insights required to assess the potential efficacy associated with manipulation of a key parasympathetic effector (IKACh) in the context of cardiac rhythm disorders."

"9437279","Project Summary/Abstract  Almost one fifth of the adult population in the United States is afflicted with fear-related disorders, including diagnoses such as generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, and PTSD. Yet, despite significant advances in research regarding fear reduction, treatments for these disorders are only moderately effective. Therefore, building our understanding of how to reduce harmful fears is of paramount importance. One step in this process is to further explore the safety signal category. Current views hold that all safety signals are harmful in the context of fear reduction, such that their presence prevents fear extinction from occurring. However, recent findings indicate that certain safety signals?social support figures?may enhance, not prevent, fear extinction. Thus, the proposed research seeks to investigate the as-yet unexplored mechanism by which social support has the unique ability to enhance fear extinction, paving the way for future research investigating whether social support can enhance treatment outcomes for fear-related disorders.  Given the important role of the opioid system in both supporting the negative feedback model of fear learning and reinforcing and maintaining social relationships, it is possible that by triggering the release of endogenous opioids, social support disrupts the typical function of the neurobiological associative circuit that that regulates fear learning. This associative circuit relies on opioid processes for fear extinction to occur, such that if opioid processes are blocked, fear extinction is prevented, or if opioid processes are augmented by the presence of a concurrent excitor (an additional fearful stimulus which increases fear and consequent opioid release), fear extinction is enhanced. Thus, unlike learned safety signals, which inhibit opioid processes and prevent fear extinction, social support stimuli might have the unique effect of increasing opioid release without increasing fear, ultimately enhancing fear extinction. This work will seek to more closely examine this mechanism by 1) distinguishing social support stimuli from typical, learned safety signals and determining whether social support stimuli perform the same functions as concurrent excitors but without increasing fear and 2) examining whether opioid processes underlie these effects. In the first study, we will examine whether healthy, adult participants (n=30, 15 females) undergo greater fear extinction when extinction procedures are conducted in the presence of social support stimuli or concurrent excitors compared to in the presence of learned safety signals. In the second study, we will examine whether these effects are still present in healthy, adult participants who are administered placebo (n=30, 15 females) vs. naltrexone (an opioid antagonist known to cross the blood brain barrier and block central opioid processes; n=30, 15 females). Together, the proposed studies will illuminate the mechanism whereby social support enhances fear extinction and may have the potential to shed light on simple, inexpensive ways to enhance current treatments for fear-related disorders."
"9444305","Project 1: The Neural Basis of Muscle Action Loops Abstract The goal of Project 1 is to identify neural mechanisms of sensorimotor processing within low-level muscle action loops that control walking and flight behavior. Acting at the interface between the nervous system and the body, muscle action loops face a daunting set of demands: they must operate with both speed and precision, while retaining the flexibility and robustness necessary to function in diverse, unpredictable environments. To understand how motor control circuits balance these demands to control adaptive behavior, we will combine cell-type specific genetic tools with electrophysiology, functional imaging, and behavioral analysis in the fly. We will first investigate how activity within diverse populations of motor neurons interacts to produce muscle contraction and complex body movements. We will then ask how proprioceptive feedback signals are integrated with ongoing motor commands to adapt and refine behavioral output. Finally, we will work to understand how low-level muscle action loops interact with descending neuromodulatory signals to generate patterned motor activity. These experimental and theoretical efforts are divided into the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Investigate how motor neurons robustly control body movement. Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of proprioceptive feedback in fine-tuning precise motor output. Specific Aim 3: Identify origins and mechanisms of sensorimotor neuromodulation that contribute to flexible locomotor behavior."
"9339566","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Motor impairment following ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of disability and reduced quality of life for our veterans and the general population. Physical therapy (PT) has been the mainstay of rehabilitation to restore motor function, but there is a clear need to improve and expand rehabilitation strategies. The use of adjunct medication has been extensively studied as one approach to enhance clinical outcomes. However, no drugs are presently established to be effective in enhancing rehabilitation-aided motor recovery. Studies from our lab and others suggest that certain drugs, such as amphetamine, hold such promise. Unfortunately, negative cardiovascular side effects associated with amphetamine have hindered its clinical application in stroke rehabilitation. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the rehabilitative potential of drugs will aid in the development of more effective, safer therapies. To this end the ability of amphetamine to enhance basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) signaling in the brain may be one such mechanism. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that upregulation of FGF2 in the brain can significantly enhance motor recovery following ischemic stroke by facilitating neurite outgrowth from spared motor pathways through fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1)-related mechanisms. In aim I we will demonstrate that direct upregulation of FGF2 through intranasal application of plasmid DNA encoding FGF2 enhances motor recovery following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The importance of pairing treatment with physical therapy and the effects of delaying treatment on motor performance will also be assessed. Anterograde and retrograde tract tracing techniques will be used to ascertain the extent to which the unlesioned motor cortex sends new neuronal projections to once-denervated motor regions (i.e. the red nucleus). Biochemical studies will assess changes in transgene and native FGF2 expression and FGFR-related signaling implicated in neurite outgrowth. In Aim II we will extend our previously published work and determine the role of FGFR1 in mediating amphetamine-enhanced motor recovery and neural plasticity (i.e. neurite outgrowth) following permanent MCAO in rats. Two complementary approaches will be employed. A pharmacological approach will use the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ponatinib, to globally inhibit FGFR signaling in the brain. A genetic approach will use a recombinant adeno-associated viral construct encoding for shRNA to FGFR1 to more specifically knock down FGFR1 in the unlesioned motor cortex, which we have previously established to be the site of new neuronal efferents. Aim III will follow the same intervention design as Aim II except the importance of FGFR signaling in mediating enhanced motor improvement and neurite outgrowth induced by plasmid-mediated upregulation of FGF2, as established in Aim I, will be tested. Taken together, the findings of this proposal will provide the framework for future mechanistic and translational studies to optimize rehabilitation paradigms for improved functional recovery following stroke."
"9301184","Project Summary/Abstract The continuous remodeling of actin cytoskeleton, which is regulated through interactions with actin binding proteins, is vital to many cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance, migration of healthy and metastatic cells, neuronal development, synaptic plasticity etc. The main goal of this proposal is to gain insights into mechanisms of cellular actin disassembly, which are less understood than actin assembly. Actin severing by ADF/cofilins alone cannot fully account for cellular disassembly and it is assisted by other actin interacting proteins. Cofilin is implicated in cell invasion during metastasis and understanding its regulation by other proteins may broaden the range of potential therapeutic targets. In addition to general actin disassembly mechanisms, our group has long standing interests in understanding how actin remodeling is regulated in neuronal cells. Recently, we discovered that multidomain cytosolic oxidation-reduction enzyme (Mical) synergizes with cofilin to disassemble actin in axonal growth cones leading to their collapse. This is critical for neuronal pathfinding and regeneration after injury. Also poorly understood is actin remodeling in dendritic spines (DS) - actin rich dendritic protrusions, which are involved in synaptic transmission and undergo activity- dependent enlargement and shrinkage. DS are highly enriched in actin-stabilizing protein drebrin A, which affects actin assembly and disassembly rates. How is drebrin integrated with other actin regulators in DS, including formins and Arp2/3, is unknown. Our goal is to advance this knowledge. A decrease in drebrin's level in patients with neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, epilepsy) makes it a potential therapeutic target, increasing the interest in its function. The work proposed in Aim 1 brings together many approaches - including cryo-electron microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging, mutational work, chemical cross-linking, etc., - to gain structural understanding of the mechanism of cofilin-mediated actin disassembly and its potentiation by assisting factors (coronin and Aip1). The work proposed in Aim 2 will explore in depth a previously unknown mechanism of F-actin disassembly, the just discovered partnership of human cofilin 1 with Mical. This work combines cellular, genetic, and biochemical and structural approaches to provide mechanistic understanding of how stereo-selective oxidation by Mical of two methionine groups on actin primes it for cofilin's action, which has widespread physiological and pathological implications. Our interest in understanding neuronal actin remodeling brings the goal - in Aim 3 - of achieving mechanistic understanding of actin severing by Inverted Formin 2 (INF2), a unique formin family protein capable of both actin filaments assembly and disassembly. We identified INF2 as a potential drebrin-interacting partner, but it is also known to orchestrate mitochondrial fission and its mutations are implicated in degenerative kidney disease and peripheral neuropathy. The work proposed in Aim 4 will clarify how actin remodeling in DS occurs in a background of high concentrations of neuronal actin-binding protein drebrin A."
"9507404","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New strategies which improve the efficacy of radiation therapy and/or protect surrounding normal tissue from damage can have a major impact on treatment outcome. Recent studies have reinvigorated the hypothesis that the outcome of radiation therapy is dependent upon the anti-tumor immune response and strongly support the testing of new combinations of ionizing radiation with immunotherapy. Heat shock protein (HSP) biology has been central to our research for many years. This work led to a completely new vaccine paradigm based upon the chaperone potential of large HSPs (first discovered by our group) and their ability to stimulate powerful anti-tumor immunity. Large HSPs, including hsp110 and the glucose regulated protein 170 (grp170) are related molecular chaperones that are highly efficient in binding to large substrate proteins. Our team has demonstrated that clinically relevant tumor antigens (e.g., gp100, HER- 2/neu, etc.) can be complexed to these large stress-response proteins by heat shock generating a highly effective antigen-specific, immune response. In a significant demonstration of lab bench-to-bedside research, our preclinical results led to a successful RAID application from the NCI for the development of a novel hsp110-based vaccine now undergoing Phase I evaluation in advanced melanoma patients. In new preliminary and published data, we have discovered that grp170 and pathogen-associated molecules (PAMPs) can act synergistically to stimulate the innate immune response and this is dependent on the chaperoning activity of grp170. We believe that this discovery can result in a novel, multipronged approach to cancer therapy. Therefore, we have engineered a chimeric chaperone, termed Flagrp170, by fusing a truncated grp170 chaperone with bacterial flagellin-derived PAMP which has an NF-kB-activating domain. Since preliminary data show a strong potential for Flagrp170 to provide a radioprotective effect, we hypothesize that this novel agent could both enhance therapeutic responsiveness to ionizing radiation (through enhanced immune responses of the vaccine) and provide critical protection of normal tissue. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we predict that this chaperoning competent chimeric macromolecule can preferentially deliver selected antigens to specialized antigen-presenting cells and concurrently stimulate the NF-kB signaling for their functional activation. In Aim 2, we will test whether vaccination with Flagrp170 complexed with tumor antigen will generate a more potent and durable immune response than unmodified grp170. In Aim 3, the potential of using Flagrp170 to improve efficacy of ionizing radiation and provide tissue protection against radio-toxicity will be investigated. Successful completion of proposed research will not only provide a better understanding of the multifunctional features of the chimeric chaperone, but will also establish a scientific rationale for design the new generation of HSP-based vaccines to be used alone or in conjunction with the standard-of-care therapies (e.g., radiotherapy) in future clinical trials."
"9444307","Project 3: The Neural Basis of Motion Guidance Loops Abstract The goal of Project 3 is to characterize the third level of four nested control loops, namely the Neural Basis of Motion Guidance. Motion guidance loops operate at the intersection of sensory and motor circuits to initiate and coordinate goal-directed behaviors. This project will dissect the circuits that control visually guided flight, that relay signals from motor centers into the visual periphery, and that underlie context-dependent switching of visual responses. To do this, the project will make use of genetic driver lines to target specific neuron types, as well as genetic effector molecules that alter neural activity and calcium dynamics. Functional outputs of the system will be measured using calcium and voltage imaging, as well as whole-cell electrophysiological recordings of neural activity, and behavior. Computational modeling will play central roles in both the design of visual stimuli, as well as in studies of network architecture and behavior. These efforts are divided into the following three Aims. Specific Aim 1: Determine the cellular basis of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback in the flight motor system. Specific Aim 2: Determine how motor commands and hunger affect visual processing. Specific Aim 3: Investigate the mechanisms by which odor cues can switch the direction of visual orienting reflexes."

"9449732","PROJECT SUMMARY Cutaneous wound healing is a complex process that involves several physiological and molecular changes surrounding the damaged skin tissue. Environmental contaminants that impede wound healing place individuals at risk for infection and suffering. Steroid hormones, and estrogen in particular, positively influence cellular and tissue processes involved in wound healing, leading to changes in skin structure and physiology and increased shifts in the rate and capacity for wounds to close and heal, but contaminants that interfere with estrogen signaling may impede healing. Inorganic arsenic is an environmental contaminant that interferes with estrogen signaling processes. While there are several potential routes for human exposure to arsenic, in many parts of the world water resources provide a significant exposure route. This risk is real for many Native Americans living in tribal communities where challenges to accessing drinking water with arsenic levels meeting current USEPA standards exist. Health effects resulting from high arsenic exposure are well documented, but recent studies find that even moderate levels of arsenic exposure, such as those identified in some Southwestern Native American communities, are associated with negative health-related outcomes. Much of this exposure is not removed through current water treatment processes on Native lands. Given that Native Americans are at particularly high risk of diabetes and, therefore, diabetes-related wounds determining whether hormonal therapies can improve wound outcomes has the potential to provide translational outcomes useful both to this vulnerable population, and to others experiencing wounds in arsenic contaminated regions globally. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that environmentally relevant levels of arsenic will act to inhibit wound healing processes as well as steroid signaling processes. Furthermore, exogenous administration of estradiol will reverse the effects of arsenic exposure. Aim 1 determines the full dose response of arsenic on an in vitro model for cutaneous wound healing, Aim 2 determines whether estrogen exposure reverses the effects of arsenic exposure using the same in vitro model, and Aim 3 determines not only whether an in vivo model of wound healing validates the results found in the in vitro aims, but also determines whether estrogen treatment in a pre-clinical model supports the use of topical hormone therapy on wounds for individuals exposed to arsenic in their food and water resources. !"
"9516048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results from our ongoing NIDCD-funded study in Tanzania in show that the main auditory problems in HIV+ adults and children are in the central nervous system. These deficits likely develop for the same reasons as HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) (i.e. due to effects on central nervous system pathways). These data also suggest that audiological tests of central auditory processing may be useful tools to study and track the effects of HIV infection and HIV treatment on the central nervous system. But, no data exist that correlate the results of audiological tests of central auditory processes and standard measures of cognitive function. Also, it is not known if these tests would be more sensitive or provide earlier detection of neurological complications than existing tests. Since these audiological tests are often well-standardized and easy to perform, they may offer improved ways to detect neurological dysfunction in HIV+ patients. The objective of the proposed study is to assess central auditory processing (e.g. gap detection thresholds, speech-in-noise thresholds, staggered spondaic word test results, and complex auditory brainstem response) in an established, well-studied, cohort of HIV+ and HIV- adults and children at the Infectious Disease Center in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The results from the auditory tests will be correlated with results from cognitive testing (T.O.V.A. and Cogstate batteries) as well as inflammatory marker levels (IL-6, sCD14), and followed over time. The combination of the audiological testing protocol with neurocognitive test results and inflammatory marker levels--all followed longitudinally--will provide a powerful combination to assess the appearance and progression of central neurological complications over time.  Our study will use a laptop-based hearing testing system that includes: native-language questionnaire administration to assess self-reported hearing capability and exposure to noise, drugs and toxins; threshold audiometry to assess overall hearing ability; adaptive gap detection testing to measure temporal processing; speech-in-noise testing in Kiswahili to assess speech perception; tympanometry to determine middle ear status; staggered spondaic word testing in Kiswahili to assess binaural speech processing. Complex auditory brainstem response measures to assess auditory processing will be done with a dedicated commercial evoked potential system (Smart-EP).  HIV- and HIV+ adults and children will be enrolled, and studied longitudinally with both a central-auditory- processing-focused protocol and tests of neurocognitive function using the T.O.V.A. and Cogstate test battery. Plasma will be collected for analysis for sCD14 and IL-6. The combination of the hearing testing systems with the research-experienced, high-volume clinic in Tanzania, will provide an excellent environment to confirm and expand knowledge about the central auditory processing deficits in HIV infection, and ascertain how these findings are related to neurocognitive findings and inflammation."
"9418920","The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT- CHD) unites the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) to advance translational research on the biological mechanisms of cancer health disparities focusing on biospecimen-based research and precision medicine. It also seeks to establish a joint cancer research education program focused on biobanking and precision medicine education. LSUHSC serves a region characterized by an underserved African-American population, and rampant cancer health disparities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This region has several growing racial/ethnic minority populations. After Hurricane Katrina, the Hispanic population in Louisiana doubled and is now the fastest growing ethnic minority. MCC is located in Tampa, Florida and serves an increasingly wide catchment area characterized by a population diverse in regard to age, race/ethnicity, language and literacy, and is home to an increasing Latino population. Precision medicine research requires: a well-managed, ethnically and racially diverse biospecimen repository; state of the art technology in genomics, epigenomics and ancestry analysis; availability of language, cultural and literacy specific educational tools and resources; and a research education infrastructure that promotes a pipeline of trainees in cancer disparities research. MCC is a national leader and pioneer in these areas, has highly integrated research programs, and seeks to expand the diversity of their biospecimen research endeavors. This partnership is based on two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Plan and execute two collaborative pilot research projects. The first pilot research project focuses on breast cancer genomics, studying biospecimens from Hispanic/Latina patients of mixed genetic ancestry (African, Native American, European) by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and methylation analysis, to study correlations between molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles, clinical outcomes and ancestry. This project will support the career development of racial/ethnic minority early-stage investigators at LSUHSC and MCC. Specific Aim 2: Plan a collaborative three-pronged cancer research education program that includes: 1) a hands-on summer research experience for undergraduate and medical students; 2) delivery of a curriculum to those students focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities; and 3) expansion of outreach education to our respective communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. The combination of these collaborative partnership activities is expected to offer mutual benefit to each institution to impact cancer health disparities, inspire the next generation of researchers, and rapidly lead to the submission of competitive grant applications. Importantly, our main collaborative goal is to bring the benefits of cancer research advancements to underserved communities."
"9396778","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application will foster the development of an independent research career focused on leveraging innovative treatment formats and techniques to target difficult-to-treat and difficult-to-reach child populations. The PI will gain the necessary skills and research training to conduct rigorous clinical evaluations from an experimental therapeutics framework for youth populations that present with unique obstacles to care, such as complex symptom presentations and/or lack of accessibility to quality care.  Selective mutism (SM) is one such complex child disorder that requires specialized care that is not readily available for most youth in need. SM is an anxiety disorder characterized by an inability to speak in certain social situations, despite ability to speak in familiar situations. Despite its low prevalence, SM results in severe impairment in children's social and academic functioning; because most affected children fail to speak in school, they are often insufficiently evaluated for appropriate academic services, and do not get their day-to- day needs met in the classroom. As a low base-rate disorder, expert care for SM is not broadly accessible, and the vast majority of affected children do not receive appropriate services. To address problems of access to quality care for many low base rate disorders, expert providers are increasingly offering intensive treatment options, in which individuals travel from across the world for brief (e.g., 1 week) periods of all-day sessions in treatments not offered, or not offered with similar quality and competency, in the patient's local community. Despite tremendous clinical advances in the development of group intensive behavior therapy formats for the treatment of SM, to date research has not evaluated intensive treatments for SM in a controlled trial.  The project at the center of this NRSA training grant entails a pilot waitlist controlled trial evaluating a one-week group intensive behavior therapy in a diverse population of children SM (N=30) delivered over the summer. Youth will be randomized to either immediate SM intensive group behavior therapy (IGBT), or to a waitlist control (WL). Aim 1 will examine feasibility of and parental satisfaction with the program by examining dropout and daily attendance rates, standardized consumer satisfaction and barriers to treatment participation measures, and costs incurred as a result of participation in the program. Aim 2 will examine reductions in SM symptoms (as well as overall anxiety and functioning) across the two conditions after one week and potential predictors of treatment response. Aim 3 will examine maintenance of treatment response by evaluating whether or not the intensive group treatment program improves children's SM symptoms (as well as overall anxiety and academic functioning) across the two groups in the classroom 8 weeks into the following school year. Finally exploratory Aim 4 will examine individual differences in treatment response related to cultural and sociodemographic factors."
"9332676","Project Summary: In the treatment of cancer, fertility-sacrificing chemotherapy and radiation are commonly used treatment regimens. This is particularly alarming for prepubertal males for whom fertility preservation is not offered. Sperm banking is the only current procedure for male fertility preservation; however, this technique does not cover prepubertal males, who have no sperm to collect. This clinical gap must be addressed by basic science discoveries into in vitro spermatogenesis and testis modeling. Proper compartmentalization of testis cell types into seminiferous tubules and interstitial spaces is necessary for spermatogenesis. In addition, tubule formation coincides with endothelial cell migration into the developing testis, without which there is no tubulogenesis. In vivo techniques have successfully restored spermatogenesis through spermatogonial stem cell transplantation, and testis cell subcutaneous transplantation, which recapitulates de novo tubulogenesis. In vitro techniques using collagen hydrogels as an artificial extracellular matrix (ECM), and air-liquid interface culture have also created de novo testis tubules from aggregated testis cells. However, challenges remain with these methods; namely a low yield of tubules containing meiotic germ cells, a lack of post-meiosis germ cell differentiation, and an understudied endocrine capacity of interstitial Leydig cells. Moreover, to my knowledge, there have been no published studies directly comparing different ECMs for testis modeling, nor incorporating a functional vasculature. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that ECM-based cues and vascular signals are necessary for optimal in vitro testis compartmentalization, germ cell expansion and differentiation, and interstitial cell endocrine function. In my preliminary studies, I have characterized and decellularized mouse and human testis ECM, which is the predicate for my work proposed in aim 1. Additionally, I have preliminary studies creating biomimetic environments that support endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which is the predicate for my work in aim 2. In aim 1, I propose to directly compare the efficacy for in vitro testis culture of different hydrogels (more versus less similar to native testis ECM). Success in modeling will be determined via the collection of four data types: (1) germ cell proliferation and differentiation, (2) tubule formation, (3) endocrine function and responsiveness to hormonal stimulation, and (4) germ cell fertilization leading to live birth of pups. In aim 2, I will elucidate the role of vasculature signaling in testis modeling through the co-culture of testis cells with endothelial cells in novel microfluidic systems that reliably produce angiogenesis. The combination of these hydrogel and microfluidic culture techniques will test my overall hypothesis, while additionally creating an in vitro model for testis development and spermatogenesis. Taken together, these basic science discoveries will inform future clinical practice and provide foundational knowledge for the development of assisted reproductive technologies for prepubertal male cancer patients."

"9453365","Project Summary/Abstract This project is concerned with understanding mechanisms of context-associated fear (CFC) and fear extinction (CFE) memory consolidation during REM sleep. Memory consolidation is a process whereby a recent experience transforms into stable, long-term memories. A large number of studies in both animals and humans have shown that REM sleep and REM sleep-associated physiological signs facilitate consolidation of many different categories of memories, including emotional memory. Deficits in emotional memory consolidation have been associated with impaired regulation of REM sleep signs in a number of neuro-psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and anxiety disorders. Despite the major impact of REM sleep-associated physiological signs on memory consolidation, remarkably little is known about the cellular, molecular and/or network mechanisms underlying REM sleep-associated emotional memory processing. Recent work in the PI's lab has focused on a prominent physiological sign of REM sleep - phasic pontine-wave (P-wave) - that is ideally suited to promote memory consolidation and neuronal plasticity during REM sleep. The central hypotheses are that after training: 1) excitation of the phasic P-wave generator (SubCD) during REM sleep is critical for the consolidation of memory, and 2) activation of the P-wave generator requires activating inputs from the PPT cholinergic cells to the SubCD. Three specific aims have been designed to systematically test these hypotheses: 1. Identify the mechanism responsible for the activation of the P-wave generator following CFC and CFE training. 2. Determine if the activation of the P-wave generator is sufficient for REM sleep- associated consolidation of CFC and CFE memory. Additional experiments will determine whether inactivation of the P-wave generator impairs memory consolidation, even in the presence of sufficient REM sleep. 3. Determine that the activation of the P-wave generator is a causal factor for CFC memory consolidation through amygdala-hippocampal theta synchronization and BDNF and Arc gene expressions in the dorsal hippocampus (DH). The experiments will involve adult male and female rats as subjects. Context-associated fear and fear extinction learning in the rats have proven to be an excellent model to study mechanisms of emotional memory in human. Molecular techniques will be used to block localized BDNF synthesis and neuronal activity, and dual viral DREADD as well as excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs will be used to manipulate activities of P-wave generating neuronal network and P-wave activity. Recordings of neck muscle EMG and EEG activities from frontal cortex, hippocampus, and pons will be used to identify sleep-wake stages. Local field potentials (LFP) will be recorded from the DH, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and pons to analyze amygdala-hippocampal theta wave synchronization. We believe that the results of these studies will extend the leading edge of knowledge on the basic neurobiological mechanisms of sleep-dependent emotional memory processing, which will facilitate vital advancement in the areas of cognitive neuroscience and sleep functionality."
"9347778","The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of an inherently broad- spectrum antimicrobial tissue scaffolding matrix capable of eliminating infecting bacterial pathogens, and improve wound closure in diabetics. Delayed non-healing diabetic wound is responsible for about 100,000 annual non-traumatic lower-limb amputations in the US. Microbial infections further complicate the wound and it has been suggested that pathogenic biofilms play a major role in the prevention of wound healing. The presence of biofilms and the emergence of multi drug resistant organisms (MDROs) have made the current topical and systemic antibiotics becoming progressively less effective to combat diabetic wound infections. While prevention and elimination of pathogens from a diabetic wound is crucial, it is equally important to promote the wound closure by tissue regeneration to reduce the chance of further wound infection. Unfortunately, current products all show limited efficacy in these aspects. G4db, the proposed product overcomes current limitations by both (i) preventing/eliminating infection through a unique mechanism of action that is broad spectrum antibacterial, and (ii) promoting tissue regeneration by providing cell attachment sites within the scaffolding matrix. Unlike any of the products currently used in the clinics, G4db does not rely on using any externally added antibiotics, but rather takes advantage of charge composition to exert toxicity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (including antibiotic resistant strains). Furthermore, G4db relies only on sequences for antimicrobial charge ratio, and therefore is cell friendly, non-inflammatory and nontoxic with a structure and pore size very similar to the native extracellular matrix (ECM). To establish feasibility for the treatment of diabetic wound infections, we propose the following two main tasks: Specific Aim 1) Therapeutic in vivo efficacy of G4db to eliminate infection. Demonstrate the in vivo feasibility of G4db as an antimicrobial that prevents colonization of P. aeruginosa, a common pathogen associated with wound infections. Specific Aim 2) G4db tissue scaffolding matrix accelerates tissue regeneration. Demonstrate in vivo efficacy of G4db as tissue scaffolding matrix that promotes tissue regeneration in full-thickness dorsal excisional wounds in a diabetic swine model. It is expected that the generated data will provide the necessary information to move the proposed product into commercialization. In SBIR Phase II, we will validate the hydrogel in an infected wound healing swine model, establish GMP manufacturing, and execute GLP studies in preparation for our FDA submission."
"9422457","TP63 is a transcription factor required for the normal development and homeostasis of the skin. Missense mutations in the TP63 gene are linked to a subset of severe developmental disorders, termed ectodermal dysplasias. Our application focuses on two of these, ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia and clefting (AEC) and ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia and clefting (EEC), as they are each associated with severe skin erosions. Although EEC has historically not been associated with skin abnormalities, they do occur in a subset of patients (we refer to these patients as EEC/S patients). It is currently not clear how TP63-AEC or TP63-EEC/S mutations lead to the observed skin defects, specifically abnormalities in keratinocyte differentiation, cell- cell adhesion, and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. While a few deregulated genes associated with AEC have been described, essentially nothing is known regarding the disease mechanism underlying EEC/S. The main goal of this application is to elucidate the cellular and molecular defects underlying AEC and EEC/S and to expand our understanding of the role of TP63 in normal keratinocyte biology. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that desmosomal adhesion and hemidesmosomal adhesion are impaired in AEC and EEC/S patient skin, leading to the observed skin fragility. Further, our results suggest that impaired desmosomal signaling contributes to epidermal differentiation defects in patient skin. The current proposal will establish mechanistic insights into the molecular pathology underlying skin fragility in TP63-related ectodermal dypslasias. Further, we will gain new insights into the epidermal function of TP63, which will broaden our understanding of skin biology in general."
"9436677","In all animals, large-scale zygotic transcription typically initiates several cell cycles following fertilization at the maternal-zygotic transition (MZT). Prior to wholesale zygotic transcription initiation, the embryo depends on maternal factors in the egg to drive its early development. Hence, eggs are endowed with a multitude of factors critical for fertilization, egg activation, early cell cycles, and other processes acting prior to zygotic genome activation. Although essential to reproduction, these pre-MZT processes have been little studied. A unique collection of maternal-effect mutants in the zebrafish with pre-MZT defects will be investigated here and are expected to reveal new molecular players in these processes. Because the egg supplies all the factors needed by the embryo for its early development, eggs are very large. Little is known about how the enormous cytoplasm of these large embryonic cells, full of components needed for several cell divisions, is restricted in its assembly of the stored components to each ensuing cell division. Two maternal-effect mutant genes that restrict cytoskeletal assembly in the egg will be studied and the molecular nature of the genes determined. These are expected to be novel repressors of cytoskeletal assembly that function specifically in the egg to regulate the maternal supply of these factors. Several additional maternal mutant genes that affect specific aspects of egg activation and the initiation of cell cycles will also be studied. Based on the chromosomal locations of the mutant genes, novel genes or previously known genes with new, unexpected functions are expected to be identified. The molecular identity of the genes will be determined through an RNA-Seq approach, followed by CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to verify the identities of the genes. Future studies will then integrate these new factors into the known molecular framework for each particular maternally controlled process, which is expected to fill gaps and/or generate new molecular entry points for future investigation."

Fifteen years ago, a strategic decision was made to promote basic science research in tumor immunology and establish an infrastructure to facilitate clinical translation of cancer immunotherapies at SCC through the creation of a Tumor Immunology Program (TIP) as an integral component of a newly-forming NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. This strategic decision has proved to be prescient, and today the number of laboratories at SCC performing tumor immunology-related research has increased significantly. Of particular note, in the last five years there has been an increase in the number of laboratories performing translational tumor immunology research and a number of investigator-initiated cancer clinical trials are ongoing. Importantly, this increase in translational research has been achieved through the creation of an environment where interactions between basic scientists and physician scientists occur easily and often and where state-of-the-art resources are available to facilitate translation of basic science research findings into novel therapeutic opportunities. Thus, as a result of the environment that was established by the Siteman Cancer Center, the highly interactive nature of the basic immunology research community now extends to the work being performed in the areas of tumor immunology and cancer immunotherapy. Efforts of Tumor Immunology Program members are currently focused into four central themes: (1) the dynamic interplay between the immune system and cancer, (2) the molecular basis of immune recognition of cancer, (3) the impact of inflammation and immunosuppression on cancer development and (4) cancer immunotherapy. The Tumor Immunology Program has 34 members from 5 departments and 1 school at Washington University. The program is supported by $15.8 million in funding, of which $3.3 million is from NCI and $8.4 million is other peer-reviewed funding. In the last grant period, members of the program published 602 manuscripts, of which 24% represent inter-programmatic and 15% resulted from intra-programmatic collaborations. During the last funding period, TIP had 682 total enrollments onto 45 clinical studies: 67% were therapeutic, and 27% were early phase. Accrual to investigator-initiated trials was 30%."
"9419237","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Research Education Core (REC) of the Partnership between Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU, formerly known as PSM) and the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) has built an educational pipeline designed to address several identified barriers which are known to contribute towards cancer health disparities within the Hispanic/Latino (H/L) population and, particularly within Puerto Rico (PR). These include a scarcity of H/L cancer researchers, cancer diagnoses at a more advanced-stage, reduced access to cancer care, underrepresentation in clinical cancer trials, and limited awareness of cancer research and cancer control within the local population. The overall objective of the REC of the PSM-MCC Partnership is to increase the number and quality of basic science investigators and clinical research scientists focused on precision and preventative cancer medicine research for the PR population. Our core tangibly improved and achieved the benchmarks established in our previous cycle of funding. Under the next cycle we propose to refine our ongoing activities taking into consideration those endeavors that worked well while modifying those that were less successful. We will provide rigorous and structured student education at both institutions, with a comprehensive network of faculty research hosts/advisors and peers for career guidance and development. To achieve our goals participants will be recruited at multiple career levels: PHSU graduate and medical students; MCC graduate and medical students; and PR residents and fellows. The specific measurable objectives of the REC are as follows: (1) Provide education in research methods with specific experiences to enhance cancer research focused on the Puerto Rican and H/L populations; (2) Enhance research education in health disparities at MCC and provide additional opportunities for PR post-doctoral fellows, and (3) Support the careers of medical fellows and residents to enhance the cancer clinical research capacity in PR and treatment of the PR population. Successful outcomes from these goals will expand the numbers and achievements of Puerto Rican cancer investigators, address Hispanic health disparities on the Island, contribute to a long-term cancer research education infrastructure at PHSU, and augment cancer research aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the Hispanic population in both PR and Florida. The REC will complement and leverage the existing programs at both MCC and PHSU to significantly enhance the overall Partnership objectives by providing a better trained workforce to conduct cancer related research with the momentum to create new research initiatives addressing the health disparities found in Hispanic populations."
"9285277","Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells. They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-?B pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface."
"9408953","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The skeleton is the third most common site of metastatic cancer, and nearly half of all cancers metastasize to bone. As a result of new and aggressive treatments cancer patients are living longer, but at sites of skeletal metastasis fractures occur in 17%-35% of affected bones after minimal trauma. This significantly impacts patient functioning and quality of life. While much has been learned about the mechanisms of skeletal metastasis, clinicians continue to make subjective assessments regarding a patient's fracture risk. We have developed a method, called Computed Tomography-based Rigidity Analysis (CTRA), to use computed tomography (CT) images to calculate the minimal rigidity of a bone containing a neoplastic lesion for the purposes of estimating load capacity and predicting pathologic fractures. The CTRA method has been validated in ex-vivo, pre-clinical, and in-vivo studies. An alpha version of CTRA was developed for research purposes. While it is not intended or marketed for clinical use, it is being used clinically in several different hospitals at the discretion of a medical doctor. Physicians using CTRA have been inconsistently reimbursed by public and private payers under CPT code 76499 ?Unlisted Diagnostic Radiographic Procedure.? This generic code is used when no other specific procedure code exists. At low volumes during initial deployment this is feasible, but for CTRA to become a standard of care, FDA 510(k) clearance and a non-generic Category I CPT code are needed. Through an ongoing Direct Phase II SBIR we are developing a commercial quality CTRA software package that will integrate with hospital picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and fully automate the CTRA process. This CRP grant will help us bridge the gap between product development and successful medical software commercialization. Therefore, the first two aims fall into the category of Technical Assistance, whereas the last two aims fall into the Late Stage R&D categories follows: Aim 1: prepare all required documentation for an FDA 510(k) submission for CTRA software: Aim 2: prepare an application to the American Medical Association (AMA) for a Category I CPT code: Aim 3: software design verification and validation activities: and Aim 4: eliminate the need for an imaging phantom. Given the clinical need and proven accuracy of the approach, the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) supports the commercialization of CTRA and has already committed to assisting us in the process of applying for a CPT code (see MSTS Letter of Support)."
"9186006","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The absence of effective treatment options for patients with brainstem tumors and other highly aggressive, unresponsive CNS tumors emphasizes the need for innovative strategies that combine advanced imaging techniques, minimally invasive delivery methods, and targeted therapeutic agents. Current challenges to successful tumor treatment include the intrinsic chemoresistance of tumor cells and an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), which effectively impedes the delivery of most therapeutic molecules. More specific, tailored therapeutic agents are emerging, however, even the most potent therapeutic molecules identified from in vitro experiments will be ineffective if they cannot penetrate the BBB to reach the cancer cells. The study of drug distribution, therefore, is crucial to determining a drug's efficacy. Otherwise, potential drugs will be regarded as ineffective, while they are in fact being inadequately delivered to the tumor. We have successfully developed a unique MRI-guided neurointerventional platform for predictable, local intra- arterial (IA) delivery of therapeutic agents to the brainstem after focal BBB disruption (BBBD). We are able to precisely document trans-catheter perfusion using real-time GE-EPI MRI and pre-define an area for selective BBBD and subsequent super-selective therapeutic agent administration. While our current methodology utilizes the chemotherapy drug melphalan, this delivery strategy can be applied to a variety of therapeutic agents including other chemotherapy drugs, siRNA, microRNA, aptamers, and future discoveries. In this proposal we will compare the differences in drug distribution after BBBD with and without the aid of predicting the targeted area in advance. We will determine the cellular neurotoxicity after IA BBBD and chemotherapy via the basilar artery, both in terms of severity of injury and time course for development. We will also assess the feasibility of glial progenitor cells (GRPs) engraftment to determine their role in repair afte chemotherapy. This information can be readily translated into our ongoing Phase I trial, Intra-arterial Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Progressive DIPG, (NCT01688401). We have assembled a team of basic science and clinical experts across the disciplines of pediatric neuro-oncology, interventional neuroradiology, and MRI research for this project. While our proposal is generally targeted for brainstem pathologies, this MRI-guided neurointerventional platform can be applied to various other CNS tumors and neurovascular pathologies that require selective, targeted therapeutic delivery."
"9314539","This Project, synergistic with Project 1, will evaluate the association between the gut microbiota and obesity and its associated metabolic phenotypes. Background: In work by Project 1, when fecal microbiota from obese (Ob) and lean (Ln) twins from discordant pairs (not metabolically phenotyped) were transplanted to germ-free mice, Ob microbiota transmitted increased adiposity and metabolic features that accompany human insulin- resistant states (e.g., increased circulating levels of serum branched-chain amino acids). In addition, co- housing mice harboring Ob co-twin microbiota with mice containing transplanted Ln microbiota prevented development of these body composition and metabolic phenotypes in the Ob cagemate: prevention was associated with unidirectional invasion of bacterial taxa from the Ln to the Ob cagemate's gut community, indicative of unfilled niches in Ob microbiota that could be occupied, but only under certain dietary contexts (observed under a low saturated fat/high fruit & vegetable [LoSF-HiFV) diet, but not under a HiSF-LoFV diet). Results were consistent with previous findings of reduced diversity in the microbiota of Ob individuals and suggest that fecal transplants from discordant twin pairs to gnotobiotic mice could help guide development of therapeutic strategies (microbial or diet-based) for restoration of the gut microbiota of the microbiota donor population to a pre-obese or metabolically healthy state. Approach: To better define the contributions of the microbiota to obesity and its associated metabolic dysfunctions, and to advance development of microbiota- directed interventions for treatment or prevention, we will identify, from a large panel of young adult female dizygotic twin pairs, three informative groups: pairs dually discordant for obesity and metabolically healthy/unhealthy (MH/MUN: indexed by hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp [HEC]), pairs singly discordant for obesity, and pairs singly discordant for metabolic health (LnMH/ObMUN, LnMH/ObMH and ObMH/ObMUN pairs, Ln=BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, Ob=BMI 30-44.9). Pairs will undergo HEC and body-composition analyses to quantify insulin-resistance and confirm group assignment. Pairs will provide fecal, urine and blood (serum) samples under free diet (1 week), with daily recording of diet intake, then complete an in-home cross-over controlled diet study, eating in random order a controlled HiSF-LoFV diet (2 weeks), and a controlled more healthy diet (LoSF-HiFV, 2 weeks), with continuing provision of fecal, urine, and end-of-diet blood samples. Human-to- mouse fecal transplant experiments (Project 1), using donor feces collected under LoSF-HiFV versus HiSF- LoFV diet conditions, will be used to characterize transmissibility of donor phenotypes, their sensitivity to diet and the degree of prevention of transmitted ObMUN and ObMH phenotypes achievable with co-housing with Ln mice (as a function of bacterial invasion pattern and diet type). Metabolomic analyses (Core A) will be used to test whether metabolic phenotypes observed in mice fed diets similar in composition to the human diets, represent those present in the humans. Increased recruitment of twin pairs will ensure adequate power."
"9452318","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Arachidonic acid, a long-chain ?-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), has been demonstrated to affect carcinogenesis in animal and in vitro studies. The effect of arachidonic acid is believed to be largely due to overproduction of the eicosanoid, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The other class of PUFAs, ?-3, also bind to the same enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism; however, the resulting set of eicosanoids are anti- inflammatory. Thus, ?-3 PUFA metabolism could indirectly inhibit PGE2 production and reduce cancer risk. Over the past few years, multiple genetic variants have been identified to be associated with PUFAs. The goal of the proposed K99/R00 award is to elucidate the potential causal association between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal tumor risk using Mendelian randomization (MR), an approach that may avoid potential pitfalls of conventional observational epidemiologic research. Using fine-mapping, the proposed study will identify additional variants in key loci (11q12.2 and 6p24.2) that are involved in the conversion from short- to long- chain PUFAs to improve the PUFA genetic instruments. The proposed study will utilize individual-level data from the ColoRectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) consortium; blood and tissue samples from the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study (TCPS); and genotype and phenotype information from Vanderbilt University's de-identified electronic medical record DNA bio-repository (BioVU). Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) to conduct a MR study for the association between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal cancer risk; (2) to conduct fine-mapping to identify additional variants in key PUFA metabolism loci to improve the genetic instruments for MR; (3) to evaluate potential interactions of genetically predicted long-chain PUFAs (using the improved genetic instrument) and use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with the risk of colorectal tumors; (4) to investigate associations between genetically predicted long-chain PUFAs and selected tumor biomarkers; and (5) to conduct a mediation analysis to determine whether PGE2 is a mediator on the causal pathway between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal adenoma risk. This innovative study will be the first to develop an instrumental variable using a polygenic risk score in order to identify potential causal association between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal cancer tumor risk, and will be cost- efficient. The proposed study will help elucidate associations between long-chain PUFAs and colorectal tumors, which could lead to potential risk reduction strategies. Lastly, the proposed career development award will equip the candidate with the additional didactic and research training necessary for building an independent research program in the areas of nutrition, genetics and molecular epidemiology, and cancer."

"9353851","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the late stages of the virus life cycle, HIV-1 packages two copies of the viral genome into each assembling HIV-1 virus particle. Although this process is critical for production of infectious virus, where and how packaging occurs in cells remains unclear. Because so little is known, it is generally assumed that packaging is initiated when Gag and HIV-1 genomic RNA (gRNA) randomly find each other anywhere in the cytoplasm. In contrast, our findings argue for a very different model, in which gRNA packaging is initiated within a specific subcellular complex through a highly regulated process. Our preliminary data reveal that prior to and during assembly, non-translating gRNA is largely found in cellular complexes termed RNA granules. Moreover, we find that a subclass of RNA granules containing gRNA and Gag can be isolated using an antibody to the cellular ATPase ABCE1. Thus, ABCE1 is a marker for the RNA granules in which packaging takes place. Additionally, we have identified three categories of ABCE1-containing packaging granules: those involved in early, intermediate, and late stages of packaging. Here we will use our ability to isolate RNA granules representing different stages in HIV-1 packaging to define molecular events involved in initiation and completion of gRNA encapsidation. In Aim 1, inducing Jurkat cells to synchronously express latent HIV-1 genomes will allow us to follow the kinetics of gRNA trafficking through each of the packaging granules we have identified and into released virus. We will also confirm the physiological relevance of HIV-1 packaging granules using HIV-1 infected primary human T cells. In Aim 2, we will identify components of HIV-1 packaging granules. This will be done using a hypothesis-driven approach, in which we will test for viral components expected to be present during packaging (e.g. lysyl tRNA primer and a dimeric form of gRNA), and using a discovery- based approach to define the cellular proteome and RNAome of early, intermediate, and late packaging granules. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use innovative crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) technology to understand conformational changes that occur during packaging. Others recently examined all Gag in the cytoplasm vs. at membranes using CLIP and found that the number of Gag-gRNA contact sites increase dramatically during packaging. Here, we propose to use CLIP to determine whether HIV-1 packaging granules are the sites in which Gag proteins make those changing gRNA contacts. We will also use CLIP to identify host proteins that make contact with gRNA and are therefore likely to promote encapsidation. Studies in Aim 3 will also identify host proteins that contact Gag, thereby helping to define conformational changes that Gag undergoes during packaging. Together, the proposed aims will greatly advance our understanding of the molecular basis of packaging in cells, and will provide insight into recently discovered small molecules that inhibit virus-specific RNA granules."
"9561233","Project Summary/Abstract: Molecular Therapeutics (MT)  The goal of the Molecular Therapeutics (MT) Program is to identify therapeutic targets, drugs, and strategies,  and to facilitate the translation of Dartmouth-investigator hypotheses into clinical trials. The research interests  of the program faculty cover the full spectrum of investigations in molecular therapeutics and include synthesis  of novel compounds as research tools and potential therapeutics; investigation of novel targets for therapy;  assessment of predictors of disease progression or drug response; and proof-of-concept and therapeutic early  phase clinical trials. The MT program currently has 30 members from 9 different departments whose research  foci can be described under the following four scientific themes: (1) Synthesis and discovery of novel  compounds and potential cancer drugs, (2) Interrogation of potential new targets and therapeutic strategies, (3)  Development of biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prediction of treatment response, and (4) Development of  hypothesis-based cancer clinical trials. These four research themes do not exist as separate entities. There is  extensive interaction between them, as novel drugs and compounds are used to interrogate novel targets,  novel biomarkers are being identified, and these advances are being translated into molecular proof-of-  principle clinical trials. The interactions across this spectrum are catalyzed by the interactive environment  generated by activities of the MT program, its deep involvement in the Early Phase Trials Clinical Oncology  Group (EPTCOG), and by the continual nurturing and mentoring of program members by the Program Co-  Directors. This work results in extensive collaborations across the entire spectrum of molecular therapeutics,  as evidenced by joint grants and publications. Major contributions of the program to the NCCC mission have  been the facilitation of discoveries promising new therapeutic approaches, the translation of Dartmouth  investigator hypotheses into clinical trials, and the accrual of patients to such studies. In addition, NCCC has  made substantial commitment to improving the depth and breadth of research and clinical translation in the MT  program through support of shared resources, financially supporting many of the costs associated with early-  phase/proof-of-principle clinical trials, and strategic recruitment of new investigators. For example, over the  past 5 years, the membership of the program has evolved with the successful recruitment of outstanding new  faculty in the biological laboratory sciences (Miller, Kurokawa), chemistry (Micalizio, Wu), and in  clinical/translational investigations (Danilov, Lansigan, Smith). More than 363 cancer-related articles have  been published over the reporting period (54 [15%] in high impact journals), many of them representing intra-  program (69=19%) or inter-program (107=29%) collaboration. These collaborations involve 29 MT program  members and 63 NCCC members, almost equally distributed between the other 5 NCCC research programs.  Total funding for the program currently is $8.0M, of which $6.0M is peer-reviewed and $3.4M is from NCI."
"9485458","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder, particularly with respect to disease progression. Thoracic imaging holds promise for characterizing disease heterogeneity but is limited by the inability to resolve emphysema and small airways disease. Small airways disease is the primary site of airflow obstruction in COPD and precedes the development of emphysema. There remains a critical need to non-invasively characterize the pathologic heterogeneity of COPD, particularly at an early stage in order to develop targeted therapies. We recently developed the Parametric Response Map (PRM capable of assessing functional small airways disease (fSAD) and emphysema. Our preliminary data suggest that PRM: a) identifies abnormality even in those without spirometric obstruction; b) fSAD is the predominant lesion in mildly obstructed patients whereas emphysema predominates in more severely obstructed subjects; c) and fSAD precedes the development of CT defined emphysema. We hypothesize that PRM metrics will allow us to non-invasively evaluate the regional structural heterogeneity of airflow obstruction and its relationship to clinically relevant outcomes. To test this hypothesis we plan to leverage two NHLBI cohorts. The first is the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), a 3,200 subject study where a baseline and one-year CT are already included in the protocol linked to extensive clinical and biologic data; this proposal will also fund an additional 200 three-year CT's. The second is COPDGene, a 10,000 subject study with baseline and five year CTs. We will also take advantage of the active lung transplant programs at the University of Michigan and Temple University to obtain explants for this proposal. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) determine whether PRM fSAD precedes the development of emphysema and lung function decline by performing PRM on baseline, 1-year and 3-year CT images; (2) determine the relationship between PRM metrics and clinical outcomes including acute exacerbations of COPD; and (3) determine relationship between the extent of histological abnormality in the small airways and the emphysema with PRM metrics from the same patients. it is our expectation that PRM fSAD will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression and histologically verified small airways disease. Such results could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD and its relationship to important clinical outcomes."
"9447472","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (IDC) Tuskegee University Center for Biomedical Research (CBR) Research Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMI) proposes the Investigator Development Core (IDC) to provide junior-level and transitional investigators at Tuskegee University (TU) with the necessary resources and training to assist them in their move to the status of independent researchers focused on minority health and health disparities. The IDC is intended to support primarily: 1) faculty members who are already in the field of biomedical research but, because of their junior status, require a period of mentored career development in order to become independent scientists in the fields of minority health and health disparities research; 2) Those who have an established career in either a non-biomedical field or a biomedical field in an area not directly linked to minority health but now desire to move into biomedical research or who want to include minority health and health disparities, or the translation of it, in their research. Specifically, the IDC aims to: 1) Provide funding for developmental pilot research projects that demonstrate the potential for becoming independent, fundable R-series or equivalent proposals following their completion; 2) Provide pilot-level funding to traditionally non-biomedical, innovative research approaches that address minority health and health disparities; 3) Provide and coordinate senior-level mentorship and research training and career developmental activities for junior-level investigators who receive funding for Center for Biomedical Research (CBR)/RCMI pilot research projects. To achieve these aims, the IDC will integrate its efforts with the infrastructure core, the community engagement core, our existing extramural collaborative networks and the CBR program evaluation system. The IDC support is expected to advance the professional growth of junior faculty at TU by enhancing their productivity, competitiveness and potential to be established researchers on diseases that disproportionately impact minority populations."

We will realize this vision through three aims: (1) Empower stakeholders in the process of integrating research with healthcare practice and community wellness, (2) Create the workforce of the future, and (3) Optimize efficiency and effectiveness of clinical research. Building on the successes of the last 6 years, we propose innovative changes to existing programs and creation of new programs designed to provide support for high quality cutting-edge research done by teams of scientists. Building on our existing programs, we propose to (1) provide innovative programs in career development for a wide range of learners, (2) develop new pilot programs to support creation of solutions for obstacles to research, (3) expand our community engagement program to extend beyond Greater Cincinnati to stakeholders across the U.S., (4) provide more comprehensive support by biomedical informatics for the services provided by the CCTST, (5) expand support for patient-oriented research, and (6) help overcome regulatory and ethical challenges that impede clinical research in local and multisite studies. We propose innovative efforts directed toward fostering learning health networks and creating a Research Commons to provide more comprehensive support to investigators. We will focus on (1) teaching and implementing team science principles and encouraging collaboration across a variety of disciplines and stakeholders, (2) consolidation of clinical trials support across the academic health center by creating Cinci-HERO to help multicenter trials for which the CCTST affiliates are the leads (including serving as the IRB of record) or site participants and recruitment of populations across the lifespan including underrepresented minorities, those with environmental exposures and health disparities, and (3) acute care research and lifespan data integration that takes advantage of institutional strengths."
"9444239","Project 2 - Quantitative behavioral analysis and imaging - Abstract Behavior is the foundation for systems neuroscience. Its quantitative description and algorithmic analyses need to be the first and essential step on the journey to generating a realistic circuit model of any brain. Whether fly, fish, rat or human, for an animal to exhibit purposeful behavior, it must be endowed with the computational ability to map patterns of sensory input to patterns of motor output. The quantifiable rules of sensory-motor mapping define the algorithms of behavioral strategy. These computational rules determine what the underlying neural circuits are actually doing. The critical test of a nervous system is whether it can provide computational solutions for behavioral challenges that the animal faces in natural environments. As such, it is the behavioral algorithms that dictate the questions and framework for any model of neural implementation and it is therefore necessary to turn behavior into a conceptual framework that can fully integrate genetic, anatomical, and physiological data. In the first part of Project 2, we describe a fleet of behavioral set-ups and assays that allow the quantitative description of fish behavior at various levels of detail and throughput. To perform a neural implementation of these algorithms and generate a realistic whole-brain model for larval zebrafish we need, in addition to knowledge about the anatomical structure of the circuits, detailed information about neural activity patterns during behavior. To that end, we have designed a variety of assays that are compatible with brainwide imaging of neural activity in freely swimming and tethered larval zebrafish. These assays in conjunction with Ca2? + imaging are described in the second part of Project 2. Furthermore, tests for causality and the rigorous validation of circuit models require targeted perturbation experiments, where identified neuronal cell types can be silenced or activated in a targeted way. The tethered behavioral assays described in this project provide the ideal setting to perform such perturbations in the context of a controlled behavioral paradigm. We conclude, in the third part of Project 2, by describing a specific application of these assays that shed light on the role that various modulatory neurotransmitters, such as oxytocin and serotonin, play in regulating internal states involving hunger, stress or loneliness."
"9539322","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are chronic myeloid malignancies characterized by overproduction of myeloid lineage cells. An acquired JAK2V617F mutation, which results in constitutive activation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase, has been found in a majority of patients with MPNs. This has led to the development of JAK2 inhibitors. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of hydroxyurea-resistant PV and advanced MF. Although Ruxolitinib therapy can reduce splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, it failed to produce complete remission in patients with PV/MF. It has become clear that current chemotherapies including JAK2 inhibitors are not sufficient to cure MPNs. So, there is a critical need to develop novel targeted therapies for MPNs. We have found that SHP2 is constitutively phosphorylated/activated in mouse and human MPN cells expressing JAK2V617F. SHP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a positive role in cell signaling. In preliminary studies, we have observed that knockdown of SHP2 significantly inhibits proliferation of cells expressing JAK2V617F. Moreover, deletion of SHP2 inhibits the development of PV and MF in JAK2V617F knock-in mice. Furthermore, treatment with a novel SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 significantly inhibits the growth of JAK2V617F-positive MPN cells. So, we hypothesize that SHP2 may play important roles in hematopoietic transformation/MPNs induced by JAK2V617F, and pharmacologic inhibition of SHP2 might be efficacious against MPNs. To test our hypothesis, we have proposed two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will further define the role of SHP2 in the development and maintenance of PV and MF using floxed SHP2 and conditional JAK2V617F knock-in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the safety and efficacy of a novel SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 against cultured and primary MPN cells and animal models of PV and MF. We will also determine the effects of SHP2 deletion or inhibition on JAK2V617F-evoked signaling and define the mechanism by which SHP2 regulates JAK2V617F-induced transformation/MPNs. Our proposed studies will provide the first demonstration that SHP2 plays an important role in the development of MPNs (PV and MF) and targeting of SHP2 using small molecule inhibitor 11a-1 is a novel strategy in treating MPNs. Moreover, results from these pre-clinical studies will generate the supportive data for Phase I/II clinical trials of SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 in the treatment of MPNs."
"9422520","Project Abstract: The overall objective of this project within the structure of Advancing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging (ARMADA) is to provide a brief, comprehensive, readily available tool for early identification of age-related cognitive decline and dementia. This objective targets the goals of the NIA and the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, namely, to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by 2025. The proposed study also capitalizes on the prior investment by 16 NIH centers and institutes to support the creation of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological Behavior and Function (NIHTB) and its standardization. To achieve our objective, the studies undertaken in this project will serve to validate the NIHTB and its enhancement with new state-of-the-art tests (NIHTB+) in diverse samples of cognitively healthy and impaired individuals over age 65. The NIHTB has been standardized on a general population sample from 3 to 85 years of age but not in clinically diagnosed samples of individuals age 65-85 with cognitive impairment and dementia, nor in cognitively healthy individuals over age 85. Validation will be carried out by nine sites across the US affiliated with NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers (ADCs), making use of existing cohorts of diverse individuals, well-characterized by cognitive status, who have available in vivo biomarkers associated with AD, to recruit participants for ARMADA.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: To validate the NIHTB and added tests (Aim 2, below, NIHTB+) in the trajectory from normal cognitive aging to dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Study groups are race/ethnicity population based samples of: 1) older normal controls aged 65-85 (NCO); 2) amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, single or multi-domain); 3) early stage DAT; and, 4) cognitively normal individuals 86+ years of age, oldest old (NCOO) to extend the NIHTB+ beyond age 85. A fifth group of African American NCO and aMCI will be recruited to validate the NIHTB+ specifically in this under-represented group that may be at increased risk of DAT.

"9352699","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use our immature large animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to accelerate basic science therapeutic discoveries to clinical trials for TBI in children. Because mitochondria play a key role in many primary and secondary pathologic pathways in TBI, we will use cyclosporin A (CsA) to rescue mitochondrial function, reduce cell death and improve neurofunction. Due to its safety profile in humans, pleiotropic effects, and success in multiple preclinical adult rodent TBI models, CsA (CsA) has exciting potential as a therapy for pediatric TBI. Because CsA is also off-patent and already in use in children for other indications, the results of the proposed preclinical therapy development plan can be translated rapidly to clinical trial. We determine the optimal dose of CsA for the spectrum of moderate TBI in the child, using our established immature porcine TBI models: focal lesions from controlled cortical impact and diffuse brain injury from rapid nonimpact head rotation. In addition, we include optimization at 1 hr after TBI to determine dosing strategies in the field, and at 6 hrs after TBI for hospital-based strategies. To enhance translation, we include clinically relevant physiological monitoring and current critical care management strategies. Furthermore, we use both histological and neurofunctional endpoints to identify agents that reduce brain injury acutely, and have sustained cognitive benefits. In Aim 1, we will evaluate short-term dose response using short term terminal outcomes. For each start time and injury type, the most effective and the lowest dose with significant effect will continue to Aim 2. In Aim 2 we test these dosing strategies for efficacy in neurocognitive outcomes, measured 6 days after injury, to identify the optimal dosing strategy to evaluate in pediatric TBI clinical trials. In Aim 3 we will identify sex-specific cognitive recovery and toxicology responses to the optimal dose of CsA. In Aim 4 we design the clinical trial from the porcine data and published human studies, and submit an IND application to the FDA. This state-of-the-art, innovative preclinical study design can be applied to future evaluations of other therapies longer treatment windows, other ages, other brain injuries, and to other agents that promote neurorecovery or repair."
"9413178","The goal of the Methodologic Core is to support high-impact clinical research focusing on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of musculoskeletal diseases. Specifically, the Methodologic Core will provide the contemporary data science infrastructure necessary for studies that leverage electronic medical records (EMR), and for trials that collect patient reported outcomes. We will organize around three major activities: rigorous and novel study designs; secondary use of EMR data for research; and primary data collection and pragmatic clinical trial conduct. In particular, the linkage of multiple EMR systems is opening new opportunities for large-scale clinical research, but also demands new methods for the extraction of reliable information, and for the design of trials that can tailor to the characteristics of patients and health care delivery systems. The University of Washington Center for Biomedical Statistics (CBS) has provided informatics and statistical leadership to multiple observational and randomized studies focusing on musculoskeletal disorders, and is uniquely positioned to provide the foundation for expanded impact within the broad scope of the NIAMS mission."
"9379369","SUMMARY Colorectal cancer (CRC) is consequence of molecular alterations transforming normal epithelial cells into their neoplastic counterparts. Virtually, all CRCs derive from adenomas or serrated polyps, which begin forming in adulthood, and lead to cancer in 6-7% of the U.S. population by 80 years of age. However, since 30-50% or more of the population is affected by colon polyps, it is apparent that the vast majority of these lesions do not progress to CRC, but rather are benign proliferative lesions and not truly premalignant lesions. The molecular mechanisms that dictate which polyps are ?benign proliferative disease? and which are ?premalignant states? are essentially unknown. We propose to use an exceptional and unique clinical resource to determine whether the underlying genetic alteration profile, gene expression status, and/or epigenetic state of an early polyp governs its fate, using in vivo growth rate as a surrogate measure of malignant potential. The exceptional and unique resource that will permit us to do these studies is a large series of human colorectal polyps whose volumetric growth patterns have been serially assessed over time by CT colonography (CTC) prior to resection. In addition, volumetric textural analysis of CTC polyp data, which can be used to distinguish non-neoplastic proliferative lesions (hyperplastic polyps) from adenomas, will be correlated with growth rates. We will correlate results from whole exome sequencing, gene expression studies, and high-density methylation arrays with the observed CTC-based volumetric growth patterns, textural analysis and polyp histology. This ?radiogenomic? analysis of our series of benign and premalignant polyps will then allow us to test an innovative hypothesis about the mechanism(s) that determines a polyp?s fate. We have previously shown that many mutations and epigenetic alterations arise very early in polyp formation (the ?Big Bang? hypothesis of tumorigenesis) rather than sequentially, and that the initial tumor profile governs whether the polyp is premalignant or benign. Thus, some polyps might be ?born to be bad?. In this proposal, we will test the novel hypothesis that the genetic, transcriptional, or epigenetic state established at polyp formation dictates if a polyp is a benign proliferative lesion or a premalignant state. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are: 1. To fully assess CTC data from a large cohort of patients with colorectal polyps that were followed in vivo by serial CTC prior to colonoscopic resection to accurately establish polyp growth rates and texture; 2. To determine whether mutations or transcriptional changes that occur early in tumorigenesis dictate polyp fate; and 3. To determine whether the epigenotype of a polyp correlates with growth behavior and the potential to become a CRC."
"9525331","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of this project is to integrate several demonstrated technologies for restoring lower limb function after paralysis from spinal cord injury (SCI), and examine novel stimulation schemes designed to minimize fatigue of the knee extensor musculature during standing. All existing stimulation systems for standing after SCI rely on continuous activation of the knee extensors, which results in rapid fatigue that limits their functionality and clinical utility. The primary objective of this translational study is to improve the performance of neuroprostheses for standing by developing and implementing advanced stimulation paradigms that exploit the selectivity of multi- contact peripheral nerve electrodes to prolong standing duration.   Strategie for exploiting the selective activation of multiple synergistic muscle fiber populations include alternating between independent groups to reduce stimulus duty cycle, interleaving stimulus pulses to reduce local stimulus frequency, and a previously unexplored paradigm in which the oscillations of sinusoidal forces generated by each population produce a constant net output that exceeds any individual contribution.  There has yet to be a successful critical evaluation of any of these methods chronically in humans, which still require rigorous bench testing. Stable and selective peripheral nerve interfaces (multi-contact spiral cuff electrodes) have recently become available for chronic human implantation and will enable the clinical assessment of advanced stimulation paradigms in individuals with SCI. We will implement each paradigm in recipients of implanted standing neuroprostheses and determine their relative benefits in terms of knee extension moment, endurance, robustness and elapsed standing duration. The numerous parameters that need to be adjusted for each muscle fiber population are currently selected ad hoc in a time consuming trial-and-error process.  We will perform a series of chronic animal studies to develop and test automated methods for tuning each stimulation paradigm and selecting optimal parameters to maximize performance and generalize them to other neural interface technologies.   The resulting tuning and optimization methods resulting from these studies will be verified clinically with users of a variety of implanted neuroprostheses, and will ultimately be suitable for transfer to other clinical applications."
"9561230","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Control (CC)  The over-arching goal of the Cancer Control (CC) Program is to reduce cancer risk and mortality and to  improve the quality of care and quality of life for individuals and populations. Program members conduct  cancer behavioral research, addressing the adoption of cancer-causing behaviors by adolescents and young  adults, and health services research, addressing the impact of emerging technologies and health care policies  on cancer care and outcomes across the continuum from prevention to screening and treatment. Working  together through inter-disciplinary teams that include physician-scientists, behavioral and communications  scientists, functional brain scientists, psychologists, decision scientists, economists, statisticians, geospatial  and health services researchers; 35 program members from 11 departments actively are pursuing six  scientific themes: (1) Media and marketing influences on adoption of tobacco, alcohol and eating behaviors  during adolescence; (2) Tobacco regulatory research, (3) Geospatial research addressing how local geography  affects cancer behaviors and outcomes; (4) Comparative effectiveness of emerging cancer screening and  treatment technologies; (5) Studies that characterize how practice variation and health care reform affect  cancer care and outcomes; and (6) Effective communication of the benefits and harms of cancer screening  and treatments, to foster informed choice and enhanced survivorship through decision support. Translational  goals include establishing the scientific basis for regulatory policies, aimed at tobacco and other cancer  causing behaviors, and for policies that guide cancer screening and the delivery of cancer care. Major  program accomplishments include establishing a scientific basis for policies to limit movie smoking cues and  translating those findings into policies that reduced exposure, publishing paradigm-shifting studies on  overdiagnosis as it relates to cancer screening and diagnosis, conducting practice-changing clinical trials that  affected recommendations for lung cancer screening and early palliative care, and delivering cancer care to  the rural underserved. Program Co-Directors actively recruit scientists and foster a stimulating inter-  disciplinary research environment through monthly research group meetings (behavior and health services),  working group meetings (lung screening, decision support/survivorship), quarterly full program meetings, and  active mentorship of Program members. NCCC further supports CC Program research through pilot funding  and strategic recruitments of new investigators, including early-stage investigators who have strengthened CC  ties with The Dartmouth Institute. Members heavily use the Biostatistics Shared Resource, which now includes  geospatial services essential to our ongoing research. More than 470 cancer-related manuscripts have been  published in the reporting period (17% in journals with an impact factor of 8 or more), with 32 members on  intra-program (151=32%) and 21 members on inter-program (89=19%) collaborations. Total Program funding  currently is $9.6M, of which $9.1M is peer-reviewed and $3.8M is from NCI."
"9409891","SUMMARY: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of covalently closed RNA species that are found in high abundance across tissues and species. Due to its circular nature, circRNA is resistant to exonucleases. Putative functions of circRNAs include: 1.) miRNA sequestration, 2.) RNA-binding protein scaffolding, 3.) mRNA trapping, and 4.) protein translation regulation. Such diverse and important roles in gene regulation have led researchers to link circRNA to several disorders, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological, and neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, changes in circRNA levels in the tissues and serum samples of diseased patients have led researchers to suggest that circRNAs can be used as biomarkers for certain cancers and Alzheimer?s disease, and even as a potential therapeutic agent. Despite all the excitement around circRNA, the progress in this field has been extremely slow. An important reason for this paucity in research is the lack of easy-to-use and robust tools to detect and track individual circRNA of interest in biochemical and cell-based samples. Existing circRNA detection methods such as divergent PCR, mRNA traps, northern blot, and RNase R treatment followed by gel analysis are slow, cumbersome and require time-consuming preparative steps. New methods that allow rapid and direct detection of any specific circRNA of interest in biochemical and cell-based samples will accelerate the pace of circRNA research and its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and/or a therapeutic agent. In this phase I project, we will leverage Lucerna?s proprietary SpinachTM technology to develop a modular circRNA sensor platform that allows rapid detection of circular RNA of interest in a simple mix-and-read format. In the preliminary data, we demonstrated feasibility by developing a prototype circRNA sensor that shows nearly eight-fold increase in fluorescence signal when bound to the ciRS-7 back splice junction sequence. In the next stage we will incorporate a chimera probe design that will allow the ciRS-7 sensor to distinguish circular ciRS-7 from other competing species such as linear RNA with repetitive exons and linear ciRS-7 pre- or mature mRNA. We will further develop the ciRS-7 sensor into a mix-and-read cell based assay by optimizing conditions such as buffer, cell lysate concentration, sensor concentration, read time, and more to achieve excellent sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range. At the end of the project, we will have validated the modular circRNA sensor platform and will commercialize the ciRS-7 sensor as a marketable assay product for biochemical and cell-based applications."
"9406426","Abstract: The lack of data to inform treatment guidelines in patients with severe asthma remains a major unmet need. Our vision is to develop a personalized medicine approach for the treatment of severe asthma, directed at its pathogenesis and ultimately translatable to the community health care setting for implementation. Because traditional clinical trial designs are inefficient for diseases with multiple phenotypes, our central hypothesis is that the application of an adaptive trial design will identify subtypes of severe asthma that will be most responsive to precise interventions. The scientific rationale for this proposal includes recent data showing that elevated blood eosinophils, maximum FEV1 reversal, and plasma IL-6 concentrations are risk factors for frequent exacerbations which are a major component of severe asthma. Each of these phenotypes has precise interventions that are FDA approved for asthma or other diseases, namely anti-IL-5 antibodies, long acting muscarinic antagonists, and anti-IL6 receptor antibodies. We propose the following Specific Aims to test this hypothesis: 1) To determine the impact of phenotype-directed interventions on the frequency of asthma exacerbations using a sequential Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design, stratified by blood eosinophils, maximum FEV1 reversal, and plasma IL-6 concentrations; and 2) To validate the predictive value of monitoring biomarkers assessed at baseline and after three months of treatment. These biomarkers include sputum eosinophils, heart rate variability, C-reactive protein levels, air trapping and other imaging metrics assessed by low dose chest CT scan, and measures of airway oxidant stress. Our team of multi-disciplinary investigators and translational science clinicians in the Great Lakes PrecISE Partnership has access to a diverse population of patients with severe asthma from Wisconsin and Northern Illinois which will enable us to be a very active partner in this collaborative network. We expect to rapidly identify patient subsets that benefit from therapies not currently considered as part of the asthma pharmacopoeia. The efficient assessment of these biomarkers and precise treatments would not be possible without this departure from the typical therapeutic development process."

CCSG renewal and new institutional commitments of $65M and 20K sf of space will allow the UCCC to maintain its upward trajectory of high impact contributions and help reduce the cancer burden in its catchment area and worldwide."
"9564280","Gastroparesis (GP) in children and adults is characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. GP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality yet little is known regarding its incidence, prevalence, and natural history, particularly in children. This knowledge gap in pediatric GP is exacerbated by lack of both normative data for gastric emptying and a GP specific patient reported outcome measure. The limited data suggest significant differences between clinical symptoms of GP in children vs adults. Thus, even the limited data regarding GP in adults are unlikely to provide insight and fill the knowledge gaps regarding GP in children. These issues (among others) underscore the need for childhood GP specific research strategies rather than translation of adult based GP knowledge to this very different population.  To begin to identify effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies leading to improved outcomes for children with GP given the vast knowledge gaps in the field, we propose the following Specific Aims within a prospective, multiinstitutional collaboration:  1) Using the 13C-Spirulina breath test (BT) (which correlates well with gastric scintigraphy) define normal values for solid meal emptying in (n=260) healthy controls (HC) (5-18 yrs. of age). Sub-Aim: carry out the BT in children (n=420, 5-18 yrs. of age) with presumed GP who are undergoing gastric scintigraphy to identify children who truly have GP as defined by the normal values obtained in HC.  2) In children undergoing gastric scintigraphy in (Sub) Aim 1, determine the feasibility, reliability, and validity of generic and gastrointestinal (GI)-specific health-related quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scales and PedsQL GI Symptoms Scales and PedsQL GI Worry Scales. Sub- Aim 2A: Use the scales to differentiate patients with GP vs. age, gender, and race/ethnicity matched children with functional dyspepsia (whose symptoms often overlap with GP) and HC; Sub-Aim 2B: Use the GI scales and cognitive interviews to create a pediatric GP-specific health-related quality of life measure.  3) Create a national prospective: (a) Registry of children and adolescents with GP to include demographic, clinical, psychological, and nutritional characteristics and (b) Biorepository of serum, GI mucosal biopsies (in those undergoing upper GI endoscopy), and stool for future analyses such as DNA, cytokines, microbiome.  This multidisciplinary approach is innovative as it will, for the first time, prospectively begin to fill the vast knowledge void regarding GP in children. These data will be an important step toward targeted and pediatric- friendly interventions for children with GP. This project also will be a first step to developing a national pediatric consortium to investigate GP in children. The current proposal fits RFA-DK-16-010 to, among other goals, better understand the epidemiology of GP, define the GP/FD spectrum, explore and design new patient reported outcomes, and the role of the human microbiome on disease expression."
"9464820","PROJECT SUMMARY We will develop and commercialize to the research community a new class of glycan-specific binding reagents that incorporate the recognition function of variable lymphocyte receptors (?VLRs?), the antigen receptors of the adaptive immune system of jawless vertebrates, lamprey and hagfish. Such reagents are essential to detecting, localizing, quantifying, and establishing biological function(s) of specific glycans in normal and disease cells and tissues, and may additionally lead to development of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. The current absence of such reagents is a significant barrier to further advancing an understanding the role of glycans in health and disease. VLRs are composed of tandemly arranged highly diverse leucine-rich repeat (LRR) structural motifs with diversity comparable to the human immunoglobulin (Ig) antibody repertoire, and possess a distinctive more rigid binding site geometry vs Ig antibodies that is entirely contained within a single polypeptide structure. Vertebrates split into jawless and jawed vertebrate lineages approximately 550 million years ago. The evolutionary separation of jawless vertebrates from humans and other mammals, and the distinctive binding site geometry of VLRs potentially provide novel specificities and functions not accessed with Ig antibodies. This expectation is supported by the discovery of VLRs that bind carbohydrate antigens with affinity and specificity superior to that typically achieved with Ig antibodies and indicate that VLRs are uniquely well-suited to binding and discriminating glycan structures. The lamprey VLR-based immune system is potentially a transformative technology for the rapid, high throughput production of specific binding reagents for the diverse glycan structures that comprise the human glycome. With this phase 1 STTR application we will initiate this application of the lamprey VLR-based immune system by demonstrating that lamprey can be immunized to produce VLRs that specifically bind and discriminate each of the four most common mucin-type O-linked glycan core structures in humans. In our follow-on phase 2 studies we will express these VLRs in a form that facilitates use for detecting, quantifying and modulating the functions of the four mucin-type O-linked glycan core structures and provide these reagents to the research community."

"9447692","Summary Technical Innovation: We have identified a series of specific, well-characterized biomarkers that adipocytes use to regulate energy balance (BCAA?s), appetite (leptin) and inflammation (adipokines). Assays for each of these analytes will be developed with temporal resolutions <1 min, allowing fast changes in uptake or secretion to be measured in response to acute environmental stimuli for the first time. Technologies that will be developed include: online microdialysis-capillary electrophoresis (MD- CE), online aptamer-micro free flow electrophoresis (FFE) affinity assays and online FFE-MALDI. Biological Hypothesis: The assays developed in this proposal will be used to test the hypothesis that artificial sweeteners affect adipocyte metabolism and signaling. The safety of artificial sweeteners is based on the presumption that they are metabolically inert. Any observed changes in BCAA, leptin or adipokine uptake/release would indicate that artificial sweeteners have a direct effect on adipocyte metabolism, appetite control and/or immune response. Long Term Biomedical Significance: The assays developed in this proposal will allow the acute effect of food additives or other stimuli on adipocyte regulation of energy balance, appetite and inflammation to be measured for the first time. These assays will provide valuable information for both assessing the safety of the food supply as well as achieving a better understanding of how adipose tissue regulates these important functions. Together these data may provide key insights into the origins of metabolic disorders and suggest strategies for breaking the cycle of rising obesity levels that is quickly becoming a worldwide epidemic."
"9440627","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In May 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Final Rule, bringing electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and other products that meet a statutory definition of a tobacco product under its authority. Federal law explicitly prohibits five categories of labelling and advertising for tobacco products including: (1) false and/or misleading; (2) FDA-approved or FDA-endorsed, without FDA approval; and (3) modified risk tobacco product, without FDA approval. Additionally, ENDS cannot be marketed as a product for (4) smoking cessation or for (5) other therapeutic purposes, without prior approval from the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Although these types of ENDS claims have been documented online and in print media, it can be difficult to identify prohibited claims as they are often implicit. The FDA has been tasked with considering consumer perceptions of such claims when determining if they are prohibited; however, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding consumer perceptions of health claims. Additionally, no research has been conducted on advertising claims made in vape shops, which are the fastest growing segment of ENDS retailers. This study will build upon a pilot grant that developed the methodology to photographically document ENDS claims in vape shops using wearable imaging technology. In the proposed study, we will use this methodology to conduct an additional wave of data collection to document claims in vape shops. The claims from both the pilot and the new wave of data collection will be combined to create a comprehensive list of unsubstantiated claims for use in a survey, which will investigate consumer perceptions of them. It will be the first of its kind to assess how consumers interpret these real-world ENDS health claims made by retailers. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed robust methodologies for capturing claims in the ENDS retail environment; expanded the knowledge of the types of ENDS claims being made to consumers; and developed measures for assessing consumer perceptions of those claims, all of which will aid the FDA in making determinations of whether such claims fall into one of their prohibited categories. This focused project, led by a New Investigator working with a nationally recognized team of collaborators, will lay the groundwork for future, larger studies that will increase the body of evidence regarding ENDS and directly inform the process in which the FDA identifies and classifies prohibited advertising claims."

"9433323","There is a growing interest by the medical genomics community in using metabolomics data to complement genomic (DNA) and gene expression (RNA) studies. The goal is often to understand the molecular processes of disease in order to facilitate identifying novel therapeutic approaches as well as using molecular profiling as an aid in treatment decisions. Methods for metabolomics data analysis are typically not accessible to clinicians and and there is a pressing need for the development of strategies for integration of both data types in biomedical research. Both Conesa and McIntyre have developed software tools to make metabolomics data analysis and interpretation easier for scientists with a genetics background. McIntyre developed a Galaxy module for the analysis of metabolomics data that identifies differentially expressed metabolites. Conesa created the PaintOmics tool, a web-based resource to jointly visualize metabolomics and genomics data over the template of KEGG pathways. However a fully integrated analysis platform is still missing. In this R03 we will join the previous developments from both groups to create a platform for the integrative analysis of genomics and metabolomics data based on the Galaxy environment. In Aim 1, and based on existing solutions from PaintOmics, we will develop a module to import KEGG into Galaxy and map lists of significant differentially expressed genes and metabolites onto the KEGG pathways. A full re-implementation of the PaintOmics Java code into Phyton scripts will be needed. In Aim 2 we will develop new statistical methods to for integrative pathway analysis using genomics and metabolomics. Will use the KEGG topology to identify subgraphs enriched for significant features of both omics by analyzing the probability for a gene being differentially expressed condition to the differential expression of a neighboring metabolite. We will also adapt previous developments in the McIntyre lab that infer genetic interaction networks to predict additions of unidentified significant metabolites into the metabolic networks. By using the biologist-friendly Galaxy platform we expect to make metabolomics-genomics integration more accessible to clinicians, help the biomedical community to understand the relationship between gene expression and metabolite changes in relation to disease and contribute to the development of new clinical insights that lead to novel therapies and/or diagnostics."

DMAS will make extensive use of existing informatics systems at Yale University and existing caBIG technology. The Core will emphasis the Interactions with the wider skin cancer community. For Aim 2, the Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Core will address the analytic questions arising from the SPORE projects. Service provided by the Core will range from planning activities to consulting on specific analytic questions. More specifically, the Core will schedule regular meetings with the SPORE investigators, and maintain an open door policy for any bioinformatics/biostatistical questions. Since the observed data can have characteristics different from hypothesized, the Core will conduct regular interim analyses, dynamically update the power calculations, develop new statistical and bioinformatics methodology as needed, provide timely suggestions to SPORE investigators, and thus play an important role in the entire study."
"9459617","PROJECT SUMMARY The number of people with diabetes worldwide is predicted to increase from 415 million in 2015 to 642 million in 2040. The health care costs of treating the disease account for 12% of the global health expenditure and continue to be a huge economic burden (IDF World Atlas 2015). Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) constitutes 10-15% of the disease burden and is an autoimmune disease, thought to be triggered by genetic or environmental factors in early childhood, which results in antibody-mediated destruction of insulin producing pancreatic ?-cells causing life-threatening hyperglycemia. In contrast, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) develops later in life and results from insulin resistance in target tissues and inflammation coupled with an inadequate compensation by the ?-cells.  The precise mechanisms that trigger the cascade of events ultimately leading to beta cell death are still not fully understood. Several observations have prompted renewed interest in the beta cell itself as a target tissue that could initiate the disease process. In this context the recent identification of RNA methylation as a potential regulatory mechanism that contributes to the ability of a cell to adapt to rapid changes in the environment provides a provocative approach to investigate changes in beta cells that precede the development of the type 1 diabetes phenotype. We seek to interrogate alterations in the dynamic methylation of RNA, specifically, N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) in beta cells to identify the signatures that might provide important clues to processes that contribute to beta cell death. In this proposal we will: 1). Characterize the dynamic RNA methylation changes in islet cells obtained from models of type 1 diabetes; 2) determine the functional relevance of alterations in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in human islets and ?-cells; and 3) explore changes in additional methyl marks in RNA in islet cells from models of T1D mouse model. Finally, we will contrast the RNA methylation changes observed in the islets in the T1D models with proteomics and gene expression signatures in islets obtained from patients with T1D."
"9448687","Language impairment, or aphasia, is a common problem after left hemisphere stroke, and causes significant long-term disability. After the initial period of healing, recovery from stroke relies on plasticity in brain networks spared from direct stroke damage. Thus, to improve behavioral and biological treatments for aphasia, we must understand how spared brain structures and connections contribute to recovery. Over a century of research has demonstrated that left hemisphere areas surrounding the stroke and right hemisphere areas symmetric to the normal left hemisphere language network participate in aphasia recovery. However, the mechanisms by which these areas are recruited and their roles in language recovery remain unclear, particularly for the ?right hemisphere language network.? We propose to examine the role of spared brain structures and connections in recovery of core language functions in a large group of left hemisphere stroke survivors and matched controls. The innovative methods address major limitations of prior studies by accounting for individual differences in stroke severity, using task-independent brain structure and connectivity measures, and examining several core language functions as defined by statistical analysis of an extensive behavioral assessment battery. Preliminary studies using this new approach suggest that parts of the right hemisphere language network grow after stroke, and that these changes improve language outcomes. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that recruitment of the right hemisphere language network after left hemisphere stroke compensates for language deficits. We will test this hypothesis against multiple alternative hypotheses, using advanced brain imaging methods to test for effects throughout spared parts of the brain. Analyses will examine how spared brain structures and connections contribute to language recovery, accounting for individual differences in stroke severity. We will additionally test for signs of brain plasticity after stroke and test relationships between stroke location and patterns of brain plasticity to better understand the mechanisms of recovery. New multi- modal analysis methods will integrate the brain structure and connectivity data, providing a more complete picture of recovery of language functions than has been possible before. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the biological basis of aphasia recovery, which will be vital in order to design maximally effective treatments."

"9459106","PROJECT SUMMARY A loss of ?-cell mass and biologically active insulin is a key feature of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Thus, increasing ?-cell mass, for example with small molecules, has become an area of major research interest in the diabetes community. Our groups have recently reported the discovery of small molecules capable of inducing human ?-cell proliferation; however, the potential for inducing wide-ranging proliferation across multiple tissues and cell types makes such an approach risky. Here, we aim to develop a zinc-based prodrug (ZnPD) system for targeted ?-cell delivery of small molecules that promote ?-cell proliferation. This system will enable us to perform early-stage preclinical validation that selective ?-cell delivery will be safer and more effective than nonselective systemic administration."
"9452526","Project Summary The Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) came about from discussions at the 2007 NCI Immunotherapy Agent Workshop, in which high-priority agents were identified that showed the potential to benefit patients with cancer?but that were not yet broadly available for investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Since 2007, a sea change has occurred in the field of cancer immunotherapy, resulting from the success of anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1. However, most of the priority agents identified in the NCI Workshop are still not broadly available for academic IITs. Since the original award in 2011, the CITN focused on testing these high-priority agents, including 5 of the top 8 ranked agents that hit targets critical for optimal immune responses. CITN trials are among the few academic IITs of these agents, and each trial has defined biologic and therapeutic principles. Two trials have led to changes in clinical practice. The abbreviated Specific Aims for the CITN are as follows: Aim 1: (a) to continue to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for adult cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (b) to form a Pediatric CITN (PedCITN) to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for pediatric cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (c) to provide leadership, infrastructure, and statistical support for the conduct of these clinical trials; (d) to continue to access high-priority agents central to immune responses and not broadly available for IITs Aim 2: to coordinate studies with Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and other labs for specimen analysis (immune monitoring, biomarker credentialing) of adult and pediatric patients on CITN trials Scientific Goals of the CITN 1. Continue trials with T cell and natural killer cell activator and growth factor IL-15, homeostatic T cell growth  factor IL-7, dendritic cell activator anti-CD40, dendritic cell growth factor Flt3L, and IDO inhibitor  anti-PD1 2. Continue trials with anti-PD1 for orphan and ultra-orphan indications, including pediatric cancers 3. Conduct biopsy-intense trials to identify actionable causes of anti-PD1 failure and linked to therapeutic  administration of potential rescue agents 4. Conduct trials to assess therapies that eliminate or activate the myeloid, monocytes/macrophage, and/or  myeloid-derived suppressor cells that reside within most cancers 5. Conduct multicenter Phase I and early Phase II immunotherapy trials for pediatric patients with cancer The results will inform future trial designs and improve the understanding of these high-priority agents. CITN trials are designed to identify paths to regulatory approval and will likely change standard practice or spur confirmatory pivotal trials by NCI cooperative groups and industry for adult and pediatric cancers."

"9409281","Abstract: In this SBIR application miRecule proposes to develop a microRNA-based therapeutic mimic of miR-30-5p (miRecule candidate MC-30) for the treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancers. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common form of cancer. Greater than half of patients present with late stage III or IV disease, with an average 5-year survival rate of ~40%. HNSCC tumors have high levels of genetic mutations leading to high tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. miR-30-5p expression is widely repressed in tumor tissues, and MIR30 gene deletion is observed in ~30% of HNSCCs. miR-based therapeutics offer a disruptive MDR cancer treatment by targeting both the primary oncogenic pathways and potentially suppressing mechanisms of intrinsic or acquired resistance. EGFR targeted therapy is often resisted by overexpression of the compensating growth factor receptors (GFRs) MET and IGF1R. We have made the novel discovery that miR-30-5p can target and repress all three of these GFRs. The rationale for our design is that a miR-30-5p mimic will be superior in its ability to treat heterogeneous late-stage HNSCC due to its ability to regulate not only EGFR, but also MET, IGF-1R, and over two dozen other mRNAs confirmed to be deregulated in tumor tissue and associated with over-proliferation, adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix remodeling, and differentiation. Our early study shows that a chemically modified mimic of miR-30-5p, exhibiting significantly improved efficacy over the biological microRNA, was effective at inhibiting tumor growth in vivo in a preclinical model of HNSCC.  A significant hurdle for nucleic acid therapeutics is a lack of an efficient means of delivering them specifically to target cancer cells, especially at the metastatic stage. To overcome this obstacle, we employ two unique strategies. First, our chemically modified mimic of miR-30-5p has vastly improved nuclease stability and activity, decreasing the amount of mimic that needs to be present in the cell to produce the desired effect, and extending the duration of response. Second, our mimics are encapsulated in a clinically validated tumor- targeted liposomal nanodelivery system (scL). The nanocomplex carries an scFv antibody fragment against the transferrin receptor (TfR), which is up-regulated on the surface of most cancer cells and triggers uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In this Phase I SBIR study we aim to we will characterize the half-life of our lead nuclease-stabilized mimic in HNSCC cells, targeting of multiple oncogenic mRNAs and signaling pathways, and test our hypothesis that it can more effectively combat drug resistance in vitro (Aim 1). We will test this mimic in a cetuximab and cisplatin-resistant orthotopic xenograft mouse model of HNSCC and compare directly with standard of care cisplatin and cetuximab. We will also assess potential toxicity and off- target effects. (AIM2) Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of MC-30 as a drug candidate and dosing regimen to be used in future PK, TOX, ADME, and other animal studies as required for an IND package. Once FDA approved and commercially available MC-30 will offer an effective treatment of MDR HNSCC and perhaps other cancers for which there are currently no treatment options."
"9374700","RELIEF ABSTRACT This developmental project combines the expertise of our Cornell transdisciplinary team and of our partner, the Institute for Family Health (IFH). We propose to test the reach, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of Relief, a 9-session behavioral intervention for older and middle-aged primary care patients with chronic pain and depression. Relief was jointly developed with IFH and is designed to be administered by licensed social workers (LCSWs) and/or nurse practitioners (NP) of IFH primary care practices. Our conceptual model assumes that chronic pain and depression are characterized by an attentional bias assigning greater salience to interoceptive stimuli and to negative emotions, along with a difficulty in shifting attention to goal-oriented/reward-driven state, leading to inadequate engagement of the reward networks. Accordingly, Relief aims to shift patient attention away from pain and negative feelings and to increase their focus and engagement in meaningful and pleasurable activities. Relief also assesses patient views on pain treatment (which may be adversely affected by depression, corrects unrealistic expectations, and helps to enhance communication between patients and primary care physicians. To improve its delivery and enhance behavioral assessment, Relief uses easy-to operate smartphone apps. We will recruit 60 adults (50+ years old), from four randomly assigned, large IFH primary care practices that screen all patients for depression with the PHQ-9. Two practices will offer Relief (N=40) and two will offer referrals (based on clinical indication) for mental health care (RMH) (N=20), provided at the practice site. Participants will have clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 ?10) and suffer from pain (during most days for ? 3 months). To facilitate future implementation studies, LCSWs and NPs of the IFH will be trained and administer Relief. Assessments will be conducted at entry, and at 6, 9, & 12 weeks. Specific aims include: Months 1-4: 1) To finalize the Relief manual and train and credential IFH therapists in Relief; 2) Develop an operations manual for procedures implementation; Months 5-24: 3) Assess Relief's reach, feasibility, and acceptability; 4) Evaluate preliminary effectiveness; 5) Assess preliminary evidence of target engagement; and 6) Perform exploratory analyses on sex differences, quality of life, pain medication use, suicidal ideation, cost and savings. We will use the results of this project to support an R01 application to rigorously test the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, non-billable costs and savings, and barriers to implementation of Relief in a randomized effectiveness trial in a wide range of large practices beyond New York."
"9560382","Project Summary/Abstract Treating the immune response within tumors is a major focus of new therapeutic development. Much of the focus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is currently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently isolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully understand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate T cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason that checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible for upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is dysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies. In this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years. Specifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how they play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off antigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these processes are affected by checkpoint blockades. Finally, in aim 3, we will seek to understand the normal and intratumoral production of the cytokine Flt3L, a key player in regulating the number of these rare cells. At the end of this work, we will understand how these intratumoral myeloid cells function on their own and in concert with T cell therapies."
"9454682","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cochlear nucleus (CN) is the first neural station of the central auditory system that processes all sound information from the auditory nerve (AN). Principal neurons of CN encode different aspects of sound, including information about the temporal fine structure (TFS) that is essential for auditory tasks like sound localization and speech detection in noisy environment. During age related hearing loss (ARHL), the central processing of TFS information is compromised, leads to perceptual deficits. The overall hypothesis is that modifications in CN neurons and neural circuits during aging contribute to the malfunction of auditory temporal processing that underlies ARHL. The project investigates the cellular mechanisms of ARHL in CN bushy neurons, which are specialized in processing TFS information, as well as their excitatory inputs from AN and inhibitory inputs from CN interneurons during aging. Our previous studies showed that synaptopathy occurs at AN central terminals during ARHL, specifically the endbulb of Held synapses, which show age related degradation in transmitting auditory information to postsynaptic bushy neurons. The decrease in endbulb function is due to compromised synaptic transmission that is associated with dysregulated calcium signaling at the synaptic terminal. In Aim1, the project investigates the mechanisms of different calcium signaling pathways during aging at the endbulb of Held synapse, including calcium uptake and removal, calcium influx via voltage gated calcium channels, synaptic vesicle replenishment, as well as the expression of different calcium sensors. Our prior study also found that bushy neurons are depolarized and more excitable during aging. In Aim2, the project will test the hypothesis that auditory system enhances central gain in bushy neurons to compensate for the weakened AN input during ARHL. Mechanisms of voltage-gated ion channels during ARHL will be studied by quantifying membrane conductances that underlie neural excitability in bushy neurons during aging. In Aim3, the project will elucidate the mechanisms of inhibition during ARHL by investigating the effect of inhibition on firing property of bushy neurons, assessing synaptic strength of glycinergic inputs, and evaluating the neural excitability of CN interneurons as well as their AN inputs during aging. To achieve these goals, the project utilizes techniques including behavioral hearing test (auditory brainstem response), whole-cell recording under current or voltage clamp mode using acute brain slices, pharmacological manipulation, as well as immunohistochemistry, using CBA/CaJ mice as the animal model for ARHL at ages up to 30 months. These studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying ARHL, which is fundamental and essential for developing therapeutic approaches to restore neural processing in the central auditory system and eventually reinstate sound perception in patients with hearing impairments."
"9467943","Project Summary The goal of this project is to understand the role of WIP1 (Wild-type p53 Induced Phosphatase 1) mutations in clonal hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis is a hierarchically organized process of blood cell production, with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at the top of the hierarchy. HSCs reside in the bone marrow and are characterized by the ability to self-renew or differentiate into various types of mature blood cells. HSCs can acquire somatic mutations with age, and clones harboring certain mutations can gain a competitive advantage that manifests as expansion of the clone. This phenomenon is termed clonal hematopoiesis, and is associated with increased risk of hematologic diseases and all-cause mortality. WIP1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in clonal hematopoiesis, but very little is understood about the effect of WIP1 mutations on HSC function. The presence of expanded WIP1-mutated hematopoietic clones with age indicates that mutant WIP1 affects the regulation of hematopoiesis. Furthermore, WIP1 mutations were found to be enriched in the blood of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) patients compared to de novo MDS patients, suggesting that the selective pressure of stress may further contribute to the expansion of WIP1-mutated clones. Our overarching goal is to gain insight into the mechanisms through which WIP1 mutations drive hematopoietic clonal expansion with age and stress. We hypothesize that HSC clones with truncated WIP1 have a competitive advantage over their wild-type counterparts, due to the role of WIP1 in regulating cell response to cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we will re-create the WIP1 mutation in hematopoietic cells and determine the biochemical and cellular phenotypes of the mutant. We will also examine the effect of the WIP1 truncating mutation on HSC function in vivo. We will then determine the mechanism of WIP1 clonal expansion following cellular stress. Together, these proposed studies will lend insight into the role of WIP1 in HSC biology, and will help us achieve the long-term goal of facilitating healthy aging of stem cells."
"9465033","The long-term objective of this project is the synthesis and assembly of wound healing devices that mimic, as closely as possible, the biochemical and mechanical characteristics of healthy human skin. The proposed research would focus on the synthesis of membranes containing electrospun human recombinant tropoelastin and collagen mixtures. The ratios of the two molecules and the spinning conditions can be adjusted to mimic the matrix of human skin. These wound healing devices can then be applied to chronic wounds to accelerate wound closure and improve the strength and flexibility of the resulting scar.  One of the most important applications of such wound healing devices is to chronic wounds in patients suffering from diabetes. These wounds cause significant morbidity and mortality and remain a challenge for treatment. The proposed work would extend earlier promising studies in a murine model to the rapid closure of wounds in a [splinted full thickness wound model in diabetic mice], an untested biochemical and physiological background. The hypothesis is that the presence of a scaffold that mimics the protein composition and structure of skin will stimulate the regrowth of skin cells and accelerate wound closure. The resulting scar will also be stronger and more flexible, due to the presence of elastin, and less prone to subsequent failure.  Introducing tropoelastin/collagen scaffolds into wounds in diabetic mice and measuring the rate of wound closure relative to standard of care controls will test these hypotheses. Once the wounds have healed, the scars will be removed and subjected to mechanical tensile strength testing, with the results again compared to the scars produced in standard of care controls. A successful outcome of the proposed work, defined as a statistically significant improvements in closure rate and wound tensile strength compared to controls, will provide a basis for the development of a new, more effective wound closure device for chronic wounds."

"9415768","TECHNOLOGY CORE SUMMARY The two primary goals of this Center are to build a whole brain transcriptome atlas and a more detailed forebrain cell anatomy atlas. These goals will be achieved by three Research Segments that will be supported and enhanced by transcriptomic technologies and pipelines developed and refined in the Technology Core. The Core's functions will be managed by the lead Dr. Anthony Zador (CSHL), and supported by co-leads Drs. Evan Macosko (Broad Institute) and Edward Boyden (MIT). First, we will optimize and integrate MAPseq and Drop-seq for high-throughput projection mapping of molecular classified neurons. MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing) is a novel technology developed by the Zador laboratory with the capacity to determine the long-range projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons in a single experiment. The combination of MAPseq and Drop-seq has the potential to relate projection patterns with transcriptomes at an unprecedented scale. Second, we will integrate MAPseq with in situ sequencing to determine the long-range projections of neurons whose spatial position and molecular identity is precisely determined. This technique offers significantly improved spatial resolution over using MAPseq alone, and will enable rapid and affordable brain-wide survey of gene expression and projection with high spatial resolution. Optimization of the throughput, resolution, and cost efficiency of these techniques in the Technology Core will complement and enhance the goals of this Center and those of the BRAIN initiative cell census network to define the composition of the mammalian brain at the cellular level."

We will develop three interrelated educational strategies that will increase the number of underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students attracted to and retained in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) pathways as preparation for research careers: 1) For teachers, provide a multi-year mentored research experience that provides professional growth, increases understanding of scientific careers, and results in curricula that will engage students. The curricula will be designed in collaboration with staff, advisors, and FHCRC scientists, and tested with Pathways students as well as in teachers' classrooms; 2) For early high school students, develop a two-week introductory outreach program that increases the pool of eligible young students interested in science in general and cancer research in particular; and 3) For early undergraduate students, create an individualized, mentored, multi-year internship program that increases the retention of underrepresented students in STEM pathways for the purpose of pursuing cancer research careers. This program gives students a strong scientific foundation, professional preparation, and builds their identity as scientists. Our approach leverages the extensive resources of FHCRC including a large faculty of committed scientists, state of the art facilities, safe training labs, and two existing FHCRC internship programs. The two existing programs (for seniors in high school and seniors in college) have been instrumental in pointing out gaps in our educational continuum and have informed our program design resulting in a holistic, comprehensive pathway for cancer research career development.

"9441325","PROJECT SUMMARY During development of diverse organisms, many cells become polarized as part of the differentiation process. One example of this event occurs in the one-cell C. elegans embryo, a process that establishes the anterior-posterior (AP) body axis. In many cell types, this polarization event is cued through interactions between the actomyosin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Despite much work on polarity, the interactions between and regulation of these events are still not fully understood. PAM-1 is a puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase required for centrosome positioning during polarity establishment in C. elegans. Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidases (PSAs) are widely conserved and have important developmental roles in meiosis, cell cycle progression, and reproduction in organisms from plants to mice. Additionally, PSAs have been suggested to play a protective role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer?s and Huntington?s. The proposed work seeks to characterize the role of PAM-1 in regulation of the cortical actomyosin cytoskeleton. In addition, suppressors of pam-1 will be described to determine if actomyosin regulation by PAM-1 is separable from the centrosome positioning and polarity roles. In addition, the gene identities of the suppressors will be determined. Time-lapse imaging of strains bearing GFP-tagged proteins will be analyzed to follow the organization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, the position of the centrosome, and polarity establishment in pam-1 mutants. In combination with RNAi of cytoskeletal components, the role of PAM-1 in these processes will be uncovered. Similar analysis will be done in suppressed strains to compare cytoskeletal organization, centrosome movements, and polarity in each suppressed strain. Single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping and whole genome sequencing will be employed to identify each suppressor mutation and candidates will be verified by RNAi, protein localization, and genetic analysis. It is hypothesized that cloning and characterization of these suppressor mutations will reveal novel proteins that work in conjunction with PAM-1 and as targets of the aminopeptidase during regulation of the cytoskeleton and polarity establishment. Given the implication of PSAs in neurodegeneration, identification of targets in C. elegans may also advance the understanding of disease mechanisms. Additionally, new players in centrosome positioning will be identified which may be applicable to other systems. The proposed experiments will be largely carried out by undergraduates who will be mentored to provide them the guidance and expertise needed for success in science careers and graduate work."
"9404860","Shared Resource Core (OGB) Summary Human malignant neoplastic diseases have been extensively characterized by functional genomics approaches during the past decade, allowing the identification of different cancer molecular subtypes and the development of prognostic and predictive biomarkers. However, no studies have been reported comprehensively screening for the mutational and transcriptomic profiles of AIDS-associated malignancies (AM). The three interrelated projects of the U54 will employ the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platform to perform mutational and transcriptomics studies of AM biopsies as well as in-vitro and in vivo tumor studies using different murine models and cancer cell lines. Detailed unraveling of the AM genome coupled with a deeper understanding of its transcriptome and their viral associated factors will be instrumental to understand the molecular mechanisms and pathways that govern the progression of these neoplastic lesions. We will create a bilateral Oncogenomics (located at UM, USA) and Bioinformatics (located at UNLP, Argentina) Core (OGB) that will provide investigators access to resources not currently available for the Argentina Labs and centers investigators. The bilateral OGB-Core facility will be in charge of the design, generation, pre-processing, statistical and data mining analysis of the functional genomics data generated by the NGS platform available at OGB Core. The genomic data and clinical data will be centralized at the core server providing unified functional genomics resources that will serve as hub for coordinating converging approaches. Furthermore, the OGB Core will provide training to all junior scientists, Argentina investigators from the network as well as new investigators attracted via Pilots program offered by the U54 Consortium."
"9537133","Project Summary Structural Basis of APOBEC Functions and Interactions with HIV-Vif The APOBEC (Apolioprotein B mRNA-editing Enzyme Catalytic polypeptide) family of cytidine deaminases deaminate are found only in vertebrates and all APOBEC3 subfamily proteins are found only in primates. By deaminating the cytidine to cause mutation to uridine on DNA/RNA, APOBEC enzymes achieve remarkably diverse cellular functions through specific targeting to the intented ssDNA or RNA through a combination of regulations including spatial and temporal and substrate specificity. For example, APOBEC1 (A1) specifically modigy the mRNA of a protein that play a role in cholestoral metabolism; AID, another member of APOBEC family, is required for antibody maturation process including somatic hypermutation and recombination class switch; APOBEC2 (A2) is involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle development; and A3 proteins, a subfamily contains seven members (AA-H), can restrict foreign and internal nucleic acids that poses danger to the genome integrity, which include internal retroelements and transposons as well as external retroviruses and otherinfectious viral pathogens, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) . For retroviruses like HIV viruses to overcome the anti-HIV activity of APOBEC enyzmes, they encode a protein called Vif (virus virulent factor) that specifically bind to and inactivate APOBEC enzymes through unbuquitination degradation parthway. Even though their deamination activity is the key to excercute their biological functions, APOBEC enzymes can accidental mutations when proper regulations are not in place, which could lead to human deseases such as immune difficiency and cancer. Our long- term goals are to understand the structural/functional relationship for APOBEC cellular function and their anti-viral activity. Our specific aims are to understand the structural basis of APOBEC's functions and and the mechanisms that underlie substrate specificity and anti-HIV and anti-viral activities, with particular focuses on the APOBEC3 subfamily members that have strong anti- retroelements and anti-HIV activities. The outcome of this proposed research will provide valuable information for understanding the molecular details of the APOBEC enzyme family and the mechanisms of substrate specificity, which can be used for the potential drug development to provide therapy for HIV/AIDS, immune disorders, and other diseases such as cancer."
"9563343","?    DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant): The overarching objective of the Center for Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging (CMROI), a Biomedical Technological and Research Center (BTRC), is to develop innovative Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Optical imaging-based biomarker technologies in support of the biomedical research community both at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) and across the country. These technological developments are driven by collaborations between clinically oriented and technologically oriented investigators to address specific clinical    problems and to further fundamental understanding of biophysical, physiological, structural, molecular and functional properties of physiology and pathophysiology in vivo. Based on the compelling projects identified by our collaborators, we have developed 4 broad areas of Technological Research and Development (TRD) research.        The first TRD project involves the development of novel rotating frame MR techniques with exchange-mediated contrast that have high spatial and temporal resolution. These techniques are aimed at studying the biochemical and metabolic aspects of brain, tumors, heart and connective tissues, leading to clinical applications in neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and cardiac diseases, arthritis, and cancer. The second TRD focuses on the development of optimized, single-shot, whole-brain, perfusion MRI for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF), at 3T used for applications in functional brain imaging, pharmacological MRI, and as a biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases, further development of perfusion MRI at 7T targeting measurement of white matter CBF, and further development of a novel method for direct imaging of myelin water for applications in demyelinating disease. The third TRD focuses on the development of novel MR strategies for efficient data acquisition and reconstruction based on the radial k-space trajectory, with application in dynamic    cancer and cardiac imaging and multi-parametric MRI. The fourth and final TRD is oriented towards noninvasive and minimally invasive diffuse optical imaging and monitoring. Development of bedside probes based on diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) facilitate concurrent monitoring of blood oxygenation and blood flow, respectively, in brain and spine, and a novel, multi-modal optical-MRI breast cancer imaging system will be optimized in standard-of-care hospital MRI scanners        The resource emphasizes synergistic TRD work that is driven by collaborators both from within the home institution and from across the country. Service includes usage and access to the state-of-the-art MR imaging systems including 7T and 3T whole body research magnets, pre-clinical MRI resources, optical imaging instrumentation, polarized gas imaging facilities, and the distribution of pulse sequences and computer analyses software developed by the resource to external sites. The resource also maintains an extensive training and dissemination program in biomedical imaging through a multitude of seminars, workshops, peer reviewed publications, targeted courses, hands-on training and a dedicated website. Furthermore, organized plans and operating procedures for the administrative core contributes to the seamless functioning of the resource. The resource has an exceptional scientific environment in the form of world-class faculty, senior research investigators, and outstanding institutional commitment. It remains committed to intellectual interchange and the interdisciplinary pursuit of basic and clinical medicine through the proposed developments and thus has all the attributes required for a national BTRC."
"9439668","Abstract Twenty percent of the U.S. population resides in rural communities. In rural areas, residents need to travel greater distances to access specialty services of the healthcare system. Typically, healthcare facilities in these rural areas are small and provide limited services. Often, due to geographic distance, extreme weather conditions, environmental and climatic barriers, lack of public transportation, and challenging roads, rural residents may be limited or prohibited from accessing specialty health care services. In this phase II proposal, Koronis Biomedical Technologies (KBT) proposes a system to overcome some of these barriers by monitoring cystic fibrosis (CF) patients at home. Currently, the standard of care for reoccurring CF respiratory exacerbations includes coming to a specialized CF clinic or the hospital for pulmonary function evaluation when symptoms occur. Pulmonary function tests help clinicians know when lung function has declined. However, clinicians currently do not monitor lung function at home, nor do clinicians have any insight on therapy adherence. There are currently 120 CF centers in the U.S. accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation with only five in the entire states of Minnesota (2), North/South Dakota (2), Montana (1) and Wyoming (0). In many cases, patients travel a long distance to reach these specialized CF centers. The proposed system creates an innovative home system that connects patients in rural areas with clinicians and provides a feedback loop between therapy and diagnostic monitoring. The phase II proposal will develop a web application that will allow secure remote access to pulmonary function data and therapy adherence. This system will provide a means of early detection of pulmonary exacerbation and reducing the number of costly and stressful hospitalizations and clinic visits."
"9404858","Around 80% of viral cancers occur in countries with emerging economies such as LMICs. An important subset of virally induced malignancies occurs in the context of HIV/ AIDS (AIDS associated Malignancies/ AM). Latin America have a high prevalence of AIDS-associated Malignancies caused by viruses (including HR-HPV, EBV, KSHV) which tend to disproportionally affect underprivileged and socially vulnerable populations. The current consortium addresses the need of developing research strength in AIDS associated Malignancies while developing a critical mass of independent basic, translational and clinical AIDS-malignancies researchers of Argentina. The current U54 will focus in the career development of junior scientists belonging to an existing consortium of UM CFAR with Argentina Labs through the development of mentored research focusing in the general theme and cancer type of ?Basic, translational and Clinical research and training network in virally- induced AIDS-defining malignancies disproportionally affecting Argentina populations with highest risk of HIV/ AIDS?. In the case of Buenos Aires this is both the MSM population with a 11% HIV-infection incidence and the transgender women (TGW) population with an HIV-infection incidence of 37% which are at also the highest risk for infection with oncoviruses KSHV and HR-HPV, and to develop KS and anogenital carcinoma. It will further develop areas emerging from highly complementary and integrated current research of the consortium projects supported by highly tailored Career Enhancement and Shared Resources Cores that will leverage the outstanding research, human resources and infrastructure for HIV/AIDS and viral oncology research available at UM's CFAR, Sylvester Cancer Center, Argentina institutions and the powerful network of Argentine US scientists in USA associated with the consortium. Its components will include an Administrative core, a career enhancement core, a shared resource core and three projects of mentored research that will leverage and enhance the scientific and clinical capacity of the network, generating and leveraging a repository of clinical samples and longitudinal cohort that will enable to correlate clinical findings with molecular/genetic data.

"9362859","Project Summary/Abstract The overarching goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the mechanisms by which synonymous mutations affect the abundance and turnover of synthesized proteins in cytoplasm with ensuing effect on fitness. We determined that synonymous substitutions in the folA gene encoding the essential E. coli enzyme Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) have broad effects: synonymous substitutions of rare codons to frequent ones at the 5' end of the nucleotide sequence cause significant drop of the amount of mRNA produced while the ones near the 3'- terminus result in depletion of soluble, active DHFR protein. We will broadly investigate the relationship between DHFR folding thermodynamics and kinetics and its post-translation abundance in cytoplasm for a broad coverage of sequence space including both missense and synonymous mutations. We will focus on the role that protein quality control (specific proteases and chaperones) play in amplifying or mitigating fitness effects of synonymous mutations and determine the evolutionary paths by which E. coli recovers the fitness losses incurred by specific synonymous mutations. Lessons from the DHFR study will be used as guidance for a broader exploration on the level of complete genomes of several organisms from E. coli to human with the aim to link conservation of specific synonymous codons to the position-specific aspects of protein folding pathways. To this end we will apply our recent algorithm for structure- based predictions of protein folding pathways to predict location of rare conserved codons based on only the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Altogether these studies will provide deep mechanistic insights into the origin of fitness effects of synonymous substitutions and their evolutionary consequences. It will help to discern the forces of evolutionary selection from sequence analysis data. Further, it will enable to identify the causal relationship between mutations and disease phenotype ? an unmet medical need in the era of data driven approaches to development of new therapeutics."
"9547565","Approximately 15% of women sustain pelvic muscle injuries during vaginal birth, demonstrable through magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Our geometric model suggests the pelvic floor muscles stretch up to 3.3 times their original length during the second stage of birth. Based on MR imaging, histological, studies, and biomechanical modeling, when injury occurs, we hypothesize an initial rupture of the pubic attachment ofthe pubovisceral muscle (Type 1 injury), in some women followed by an avulsion of the pubic attachment of the arcus tendineus levator ani (Type 2 injury). We seek funds to characterize the  variation of tissue in these injury zones and document their failure loads.  AIM 1 will characterize the morphology and histology of pubovisceral and arcus tendineus tissues, bi-axial material properties where appropriate, and uniaxial failure properties in 30 cadavers. In 20 volunteers, we will use ultrasound elastography to characterize the effect of pregnancy on perineal body elasticity.  AIM 2 will use Aim 1 data to refine a subject-specific, 3-D finite element viscohyperelastic biomechanical model of the second stage of labor from Station +2 on. We will test the above hypotheses with regard to the sequence of Type 1/Type 2 injuries, and run parametric studies to determine the biomechanical factors that increase or decrease the risk of Type 1 and Type 2 injuries. We will validate the model with stereophotogrammetric measurements of perineal descent in 10 laboring women.  Since maternal exhaustion is a major risk for instrumented delivery and levator muscle injuries, in AIM 3 we will use a repeated measures design to quantify the outcomes in 40 healthy non-pregnant volunteers between 21 and 30 years of age to study the energetic cost of Valsalva pushing with and without (a) maximal arm and (b) arm and thigh muscle isometric contractions.  These observations will yield insights into the factors associated with the greatest risk for injury, and should lead to better methods of preventing these injuries."
"9380413","Abstract  The human ABCC6 ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC-) transporter has been implicated to play a role in multiple human connective tissue diseases, including pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). The loss of ABCC6 function putatively results in the loss of one or more circulatory factors that regulate the mineralization of elastic tissues systemically. Multiple disease-causing mutations in ABCC6 have been identified in PXE patients, yet their molecular impacts on ABCC6 structure and function are unknown. The work presented in this proposal is directed at addressing several key questions that are fundamental to our understanding of the molecular pathologies in ABCC6 and identifying mechanisms for targeted therapeutic development to correct these defects, specifically: (1) How do mutations alter the biosynthesis and function of ABCC6? (2) Are there mechanisms that can be used to correct these defects to restore protein function?  Our preliminary data, systematically evaluating a large library of ABCC6 mutations, demonstrates that mutations can be broadly grouped into multiple structural and mechanistic classes. Two categories result in altered protein folding and are differentially distinguished by their effects on local and global protein structures. The third category of mutation is putatively associated with altered protein function. These studies provide a fundamental understanding of ABCC6 structure and function and novel insight into the molecular defects associated with specific disease-causing mutations. Our preliminary data further suggest a mechanism(s) that restores mutant ABCC6 biosynthesis and function. This mechanism of stabilization rescues multiple severe, disease-causing mutants within ABCC6. Characterization of this rescue provides additional insight into the biosynthesis of wildtype ABCC6 and the defects associated with mutant ABCC6. In addition, these studies lay the groundwork for future mechanism-based targeted therapeutic development.  Using a combination of cell biological, biochemical and functional assays, these studies are designed to elucidate the molecular defects and means of correction of ABCC6-associated disease mutations. This combination of approaches, including newly developed structural and functional assays, will provide a comprehensive view of the biosynthetic pathway of the ABCC6 ABC-transporter in both normal and mutant states. By extension, these studies will inform research on other human ABC-transporters, including those regulating cholesterol homeostasis and associated with cystic fibrosis, for which active therapeutic development efforts are ongoing. Thus, these studies will inform current and future PXE research efforts and studies of human diseases associated with ABC-transporters."
"9483498","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Progress in transdisciplinary, multi-level intervention (MLI), behavioral health disparities research is dependent on an ample supply of well-trained professionals. The overall goal of the Investigator Development Core (IDC) is to foster research in behavioral health disparities by training and mentoring post-doctoral fellows, junior faculty, and other early stage underrepresented minority (URM) and non-URM investigators. The IDC will provide the infrastructure, resources, and support for community-academic partnerships that address behavioral health disparities through research. The IDC will also provide training and mentoring that covers the TREE Centers thematic elements (e.g., social determinants of behavioral health including historical trauma, adverse childhood events) as well as methodologic approaches (e.g., MLI, transdisciplinary research, and community-engaged research). The specific aims are to: SA1. Develop and implement a pilot project program which includes procedures for soliciting, submitting, reviewing and selecting projects related to the social determinants of behavioral health, particularly historical trauma, ACES, and the intersectional effects of poverty and discrimination. SA2. Increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) and non-URM post-doctoral students, junior faculty, and early stage investigators with the ability to conduct behavioral health disparities research using a community-engaged, transdisciplinary and MLI focus. SA3.

SA4. Develop novel approaches and methods to support junior researchers and new investigators as they collaborate with community partners to identity, develop, implement, and disseminate transdisciplinary, MLI research focused on behavioral health disparities. Achievement of these aims will create a robust team of well-trained behavioral health disparities researchers pursuing a better understanding of the mechanisms behind how historical trauma, ACES and the intersectional effects of poverty and discrimination contribute to behavioral health disparities and how to address these mechanisms to improve behavioral health outcomes."
"9447756","Increased resistance to sinusoidal blood flow is an important component of early as well as advanced portal hypertension. This results from an imbalance in intrahepatic vasoconstrictor and vasodilator molecules, the latter including nitric oxide (NO). Our laboratory has been on the cutting edge of advances in understanding the molecular basis for the imbalance in NO. Seminal among our discoveries is that there is a (dramatic and remarkable) reduction in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) dependent NO release by sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs).  Our focus has been on understanding the mechanism underlying this defect. Preliminary data presented in the current application has identified highly novel post-translational defects in eNOS in SECs after liver injury, including reduced phosphorylation of eNOS caused by reduced levels of a novel protein known as G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase interactor-1 (GIT1) that regulates eNOS phosphorylation, activity and NO production. In the basal state, GIT1 is the most potent stimulator of eNOS we have identified to date. Extensive new preliminary data provide a foundation for the hypothesis that GIT1 acts GIT1 acts as a scaffolding partner for a macromolecular complex including eNOS and other proteins that together regulate eNOS function in a spatiotemporal fashion. Importantly, the reduction in GIT1 expression after liver injury, have led us to hypothesize that post-translational defects in eNOS after liver injury are critical in the sinusoidal endothelialopathy that accompanies liver injury, and further, that GIT1 is a central component.  The overarching goals of this new project are twofold. First, with a future objective being to translate our work to humans with liver disease, we wish to validate the importance of GIT1 in vivo. Secondly, we wish to uncover fundamental basic mechanisms that regulate eNOS function. Therefore, our specific aims are as follows: We will (1) define the functional importance of GIT1 in vivo in normal and injured liver, (2) characterize the molecular interaction between GIT1 and eNOS, and determine how GIT1 tyrosine phosphorylation affects this interaction and eNOS function, and (3) determine how the GIT1 binding partner, ??PIX (an integral component of a putative multiprotein signaling module) contributes to regulating eNOS function. The proposed experiments will uncover novel mechanistic aspects of eNOS structure and function and as such have fundamental therapeutic implications not only for patients with liver disease and portal hypertension, but also for those with other vascular disorders."
"9450136","ABSTRACT  Young hypertensive African American (AA) males have a 10 to 14-fold greater risk for kidney disease than any  other hypertensive group. The reason for this striking disparity remains unknown. What is known is that racism  significantly contributes to disease risk in AAs. Our preliminary results suggest that the stress hormone system  is activated in AA males in association with perceived racism but not in AA females. These findings raise the  questions: why do AA males' experiences of racism result in activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal  axis (HPA) system and how are AA males and females different in their biological response to perceived  racism (PR)? This project proposes to investigate these important questions. The conventional conceptual  frame for racism and disease suggests that maladaptive coping methods in perception of stress and in  response to racism or stress in general can promote the activation of the HPA system while adaptive methods  may mititgate the HPA activation. Therefore, we posit that the AA male health disparity may result from use of  maladaptive coping methods that leads to activation of the HPA resulting in increased stress hormones  aldosterone (ALDO) and cortisol and sympathetic nerve output, both of which promote cardiorenal diseases.  ALDO is known to: be elevated in kidney disease; be higher in AAs; and promote kidney injury in the setting of  salt-sensitive hypertension by activating the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) resulting in subsequent  inflammation and fibrosis development through RAC 1 pathway signaling. Thus, ALDO is a stress hormone  that likely plays a major role in the kidney disease disparity in this vulnerable group. To test our hypothesis we  will recruit AA males and females and administer psychosocial surveys to determine their perceived racism  and stress levels; their use of maladaptive coping (anger and hostility); their use of adaptive coping (social  support); and their levels of ALDO and cortisol. We will determine whether adaptive coping acts to buffer the  increase in ALDO and cortisol while maladaptive coping promotes the increase in ALDO and cortisol levels.  Furthermore, we will determine if the ALDO and cortisol levels are associated with increased risk for kidney  injury in AAs. We also use animal model to confirm that increased ALDO and cortisol can cause kidney  damage in the setting of hypertension. The results from this study will be the first to show the underlying  pathophysiology (ALDO) link between racism and kidney disease and, consequently, provide new insights that  could lead to more precise treatment of AA for hypertension that will prevent the development of kidney  disease that is often associated with hypertension."
"9405129","One of the major challenges in neuroscience is to understand the experience-dependent mechanisms that drive the changes in neural circuits that underlie complex behaviors, and how these mechanisms are altered in disease. Altered synaptic transmission has been implicated in a number of human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism and addiction. Considerable recent evidence from our labs and others has demonstrated that specific patterns of neural activity at individual synapses can drive the growth, stabilization and elimination of synaptic connections. However, how complex patterns of neural activity at multiple synapses in vivo interact to drive changes in circuit connectivity remains poorly defined. Specifically, the relative role of neural activity at clustered versus distributed synaptic inputs, and that of integrated versus patterned neural activity, in driving synaptic and circuit plasticity has been difficult to determine, primarily due to the lack of adequate imaging probes to monitor the history of activity at individual synapses. New tools are needed. The overall objective of this research proposal is to develop novel glutamate sensors for large-scale monitoring of the activity of individual synapses in the living behaving animal. We will focus on two specific objectives: (1) developing glutamate integrators for visualizing the history of neural activity at individual synapses in large fields of view during short behavioral epochs and (2) developing glutamate highlighters with slower kinetics that will enable large-scale monitoring of transient responses at individual synapses in the living animal. Existing tools for monitoring glutamatergic signaling at individual synapses, such as the genetically- encoded glutamate sensor, iGluSnFR, are excellent for characterizing the activity of individual synapses in small fields of view with high temporal precision; however, due to the fast kinetics and transient nature of the glutamatergic responses at individual synapses, these sensors are not suitable for real-time monitoring of synapses in large fields of view. Here, we propose to develop glutamate sensors that permit monitoring activity at individual synapses over larger fields of view and also with the spatial and temporal resolution to mark activated synapses amongst the distributed circuitry. Indeed, our proposed glutamate integrators will transform the activity of transient synaptic inputs into permanent labels of active synapses, enabling access to information mapping neural activity to the structure of the neural circuitry underlying a specific physiological process or behavioral task. To accomplish these goals, we will use a multidisciplinary approach incorporating genetic strategies, computation-guided protein design, two-photon imaging, glutamate uncaging and electrophysiology. First, we will use high-throughput, multi- step sensor screening, photophysical characterization, and ligand-binding specificity measurements to generate candidate sensors. Next, we will generate synaptically targeted sensors, and characterize the sensitivity and kinetics of lead sensors in dissociated neuronal culture and in brain slices. Finally, we will characterize the expression, sensitivity and kinetics of lead sensors in vivo in zebrafish and in mice. If successful, the proposed research will provide much needed imaging tools of synaptic activity that are compatible with a variety of advanced imaging techniques, such as wide-field, confocal and two-photon microscopy, and would dramatically enhance our understanding of how the history of neural activity at individual synapses and their neighbors can influence long-term stability of neural circuit connections."
"9528197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, with ~520, 000 new cases diagnosed every year. High risk human papillomavirus (hrHPVs) have been detected in almost all cervical carcinomas and are thought to be major risk factors for cervical cancer. However, epidemiological studies show that fewer than 4% of women infected with HPV develop invasive cancer. The majority of infected women never develop cancer in their lifetime. Therefore, unknown factors unique to individual hosts appear to contribute to the dysplastic transformation and disease progression. The molecular mechanisms controlling the initiation and progression of cervical cancer are poorly understood. The Hippo pathway has been reported to play critical roles in tumorigenesis in several cancers, including in ovarian cancer. However, the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer has not been examined. Our preliminary studies clearly indicate that YAP, the major effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, is overexpressed in cervical cancer and is associated with poor patient survival. Overexpression of wild type YAP or constitutively active YAP promotes proliferation of cervical cancer cells and drives transformation of immortalized cervical epithelial cells. Knockdown of YAP suppressed cervical cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, YAP stimulated growth of human cervical cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice. Intriguingly, we found that the HPV16 E6 protein interacts with YAP to regulate proliferation of cervical cancer cells. We hypothesize that the Hippo pathway plays a central role in the initiation and progression of cervical cancer. In the proposed project, we will systematically examine the role of the Hippo/YAP pathway in the initiation and progression of cervical cancer; determine the potential interaction between the Hippo/YAP pathway and hrHPV oncoproteins using transgenic mouse models, and explore the potential signaling mechanism by which the Hippo pathway interacts with hrHPV oncoproteins to regulate cervical carcinogenesis. Successful achievement of this project will identify the Hippo/YAP pathway as a novel and key regulator of the tumorigenic process in the cervix. These findings will not only significantly expand our knowledge on cervical carcinogenesis, but will also provide new targets for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer. Moreover, accomplishment of the proposed study will also open new windows for the prevention and treatment of other HPV-associated cancers."
"9407610","Inhibition of Resistant Variants of HIV Protease HIV/AIDS is a serious pandemic with over 36 million infected people. Antiviral drug therapy has decreased the mortality, although the number of new infections remains about 2 million per year. However, the genetic diversity and high mutability of HIV pose a critical challenge for continued efficacy of drugs and development of effective vaccines. Hence, there is urgent need for new therapies to overcome the problem of drug-resistance. We are tackling this challenge by studying the important drug target of HIV protease. Clinical resistance arises even for the potent antiviral inhibitor darunavir. Our structural analyses have identified distinct molecular mechanisms for resistance including mutations that: 1) decrease protease interactions with inhibitors; 2) decrease the enzyme stability; or 3) influence the dynamics. In the last project period, our X-ray structures have guided the design of novel inhibitors 10-fold more effective than darunavir against highly resistant proteases. We have developed algorithms to predict resistance from genotype sequences and have identified representative mutants with high level resistance. We propose to identify common mechanism for resistance and apply these insights to design and assess new inhibitors. These multidisciplinary studies leverage the expertise, unique resources and novel approaches developed in the PIs groups together with an established set of collaborators to integrate computational, X-ray crystallographic, biochemical and biophysical techniques with inhibitor design, chemical synthesis, and virology studies. The expected outcomes will be 1) accurate predictions for resistance, 2) discovery of novel and conserved molecular mechanisms for resistance, and 3) new antiviral inhibitors for resistant HIV infections."

"9454728","Project Summary Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in early childhood causing serious motor and sensory impairments. About 30% of children with CP have congenital hemiplegia, resulting from periventricular white matter injury (PV-WMI), which impairs the use of one hand and disrupts bimanual co-ordination. Congenital hemiplegia has a profound effect on each child?s life and, thus, is of great importance to public health. Changes in brain organization often occur following PV-WMI varies depending on the timing, location, and extent of the injury, as well as the functional system involved. Understanding these changes is essential for the development of novel or improved neurological rehabilitation strategies. This R21 application is designed to identify abnormal functional and anatomical brain reorganization associated with hand function in young children (18-24 months) with congenital hemiplegia due to unilateral PV-WMI using an innovative multi- modal neuroimaging approach. Multi-modal neuroimaging studies are rare in children with CP, and are nearly non-existent in young children with CP. By capitalizing on recent advances in pediatric magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion MRI based multi-tensor tractography (MTT), we propose to develop an innovative pediatric MEG-guided MTT technique to determine the brain function-structure relations in young children with congenital hemiplegia. For pediatric MEG, we will use the BabyMEG system, a pediatric MEG system with unique features designed specifically for children 0 to 3 years, which is available at Boston Children?s Hospital. We hypothesize that motor commands of the paretic hand in children with unilateral PV- WMI are generated in the contralesional hemisphere, while sensory feedback is processed in the ipsilesional hemisphere. To test our hypothesis, we plan to: (i) determine with pediatric MEG the functional maps of the primary motor cortex (M1) during active movements of the index finger, and of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during passive movements of the index finger and during tactile stimulation of the thumb, middle, and little fingers; (ii) determine the integrity of the corticospinal motor and thalamocortical sensory tracts using our MEG-guided MTT technique; and (iii) correlate the functional changes in the activation maps of M1 and S1, and the structural changes in the corticospinal motor and thalamocortical sensory tracts, with the hand motor performance assessed with the Assisting Hand Assessment test. Our study will provide detailed insights into the neuroplastic mechanisms involved in the reorganization of hand sensorimotor function following lesions to the developing human brain. Our research will have direct impact on the quality of life of children with congenital hemiplegia, as well as other forms of CP, because it has the potential to: (i) inform the development of neurorehabilitation strategies tailored to individual patients? measurements, (ii) facilitate the development of plasticity-promoting interventions for specific brain networks, and (iii) determine optimal therapy parameters and which patient populations will benefit from such treatments."
"9467096","PROJECT SUMMARY There are currently over 326,000 patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) around the globe. Clinical outcomes are dictated largely by the dextrose and sodium concentrations used in each session. However, the state of the art in APD systems is woefully deficient: clinicians must choose from only 3 dialysate dextrose concentrations available and have no choice for sodium concentration. While researchers have widely published the benefits of limiting glucose exposure to prolong the life of the peritoneal membrane, no APD device allows users to deliver an intermediate dextrose concentration. In addition, recent evidence suggests that hypertensive PD patients (up to 80% of the PD population) could benefit from a reduced dialysate sodium concentration to remove excess sodium from the bloodstream and improve blood pressure. To dramatically improve the clinical options for optimal PD therapy, Simergent proposes the Faraday?: an automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) device which can enable individualized glucose sparing and sodium adjustment therapies by creating on-demand custom solution concentrations needed to improve cardiac outcomes and prolong membrane function. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will develop an APD pumping engine prototype that will take the patient?s own home tap water, sterilize it, then accurately admix it with one to four additional sources. An enormous side benefit of our technology is that its use can reduce the shipping, storage, and lifting burden of dialysate bags by 92% by mixing concentrated dialysate solutions with sterile water generated at the patient?s home. Specific Aim 1: Create a prototype admixing disposable tubing set: Design and manufacture a disposable cassette and associated tubing set capable of admixing fluids from 5 sources and delivering to a mixing bag. Specific Aim 2: Manufacture and test working APD pumping engine prototype: Design and manufacture a functioning prototype hardware & software system to interface with the cassette and validate the volumetric accuracy is ?1.5%. Specific Aim 3: Create customizable sodium concentrations: Design and demonstrate a mechanism which will accurately admix low-sodium dialysate and hypertonic saline (2 sources) to create sodium concentrations ranging from 100 to 170 mmol/l in increments of 10 mmol/l to support personalized sodium adjustment therapies. Specific Aim 4: Create customizable dextrose concentrations: Design and demonstrate a mechanism which will accurately admix 5 sources: concentrated dialysate solution (2 dextrose concentrations), buffer solution, saline, and sterile water to create solutions ranging from 1.0% to 4.5% dextrose in increments of 0.25%. Our Phase I feasibility results will culminate in a revolutionary prototype demonstration subsystem critical for admixing fluids from disparate sources. In Phase II, we will integrate this into a fully functioning APD device."
"9415771","SUMMARY ? Cell Tool Segment A brain cell atlas is essential but not sufficient for understanding brain function. Armed with knowledge of the cell census and wiring diagram of the brain, neuroscientists further need to be able to systematically observe and manipulate the activity of defined cell types across many contexts. This requires reliable experimental access to comprehensive sets of neuron types. The overall goal of the Cell Tool Segment is to leverage molecular and anatomical information gained in the Molecular and Anatomical Research Segments to establish experimental access to (1) a comprehensive set of forebrain projection neuron types and to (2) rare and/or fragile populations of cells from the molecular whole-brain Atlas. In addition, we will generate reporter lines and viral vectors that enable Cre / Flp labeling based on the intersection or subtraction of two driver lines and/or anatomical (viral) labeling, enabling greater specificity in labeling through application of more complex identifying criteria. We aim to generate a restricted but highly selected set of knock-in driver lines that achieves maximal coverage of neuron types at high specificity. We will maximize coverage, specificity, and impact through combinatorial use of Cre and FlpE alleles, anterograde and retrograde viral vectors, and/or temporal regulation of recombinase activity to label neuron types based on intersecting criteria. Cell populations captured by novel markers and driver lines will feed back into the Molecular and Anatomical segments in an iterative process to refine cell type definition. In addition, these tools will allow the application of a full range of modern techniques to defined cell populations to achieve concerted in-depth studies, including physiological and functional studies during circuit operation and behavior. These genetic tools will not only further our Center's goal of assembling a single-cell atlas of the brain, but also provide the field with powerful, validated tools to enable systematic studies of brain network organization, function and development."
"9485644","Abstract  Chronic diseases are the most substantial threat to women?s health across the globe; affecting lifespan, quality of life, and functionality. Minority women in the United States, particularly African-American and Hispanic, are disproportionately impacted by chronic diseases, and the effects are amplified for those living at or near the federal threshold for poverty. Complex and multi-level factors contribute to chronic disease, including genetics, behavioral choices, and social determinants such as economics, environment, stress, early childhood development, social exclusion, social support networks, and access to healthy food and health care. Some health behaviors, such as physical activity, sedentary time, stress management, and nutrition, have been identified as a mechanism with which to substantially reduce the incidence and impact of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.  The Texas Center for Health Disparities received NIMHD funding to address women?s chronic health conditions through community outreach and research strategies from 2012-2017. A workgroup of community members, former research and program participants, and UNTHSC faculty and staff utilized a Community- Based Participatory Research (CBPR) process to design SHE Tribe (She?s Healthy and Empowered), a social- network based initiative to support healthy behavior adoption among women in underserved communities. This effort was based on our earlier finding that women in underserved neighborhoods were often resistant to participating in a ?disease-labeled? intervention (e.g., obesity prevention) and expressed a desire to practice wellness-oriented behaviors that have been adapted for their social and cultural groups. These findings were consistent with the growing body of literature indicating that being ?healthy and strong? is perceived as more desirable than engaging in a program where the explicit expectation is to lose weight. As part of the development process, the workgroup sought to develop a sustainable, evidence-based approach that would appeal to underserved communities that are disproportionately impacted by chronic disease.  This exploratory 2-year project will address the following aims:  AIM 1. Determine whether SHE Tribe can be feasibly implemented with groups of women from communities at high risk for chronic health conditions.  AIM 2. Examine how health behaviors are adopted by individuals and diffused through social networks. The impact of this study will be the refinement of an intervention that supports sustainability and reach in underserved communities that are at high-risk for chronic diseases. The emphasis on a constellation of healthy behaviors and the use of peer facilitators will appeal to the cultural identities of women residing in underserved and/or high poverty communities."
"9402564","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose a 5-year cluster randomized trial with a factorial design to evaluate the efficacy of a multi- level intervention that addresses stigma in accessing healthcare, social support, and individual risk behaviors of adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in South Africa. We will collaborate with the Department of Health to ensure that PrEP is available for all HIV-negative AGYW who engage in condomless sex. Under the Expanded Public Works Program (EPWP), supported by the Department of Health and Social Development, female beneficiaries will help serve as peer recruiters and PrEP club leaders. We will engage all stakeholders and establish a Youth Advisory Board (YAB) to inform the adaptation of the evidence-based empowerment intervention, the Women's Health CoOp (WHC)?which addresses gender-based violence (GBV), substance use, and sexual risk?to address reproductive health and PrEP uptake and adherence. Using a similar stakeholder engagement approach, we will also adapt a stigma and discrimination (S&D) reduction training curriculum for clinic staff. The multilevel strategy will be implemented and evaluated through two levels of randomization. First, we will randomize geographic zones (1:1) to the health clinic S&D training arm or the no training arm. Clinics located in health clinic training zones will participate in workshops aimed to reduce health providers' stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes and behaviors. The training aims to reduce AGYW's barriers to healthcare access to enhance PrEP uptake. Second, we will randomize trained and non-trained clinics to one of three arms (1:1:1): Arm 1: provision of PrEP only; Arm 2: provision of PrEP with a PrEP club for social support to increase adherence; and Arm 3: provision of PrEP with a PrEP club as well as the WHC to address PrEP uptake and adherence alongside other risk factors such as personal agency, GBV, and substance use. Primary outcomes will include initiation of and adherence to PrEP to prevent HIV infection; secondary outcomes will include reduction of HIV risk behaviors. The proposed Specific Aims are as follows: Aim 1: To engage stakeholders, the Community Collaborative Board, and the YAB in adapting the WHC and S&D reduction training, establish PrEP clubs, and train 24 EPWP beneficiaries as recruiters to identify AGYW engaging in high-risk sex in 6 zones in the Pretoria area during a formative stage. Aim 2. To evaluate the impact of training on S&D among healthcare staff on the use of HIV and reproductive health services by AGYW, including PrEP, and staff attitudes and behaviors toward AGYW at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3. To test the efficacy of a multilevel strategy that addresses structural (stigma and discrimination), interpersonal (social support), and individual (personal agency, substance use, and GBV) factors on PrEP uptake and adherence (primary outcomes) and condom use, GBV, substance use, and HIV incidence (secondary) at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up among vulnerable AGYW."
"9361210","PROJECT SUMMARY Increased availability of biomedical data sets across spatial and temporal scales makes it possible to calibrate complex models that capture integrated processes from the molecular to the whole organism level. This complexity poses multiple challenges related to mathematical modeling, software design, validation, reproducibility, and extensibility. Visualization of model features and dynamics is a key factor in the usability of models by domain experts, such as experimental biologists and clinicians. The proposed project addresses these challenges in the context of the immune response to an important respiratory fungal infection. Its goal is to develop a novel modular approach to model architecture, using a recently introduced technology of lightweight virtual machines and our user-friendly open-source platform for the construction and linking of these so-called ?Docker containers? to create complex modular models in a transparent fashion. A key benefit of software containers is that they can encompass the entire computational environment of a model, enabling unprecedented reproducibility of computational results. The overarching computational goal is to develop a novel approach to the modular design of multiscale models. While broadly applicable, this novel computational modeling approach will be focused on the development of a multiscale model capturing the early stages of invasive aspergillosis, an important health problem.  Invasive aspergillosis is one of the most common fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts and carries a poor prognosis. The spores of the causative organism, Aspergillus fumigatus, are ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Healthy hosts clear the inhaled spores without developing disease, but individuals with impaired immunity are susceptible to a life-threatening respiratory infection that can then disseminate to other organs. The increasing use of immunosuppressive therapies in transplantation and cancer has dramatically increased suffering and death from this infection, and this trend is expected to continue. Current therapeutic approaches have been focused primarily on the pathogen, but a better understanding of the components of host defense in this infection may lead to the development of new treatments. In particular, restricting iron availability is a critical mechanism of antimicrobial host defense; conversely, successful pathogens have evolved potent mechanisms for scavenging iron from the host. These mechanisms have the potential to be harnessed therapeutically. The biological focus of the proposed project is the battle over iron between the fungus and the host. The overarching biomedical goal is to develop a simulation tool to explore the role of iron in invasive aspergillosis across biochemical and biophysical conditions."
"9438808","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity is a major public health problem that disproportionately affects rural men1 and promotes the development of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and cancer.2 This study proposes to evaluate a 3-month mobile self-monitoring application (app) with Wi-Fi scale and text messaging intervention (MT+: mobile technology plus) for achieving weight loss in overweight and obese rural men. Weight loss interventions for rural men constitute a gap both in the literature and current NIH-NINR research portfolios. Using a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and community engaged research (CEnR) approaches, this study aims to: 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a smart phone self-monitoring app (Lose-It Premium) plus SMS text-based and daily weighing via Wi-Fi scale intervention (MT+) for achieving weight loss, 2) determine preliminary efficacy of MT+ to a comparison group receiving only a self- monitoring app (Lose-It Basic) (MT) in achieving the outcomes of weight loss (kg and % body weight-primary) and improved dietary and physical activity (PA) behaviors (secondary) at 3 and 6 months post-baseline, and 3) determine quantitative and qualitative indicators of community capacity to support a contextually relevant weight loss intervention. Eighty men (ages 40-65) with BMI of 28-45 kg/m2 will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to intervention group (MT+) or comparison group (MT). Men will complete baseline assessments (weight (kg), % body fat, BMI, height, blood pressure (BP), health history, dietary intake, PA intensity) and receive orientation to the mobile technologies (Lose-It app features, SMS, Wi-Fi scale). Men will track their dietary intake, PA, and weight on the Lose-It app for 12 weeks. After the 3-month intervention, post-measure assessments (weight-kg, % body fat, BMI, dietary intake, PA frequency/intensity, and technology usability surveys) will be collected at 3 and 6 months post-baseline. At 6 months post-baseline, two groups (n=8 each) of MT+ completers will be purposively selected to share their perceptions of the intervention efficacy in evaluative focus groups. A community advisory board (CAB) comprising local leaders within the men?s social network, together with investigators and rural student nurses will guide community outreach efforts for study recruitment, implementation, and evaluation. Study findings will be evaluated with the CAB to inform local dissemination, future intervention revision, and determination of community capacity for support of a larger clinical trial."
"9356787","Overall SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Ovarian Cancer SPORE is to improve outcomes for ovarian cancer patients by combining targeted agents based upon the molecular, cellular and clinical biology of their disease and understanding and targeting mechanisms of drug resistance. Over the last 6 years (FY2009-FY2015), MDACC has cared for 4,483 patients with ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancers. MDACC has given high priority to ovarian cancer research through recruitment, salary support, clinical facilities, laboratory space, and philanthropic funds. Over the last 6 years, MDACC has recruited six outstanding faculty members with an interest in ovarian cancer research (Drs. Amir Jazaeri, Larissa Meyer, Alpa Nick, Shannon Westin, Melinda Yates, and Behrouz Zand). Philanthropic support of the Women?s Cancer Breast-Ovarian Moon Shot has provided organization and infrastructure. Over the same time period, our previous SPORE funded 15 Developmental Research Projects (DRPs), and supported six Career Enhancement Program (CEP) awardees, and SPORE investigators have contributed 461 peer-reviewed papers pertaining to ovarian cancer with 53% (246) IF >5 and 20% (92) >10. Achievements included: 1) evaluation of a two stage screening strategy with a positive predictive value of >30% for detecting stage I-II disease in 9 of 12 cases detected; 2) identification of biomarkers that detect 18% of CA125 negative cases; 3) development of a point-of-service nanoassay for these biomarkers; 4) discovery that anti-TP53 autoantibodies rise 5 (median) -13 months (mean) prior to CA125, the first biomarker to provide earlier detection than CA125; 4) observation of a 54% objective response rate to anti-angiogenic therapy with aflibercept and docetaxel; 5) initiation of a trial targeting Dll4 and notch; 6 ) CSF1R inhibitors could deplete macrophages and reduce resistance to anti-VEGF Therapy 7) demonstration of significant activity of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in low-grade ovarian cancers and initiation of an international phase III trial of another potent MEK inhibitor trametinib; 8) development of a robust biomarker panel that predicts response to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and initiation of multiple trials combining PI3K and PARP inhibitors in high-grade ovarian cancer; and 9) use of mesenchymal stem cells to deliver interferon to ovarian cancers. I n t h i s new SPORE application, 4 projects will strive to: 1) validate predictive biomarkers and implement rational combination therapy with PARP inhibitors designed to overcome pre- existing and adaptive resistance; 2) validate predictive biomarkers and implement rational combination therapy with MEK inhibitor for low-grade ovarian serous cancers to overcome resistance; 3) target macrophages to overcome resistance to anti-VEGF therapies; and 4) evaluate a novel SIK2 inhibitor in a Phase IA/B trial and identify agents that produce synthetic lethality."
"9348548","Abstract  Cancer patients treated with many widely used chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel (PAC) and oxaliplatin (OXA), frequently develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) that may lead to dose reduction, dosing schedule changes and termination of treatment. In some patients, acute peripheral neuropathy (PN) can transition into chronic PN lasting well beyond termination of chemotherapy. Currently, there are no drugs to prevent CIPN and the therapeutic ?off-label? use of existing analgesics is not effective. Recent evidence suggests that a member of the thermo-sensitive TRP ion channel family is responsible for pain generation arising from the affected sensory neurons. We have identified the transient receptor potential, subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1), as a promising target for novel analgesic drugs to treat or prevent CIPN. TRPA1 is activated by noxious cold and ROS, consistent with rapidly induced cold allodynia symptoms found in CIPN patients. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel therapeutic approach based a new molecular mechanism that targets this key molecule involved in acute and chronic responses to CIPN. We propose to develop a novel, therapeutic small molecule functional antagonist of TRPA1 for the treatment of CIPN. TRPA1 receptor-channels serve a highly specific function on sensory nerve fiber endings that detect and transmit the sensations of pain and hyperalgesia in response to nerve injury. PAC or OXA treatment induces upregulation and sensitization of TRPA1. Our preliminary in vivo data shows that TRPA1 antagonists reverse neuropathic pain behaviors in a translational paclitaxel-CIPN model. The overall goal is to develop a TRPA1 antagonist delivered in combination with either PAC or OXA that is effective in blocking TRPA1 activation during CIPN. Our studies will first determine the potency and efficacy of TRPA1 antagonists to inhibit PAC- and OXA- induced activation in cultured DRG neurons. Second, the pharmacokinetics of three TRPA1 antagonists will be determined to enable dose selection for in vivo efficacy studies. Third, dose-response profiles for TRPA1 antagonists will be determined in translational rat PAC- and OXA-CIPN models using acute and chronic dosing. The final aim is to determine if a TRPA1 antagonist administered before and during PAC or OXA dosing can prevent induction of CIPN. The final Phase 1 milestone is to deliver an advanced preclinical candidate having pharmacological properties necessary for a full development program in Phase 2."

The Center is a collaborative effort within multiple NCCU units and will be housed at the Julius L. Chambers Biomedical/Biotechnology Research Institute (BBRI). Focusing on basic and behavioral biomedical research, the Center will leverage resources and partnerships at the neighboring institutions in the Research Triangle area, community based organizations and the nationwide RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) to advance the following specific aims: (1) Enhance the research capacity of NCCU within the areas of basic biomedical and behavioral research by conducting three innovative and significant research projects; and developing a strong research infrastructure core and community engagement core where investigators will have access to the tools for basic/biomedical and behavioral sciences; (2) Prepare and enable all levels of investigators (including postdocs, research track, tenure-track and tenured faculty) to become successful extramurally funded health disparities researchers by developing an Investigator Development Core (IDC) and providing funding for pilot projects focused on health disparities research with robust mentoring by an experienced investigator from NCCU and/or partnering institutions; (3) Provide ancillary activities and promote a collaborative environment conducive to career enhancement by offering a multitude of career enhancement activities and collaborative events; and (4) establish sustainable relationships with neighboring research and community-based organizations and RTRN network to advance cutting edge health disparities research at NCCU. Leveraging the existing biomedical commitment of NCCU and establishing such an integrated RCMI Center at NCCU will greatly enhance the research capacity at this HBCU and drive it towards achieving its mission of addressing health disparities."
"9567681","Protocol Review and Monitoring System ? Project Summary The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) oversees and ensures the scientific merit, appropriate resourcing and progress of all clinical studies at KUCC. KUCC received conditional approval of PRMS at the 2012 NCI site visit and have made multiple personnel and process changes since that time resulting in full approval in August 2016. The KUCC Clinical Trials Office (CTO) may support the Center's cancer clinical trials that are approved by the PRMS. The PRMS evaluation occurs prior to submission to the institutional review board called the Human Subjects Committee (HSC) and does not overlap with HSC responsibilities. The three components of the PRMS are the Disease Working Groups (DWG; reporting to Associate Director (AD) of Clinical Research; Carol Fabian, MD, 2016), the Executive Resourcing Committee (ERC; Stephen Williamson, MD, Chair, 2013, also reporting to AD of Clinical Research), and the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC; Qamar Khan, MD, Chair 2013, reporting to the Deputy Director). Although each component has a unique role, these are aligned to ensure protocols are efficiently moved through the system, receive high-quality peer-review and monitoring, and that the research portfolio is consistent with KUCC clinical research priorities. The DWGs, which meet monthly, are charged with initial review of clinical trial merit and feasibility, and with prioritizing by disease-site. Highest priority is given to investigator initiated peer-reviewed funded trial proposals. DWG co-chairs are appointed by the AD for Clinical Research. Although the DWG composition is rich in clinicians focused on treatment trials and primarily D3ET members, representatives of CPS and CCPH are also DWG members. DWGs with significant prevention and survivorship components have formal liaisons from CPS and CCPH, and this is likely to extend to CB in the future. To further increase interaction with KUCC programs and translational research, each DWG has one of their meetings per year replaced by a Clinical Translational Research Meeting focused on their area but chaired by the AD of Clinical Research with at least 1 basic or behavioral scientist presenting a relevant proposal or ongoing project along with 1-2 clinical projects. All KUCC members are invited and KUCC program leaders and ADs are expected to attend. DWGs are evaluated yearly by the AD for proportion of trials that are IIT and/or national, quality and translational nature of interventional trials, trial accrual, and national meeting presentations and publications. The ERC reviews protocol resource requirements, available funding, and alignment with KUCC research programs as defined by the Leadership Council (ADs and Program Leaders); CTO sends ERC approved studies to the PRMC for Scientific Review. The PRMC performs independent scientific merit and bio-statistical reviews, including rationale, design, statistical analysis plan, and adequacy of the data safety monitoring. The PRMC also monitors active protocols at least annually for continued scientific merit, clinical appropriateness, progress toward completion of scientific objectives, accrual status, and terminates studies as appropriate."
"9383795","PROJECT SUMMARY A major challenge common to understanding phenotypic diversity, modeling selection in evolution, and developing precision medicine is enhancing our currently limited ability to predict disease and phenotypic outcomes based on genome sequence and environmental exposures. A comprehensive understanding of genetic variation and its role in conditioning phenotypes requires systematic, perturbation-based testing of genetic variants across the genome in multiple environments and in an isogenic background. Previous systematic genome perturbation efforts have focused primarily on engineering loss-of-function, but naturally occurring variants have the most relevance to understanding medically relevant phenotypes like human traits and disease. Such variants have been studied via genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, but these approaches are limited to the haplotypes that appear in the study population, and only in few cases have the actual causative variants been identified. Advances in genome editing technologies have made engineering specific genetic variants feasible at a large scale. This proposal aims to systematically engineer and functionally profile a genome-wide `variation collection' in three genetically distinct strains that cover all natural single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae species as well as SNVs associated with human diseases. The collection will be constructed by a high-throughput CRISPR approach, leveraging an in-house sequence parsing technology (Recombinase Directed Indexing, or REDI) that will allow rapid, inexpensive isolation of sequence-verified variant strains among the millions that will be generated. Because some variants only exert their effects in certain environments, this strain collection will be profiled in hundreds of conditions, including exposure to various stresses and drugs. DNA barcodes integrated into the genome of each strain will enable pooled, competitive growth, and allow the comprehensive identification of variants in a genome that modulate fitness in a given condition in a single experiment. Finally, to dissect the genetic architecture of pathways underlying diseases and identify key interactions, strains carrying combinations of SNVs will be analyzed. The strain collection will be made available to the community for further phenotypic investigations. In addition to the gene x environment (GxE) dataset that will likely be the largest produced to date, the technological, analytical, and visualization pipelines will be publicly shared and integrated into community resources. This work will constitute an unprecedented investigation of the consequences of genetic variation and their dependence upon environment, while providing valuable resources for the scientific community. It will lay technological and conceptual groundwork for systematic perturbation-based studies of genetic variation in human cells that will inform the prediction of disease risk and the design of therapeutic strategies based on genome sequence."

Relationship building will be facilitated through community-university exchanges, community involvement in research prioritization and proposal review, and capacity-building opportunities for members of community-based organizations (CBO) that serve underrepresented groups, particularly Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders including Filipinos. Specific Aim 1. Nurture trust-based collaborative relationships with communities through capacity building and resource sharing. Plan: Strengthen relationships between university faculty and the extensive network of CBO partners (including local governmental agencies) through capacity-building and resource-sharing activities to improve the health of Native Hawaiians, other Pacific Islanders including Filipinos, immigrants, and groups marginalized because of their ethnicity, socioeconomic status, sexual preference or identity, or geographic location. Specific Aim 2. Promote and facilitate community participation in all aspects of health-disparities research. Plan: Foster community participation in conceptualization, design, planning and implementation of research that is relevant to community concerns, and engage CBO in the review of research proposals. Specific Aim 3. Disseminate research findings to the intended communities and service providers. Plan: Create a communications infrastructure to facilitate the rapid dissemination of easily understandable information on health promotion and disease prevention to the intended communities and through culturally appropriate, scientific venues. The proposed CEC action plans are expected to have a significant impact on creating sustainable university partnerships with CBO, on diversifying the ?thinkforce?, and on supporting the bidirectional flow of ideas to tackle the root causes of and effective interventions for health disparities."
"9557690","Project Summary  The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT, 1983-1993) compared intensive therapy aimed at near normal glycemia versus conventional therapy with no specific glucose targets in 1441 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) over a mean follow-up of 6.5 yrs. Intensive therapy reduced the risks of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy by 35-76%, hyperglycemia being a primary determinant of complications. We also described potential adverse effects of intensive therapy; assessed its effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, neurocognition and quality of life; and projected the lifetime health-economic impact. DCCT intensive therapy was then adopted world-wide as standard-of-care for T1DM.  The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and its Complications (EDIC, 1994-present) is the observational follow-up study of the DCCT cohort, with 94% of those surviving actively participating. Participants are evaluated annually. CVD events and deaths are carefully documented and adjudicated. EDIC has notably shown that the early beneficial effects of intensive versus conventional therapy on complications have persisted for more than 15 years despite the similar HbA1c levels in the two groups during EDIC, termed metabolic memory. Former intensive therapy also greatly reduced the risk of CVD events, advanced microvascular complications, such as chronic kidney disease and eye complications requiring surgery, and mortality. DCCT/EDIC collaborators have also conducted numerous ancillary studies with separate funding.  The overarching goals for the next 5 years (2017-22) will be to take advantage of the loyal and highly characterized DCCT/EDIC cohort and study the occurrence of physical and cognitive dysfunction and more advanced complications, and their risk factors, in this aging type 1 diabetes population. Since current-day diabetes therapy has increased the longevity of people with type 1 diabetes, it is critical to understand how aging affects patients with type 1 diabetes and to define the risk factors for the occurrence of aging sensitive deficits. In addition, the accrual of long-term severe complications will allow the study of their risk factors and the quality-of-life and health economic consequences.  The specific scientific aims are to 1) examine the prevalence of cognitive, affective, and physical impairments in T1DM, and the association of DCCT treatment arm, glycemia, and established and putative non-glycemic risk factors on important domains of aging: cognitive, affective and physical impairments, functional limitations, disability, quality-of-life, frailty, falls, fractures, and survival; 2) analyze the risk factors/mechanisms associated with severe/advanced microvascular complications; 3) analyze the risk factors/mechanisms associated with CVD and mortality; 4) develop new research approaches to measure the progression of diabetes outcomes (vectors) in T1DM, derived from the unique long-term, longitudinal follow-up of the DCCT cohort; and 5) study the long-term economic consequences of T1DM."

To achieve this goal, we will 1) Conduct innovative interdisciplinary research to understand the complex interactions between biological, behavioral and social factors associated with obesity-related health disparities throughout the life course (two full projects); 2) Partner with the community to inform research and disseminate evidence-based practices designed to result in individual, community and system-level changes to impact obesity-related health disparities. (Academic-Community Engagement and Dissemination Core- ACED); 3) Expand the pipeline of innovative research through an Investigator Development Program of mentored pilot research for early stage investigators. (Investigator Development Core ? IDC); and 4) Establish a coordinated infrastructure to support the proposed research, IDC and ACED Cores by: a) implementing a Common Data Elements and Measurement Shared Resource to be used by OHDRC researchers, b) designing career enhancement activities that focus on transdisciplinary obesity health disparities research to prepare independent investigators (especially those from underrepresented minority groups, in partnership with minority serving institutions) for productive careers, and c) instituting a monitoring and evaluation process to ensure achievement of proposed goals. (Administrative Core). Alabama is particularly well-suited as a setting to pursue these aims. It includes some of the most impoverished rural counties and inner-city communities in the nation and, as we will highlight, Alabamians suffer from some of the highest rates of obesity and from some of the most starkly disproportionate outcomes for obesity-related chronic diseases. If our OHDRC proves successful, we will serve as a model for other states facing similar health disparities."
"9548000","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The initiation of DNA synthesis and its regulation is a fundamental process of biology that impacts virtually every aspect of human health. Proper replication determines the fate of cells during early development and throughout adult life. DNA polymerases cannot synthesize DNA without a primer, and primase is the specialized RNA polymerase capable of de novo synthesis of short RNA primers during replication. In eukaryotes, primase functions within a heterotetrameric primase-DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) complex. This complex is uniquely capable of switching from the synthesis of RNA by primase to the synthesis of DNA by pol alpha. The synthesized RNA-DNA primer is required for further DNA synthesis by the major replicative DNA polymerases. In humans, the primase component consists of a small catalytic subunit (p49) and a large subunit (p58), and pol alpha is comprised of a catalytic subunit (p180) and an accessory subunit B (p70). The concerted actions of primase and pol alpha are critical for accurate genome duplication. Malfunction of primase-pol alpha complex causes global genome instability and is linked to the onset and progression of cancer and other diseases. Currently, the details for primase-pol alpha complex organization and function, including the mechanisms of unit size RNA primer synthesis and subsequent internal transfer to pol alpha are very limited. The goal of our project is to determine the structural basis of human primase-pol alpha complex function and reveal the biological consequences of alterations in this complex. To achieve our goal we will determine the mechanism of unit-length RNA primer synthesis and counting by human primase (Aim 1), the structural and functional consequences of primase integration into the pol alpha complex (Aim 2), and the mechanism of substrate switch from primase to pol alpha (Aim 3). Our studies will involve a variety of methods: X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), single molecule experiments, yeast two-hybrid and polymerase reactions assays. We also will examine the in vivo impact of mutations affecting primase-pol alpha activities on genome stability in a yeast model system."
"9346660","PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE PHARMACOLOGY CORE (CORE 1)  The ever-increasing and often non-disclosed use of natural products (NPs) raise concerns about natural  product-drug interactions (NPDIs) that, like drug-drug interactions (DDIs), may negatively impact therapeutic  outcomes. As with DDIs, the most common mechanisms underlying NPDIs include induction and inhibition of  drug metabolizing enzymes or transporters. Given the chemistry complexity of the many phytoconstituents,  the major issue with NPs is in identifying and isolating the perpetrating constituent(s) for mechanistic studies in  vitro and elucidating its (their) pharmacokinetics as an in vivo determinant of clinically relevant NPDIs in human  subjects. Hence, evaluating the drug interaction liability of a given NP requires a rigorous ?predict, learn, and  confirm? approach involving robust human-derived in vitro systems, dynamic modeling and simulation, and  clinical assessment. Dr. Paine, Co-PI and Pharmacology Core leader, has extensive investigative experience  in pharmacokinetic NPDIs using the aforementioned approach, and her UW Co-Investigators are international  leaders in the field of DDIs, who have developed state-the-the-art in vitro methods for studying DDIs mediated  by biotransformation enzymes and/or transport proteins. Their collective expertise will enable the  Pharmacology Core to develop a comprehensive and systematic approach for solving the scientific and  technical challenges in assessing the interaction potential and clinical relevance of NPDIs. The Pharmacology  Core is responsible for 1) selecting and prioritizing 4-6 natural products (NPs) for further investigation in the  Interaction Projects, and 2) developing detailed Statements of Work (SOWs) for the Interaction Projects. The  Pharmacology Core has developed an innovative NP selection strategy, which combines mechanistic and  practical considerations, along with input from the Analytical and Informatics Cores, that will enable  accomplishment of the first objective. As an illustration of this approach, a list of five priority NPs were  identified: cannabinoids (marijuana), green tea, St. John?s wort, 6?,7?-dihydroxybergottamin (DHB)  supplements, and milk thistle. The second objective will be accomplished by entering the approved NPs into  an assessment process guided by a three-part Decision Tree as outlined in the Research Strategy of the  Overall section. Some of the novel methods introduced into the Decision Trees include the newer human-  derived cell systems (e.g., cell lines expressing recombinant transporters), ?Phase 0? pharmacokinetic studies  with a candidate NP in healthy subjects, and use of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling. Based  on the systematic assessment, the Pharmacology Core will develop SOWs for the in vitro and in vivo studies of  the Interaction Projects. Thereafter, the Pharmacology Core will participate in the interaction Project Teams to  oversee the execution of the in vitro and clinical studies detailed in the SOWs, analyze the pharmacokinetic  data generated by the Analytical Core, and help in coordinating data transfer to the Informatics Core. Well-  designed and carefully executed NPDI studies will provide new standards for NPDI research."
"9408736","One of the most significant events in our lives is the birth of a child. At the same time, on average 20% of couples find difficulties conceiving within the first year of trying. In our society, historically, fertility issues are mostly associated with females' health. However, in 40%-50% of these cases male fertility issues may be at the source of the problem, while, typically, are much easier to treat. The fundamental evaluation of male fertility in the clinical laboratory begins with sperm characterization, where the golden standard is to use a benchtop microscope (manually) and/or a computer-assisted automated semen analysis (CASA) system. Though, partially due to cost and partially due to social stigma associated with clinical evaluation or treatment, male infertility often stays undetected. This has generated a demand for inexpensive in-home sperm evaluation kits. However, there is currently no product on the market that offers in-home and quantitative measurement of sperm count and motility ? parameters vital for interpretation of semen quality. This proposal aims to develop and commercialize a Lucendi Semen Performance Analytics (Lucendi SPA) platform. Lucendi SPA will be a rapid (<2 minutes), simple-to-use, inexpensive, compact, lightweight, and portable product for automated analysis of sperm characteristics ideal for repeated and continual testing of male fertility and wellness. Lucendi SPA will be designed based on a novel lens-free microscopy technology developed over the past decade at UCLA by Prof. Ozcan's lab. Lucendi SPA system will consist of a disposable cartridge (for single use) and a multi-use computational reader. Another component of the Lucendi SPA system will be a mobile/web application that tracks and quantifies user's sperm characteristics and quality over time, provides actionable feedback and easy to understand metrics, offers wellness and lifestyle suggestions for improvement of results and stimulates an overall healthy lifestyle, promoting wellness. With the relatively low cost of computational power, we believe that such a compact, light-weight and cost- effective automated semen analysis platform running on a wide-field lensfree on-chip microscope would be especially useful for in-home male fertility tests. Potential other application areas of this unique semen analysis platform are vast and include post-vasectomy tests either at home or in clinics, sperm analysis in fertility clinics (including IVF procedures), semen quality evaluation in sperm banks, stud performance assessment at animal breeding centers, and stud health monitoring in farms. In addition to these, by using a larger-area image sensor, this platform can also be transformed into a significantly higher throughput analysis platform that can measure sperms' response to different drugs or chemicals of various concentrations in parallel."
"9544350","Abstract The target users of the proposed Slicer+PLUS framework are researchers and developers who are focusing on low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) applications. POCUS applications are characterized by utilizing low-cost, portable U/S systems; in the hands of novice operators; with novel data acquisition, signal processing, and machine learning methods; with imprecise trackers; and in highly unconstrained point-of-care environments, e.g.: at the scene of accidents for patient triage, in the offices of general practitioners for scoliosis detection and monitoring, in patients' homes for an aging population, as well as throughout hospitals. In these contexts, many are considering POCUS devices to be the stethoscopes of the future.  The foundation of Slicer+PLUS is the integration and extension of 3D Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. We are the developers of these libraries. We, and the users of our libraries, are proposing Slicer+PLUS so that the Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC communities can come together and cohesively address the important challenges and opportunities posed by POCUS applications. Over 30 letters of support are included with this application.  3D Slicer is a world-class, freely available open-source platform for medical image segmentation, registration, and visualization. PLUS is a world-class, open-source library for communicating with ultrasound machines and trackers (for following objects in 3D using magnetic, optical, and other technologies). MUSiiC is a (previously closed source) library that focuses on advanced ultrasound acquisition and analysis methods, such as ultrasound reconstruction pipelines, elastography, and photoacoustic imaging. Together, these toolkits have averaged over 5,100 downloads per month for the past year.  A central tenant of our work is that POCUS applications should not be viewed as simply involving the use of inexpensive, portable U/S systems; POCUS must be viewed as a new modality for it to attain its full potential. POCUS must involve innovative, automated data analysis methods and workflows that can guide a user to properly place and manipulate an ultrasound probe and interpret the returned ultrasound data. In particular, the output of those workflows and analyses should be quantitative measures, not b-mode images, since the expertise to interpret such images will not be readily available at points-of-care. To that end, the proposed work goes well beyond simple integration of Slicer, PLUS, and MUSiiC. Multiple innovations are proposed such as Ultrasound Spectroscopy for tissue labeling, Dynamic Textures for anatomic localization of ultrasound probes, and self-tracking ultrasound probes.  To assess our progress towards our goals, our team includes our target users: researchers, medical device manufacturers, and clinical innovators dedicated to low-cost POCUS applications. They will be validating our efforts by integrating them into their research and translational POCUS product development projects."
"9353480","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT HIV testing is often shunned in community settings due to the stigma of HIV-centric services. Our recent pilot study strongly suggest that integration of a package of screening that include HIV, diabetes, and hypertension hold promise of substantially increasing the uptake of HIV testing while simultaneously providing direly needed community screening for non-communicable disease (NCDs) like diabetes and hypertension, which themselves are at epidemic levels in Sub-Saharan Africa. In our pilot study we found that HIV testing almost doubled when diabetes and hypertension screening was added. Moreover, once HIV-infected individuals are identified, many are reluctant to enter care due to the stigma of HIV-centric care programs, and over time attrition of clients is a serious problem undermining the clinical and public health benefits of these programs. Our preliminary studies strongly suggest that integration of NCD care within HIV care would increase enrollment and retention in HIV care by destigmatizing the clinics for all attendees, and by providing tangible clinical therapies for the estimated 79% of HIV-infected clients who also have NCDs, especially those waiting to become eligible for ART, who are also those with the highest attrition. We will assess: (a) the client characteristics and patterns of utilization at the 6 HIV Care and Treatment Centers (CTCs) in Kisarawe District, Tanzania; (b) trends in HIV testing; (c) history of HIV intervention (d) census data; (e) conduct community mapping in each CTC?s catchment area; (f) consult with community leaders and Medical Officers , and (g) match two similar CTCs . Next, one of the two CTCs will be randomized as an enhanced intervention site. At both CTCs we will conduct community mobilization to alert community of available services. At the enhanced intervention CTC we will also provide screening for diabetes and hypertension. The Health Center (always adjacent to the CTC) will be assisted with treating positive NCD cases. HIV-infected clients will be referred to the CTC at both sites, and the first 89 patients at each CTC will be enrolled in a cohort and followed for 24- months (total N=178 across 2 clinics). Those in the cohort at the enhanced intervention CTC who are NCD positive will have care for NCDs integrated with their HIV care. We will assess how NCD screening affects uptake of HIV testing at the community-level over ~18-months. We will establish whether adding NCD care to HIV care improves linkage and enrollment in HIV care. We will determine if retention in HIV care among newly enrolled clients is enhanced over 24-months with the addition of NCD care. We will then cost all intervention components to determine the incremental cost per added client tested for HIV, enrolled in HIV care, and retained in HIV care by adding NCD screening and care."
"9561219","Project Summary/Abstract: Trace Elements (TE) Shared Resource  The Trace Element (TE) Shared Resource is a specialized facility dedicated to determining trace element  concentration, and form of trace elements, in a wide variety of biological and environmental media. The  chemistry of inorganic elements inextricably is linked with the study of cancer. Whether determining the fate  and effects of known carcinogens (such as arsenic), the potential antagonistic effects of elements (such as  selenium), or the therapeutic effects of platinum or Fe nanoparticles, there is a clear need for routine advanced  trace element analytical methods to support cancer research. The critical nature of these services for the  Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) research program has led to designation of TE as an NCCC-supported  Shared Resource and to a request for future CCSG funding. In the TE core, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass  Spectrometry (ICP-MS) methodologies have been developed to provide analysis of trace metals in solids,  solution, blood, and toenails. TE services include arsenic speciation in solutions, mercury speciation in  solution, and ICP-MS tuning and operation for routine analysis. There have been notable examples of cancer  research using TE resources. For example, the TE core developed innovative methods for determining  Arsenic species in rice, juice, and toddler formulae. Also TE-developed spatial analyses show the distribution  of a trace element within tissue sections, which is determined 'in situ' at pre-determined resolution, creating a  2-dimensional elemental image map from biological thin sections using laser ablation-ICP-MS. Using this  technology, the TE core developed methods for detecting Fe, Cu, and Zn in rat brain sections. Analytical  expertise is provided by the TE Core Director and a staff consisting of a PhD level scientist and an advanced  Research Technician. The TE core has collaborated with NCCC researchers in 5 of the NCCC Programs  (Cancer Epidemiology, Cancer Mechanisms, Molecular Therapeutics, Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology, and  Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy) to determine the concentration or form of trace elements in biological  samples."
"9455959","PROJECT SUMMARY Synthetic biologists develop tools and approaches to endow microorganisms with novel attributes and behaviors, as well as the ability to synthesize novel products. There have been few reports, however, wherein bacteria serve as components of devices created to transmit biological information to and from electronic devices. Information flow between biological systems and electronic devices is complicated by the fact that most of biological function is mediated by molecular or ionic cues, while devices are programmed by electrons and photons. Technologies that have facilitated the bio/device intersection have changed our lives (e.g., EKG). Our objective is to rewire bacteria to serve as information translators and to do this in a way that facilitates understanding of human health. The human gastrointestinal microbiome, often viewed as a complex organ itself, influences homeostasis and is implicated in many human diseases. GI tract geometry is complex and its microenvironments are widely varied. pH and oxygen levels exist from the most acidic to neutral, and from completely anaerobic to oxygen saturation levels, respectively. There are few methodologies that enable resolution of its signaling, cell growth, and chemical environments even at the macro length scale. In the last several years however, researchers have developed micro and meso systems for interrogating GI tract biology. Capsular endoscopy has enabled first-of-kind remote imaging. At the microscale, organ or animal-on-a-chip methodologies provide first-of-their kind access to biological function in user-controlled conditions. Both methodologies will open new avenues for diagnosis and treatment of human disease. Both methodologies, however, lack the ability to interrogate and modulate biological signaling at cellular length scales and in real time. The proposed studies will enlist synthetic biology to create `smart' hydrogels for interrogating molecular space. The innovation of this proposed study is the development of `biological lithography', where polyelectrolyte polysaccharides, doped with redox responsive catechols, will be layered with engineered cells for an expanded repertoire of molecular recognition and information transfer. Importantly, fabrication methodologies are simple and biologically benign so that these sensing materials can be assembled in situ in minutes and with no added mechanical equipment. To date, in vitro devices at both micro and meso scale do not provide molecular information at the length and time scales of the cells they interrogate. The significance of this work is its complementarity to animal-on-a-chip systems, capsular endoscopy devices, and other methodologies that have great promise for advancing diagnosis and treatment of disease but that lack access to molecular cues and information transfer."
"9317695","Abstract: Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is a bone marrow-derived malignancy and remains a clinical challenge, with long-term survival of approximately 50%. Improvements in AML therapy have predominantly come through better supportive care and the improvements in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, rather than improved chemotherapy approaches. This plateauing in AML survival points to a need for better, targeted therapies. Part of the difficulty with developing novel treatments to AML is that it is a heterogeneous disease, with well over 250 different mutated genes, although any one patient has on average 13 somatic mutations. Thus, developing a ?unifying genetic signature? that drives AML remains elusive. To understand how mutations found in AML contribute to leukemia development, we have chosen to focus on mutations in genes encoding the cohesin complex. Cohesin mutations occur in approximately 10-20% of patients, but its role in leukemogenesis is unknown. Our preliminary data demonstrate that cohesin loss causes increased self- renewal in wild-type murine bone marrow, a hallmark of leukemia development. Interestingly, this increased self-renewal is augmented in Npm1+/- after cohesin loss. While Npm1 mutations are the most common single gene mutation in AML, Npm1-mutated mice rarely develop AML, implying additional mutations are required. In both wild-type (WT) and Npm1-mutated bone marrow, cohesin loss causes epigenetic derepression of the self- renewal associated transcription factor HoxA9. Given that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates trimethylation of Histone 3 on Lysine 27 (H3K27me3), normally silences HoxA9 epigenetically we hypothesize that cohesin haploinsufficiency promotes AML by derepressing PRC2 target genes. The goal of this proposal is to use a combination of genome-wide approaches and genomic editing to determine the mechanism by which cohesin mutations induce abnormal self-renewal and promote leukemia development. In Aim 1 we will use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify changes in PRC2 genomic localization after cohesin loss. In Aim 2, we will use circular chromosomal conformational capture (4C) to identify which distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are normally recruited to regulate HoxA9 expression, and the changes in distal CREs after cohesin loss. In Aim 3 we will further characterize both in vitro and in vivo the effects of cohesin depletion on WT and Npm1cA/+ bone marrow. Also in Aim 3, we will test the role of the histone methyltransferase Dot1l loss/inhibition in preventing HoxA9 expression and cohesin-depletion associated self-renewal. Collectively, the long-term goal of our studies is to develop a novel mouse model of AML based upon loss of cohesin in Npm1cA AML, a combination of mutations that represents a sizeable fraction of patients with AML. In addition, we will use this model to address mechanistic question regarding how altered targeting of epigenetic complexes can cause disordered gene expression and leukemogenesis."
"9539088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Framingham Osteoporosis Study (R01 AR41398 Risk Factors for Age Related Bone Loss), an ancillary study of the Framingham Heart Study, has contributed significantly over the past 25 years to the understanding of genetic and lifestyle factors contributing to osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and fractures. Based on the growing epidemic of obesity, and conflicting data regarding the role of visceral adiposity on musculoskeletal health, in this continuation of the Framingham Osteoporosis Study, we will determine the role of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) on bone density, microarchitecture, and strength, as well as on muscle density, and fracture. We are proposing three aims. In Aim 1, to determine the association between VAT and bone density, microarchitecture, and strength, we will measure VAT using longitudinal whole body DXA scans (a baseline previously obtained, and a follow up to be acquired as part of this project) and perform High Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) measurements of the distal radius and tibia, and during a clinic visit of the Framingham Study 3rd Generation Cohort (Gen3). In Aim 2 we will determine the association of VAT and muscle density using longitudinal QCT scans already obtained in the Gen3 Cohort. For both Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will also determine if the effects of VAT on bone density, microarchitecture and strength (Aim 1), and on muscle density (Aim 2), are partly attributable to physical activity levels, inflammation, adipokines, or sex steroid metabolism. In Aim 3, we will perform a Mendelian randomization analysis to obtain an unbiased estimate of the VAT-fracture association by using a genetic risk score (instrumental variable) to predict incident fracture. The proposed study will be the largest investigation of the potentially deleterious effects of visceral adiposity on the musculoskeletal system. Each of our hypotheses is based on preliminary data from our past grant cycle or from other research grants involving the Framingham Study. The project is significant for several reasons. First, obesity has become one of the most important health problems in the U.S. Second, the precise role of visceral adiposity on the musculoskeletal system has not been previously investigated, and the proposed work will fill this gap, especially with longitudinal data on VAT and to be obtained longitudinal measures of muscle density using existing CT scans. Third, we will investigate potential underlying mechanisms for the effects of VAT on the musculoskeletal system. Finally we will obtain an unbiased estimate of the VAT-fracture association using Mendelian randomization analysis. Overall, the results of this study will provide the best available data on the effects of visceral adiposity on the musculoskeletal system."
"9464875","Summary The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate a unique imaging application of renal clearable near infrared-emitting gold nanoparticles (NIR-emitting AuNPs) in the early detection of drug- induced kidney injuries in the preclinical settings. Our central hypothesis is that efficient renal clearance and strong NIR-emission of the AuNPs we recently invented will allow us to detect drug-induced kidney injuries rapidly and noninvasively at early stages that very few conventional fluorescent contrast agents can do. As a proof of concept, we will use cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, to induce dose-dependent kidney injuries in a CD-1 mouse model, quantify the biocompatibility of NIR-AuNPs to CD-1 mice with kidney injuries, and noninvasively stage drug-induced kidney injury using in vivo fluorescence imaging technique. Success of this application will enable ClearNano Inc. to have unique competitiveness in contrast agent market as well as help pharma and biotech companies to evaluate potential nephrotoxicity of drug candidates at a lower cost."
"9448754","Project Summary/Abstract The degree of behavioral control that an organism (rodent to human) can exert over an adverse event is one of the most potent variables yet discovered that modulates the behavioral and neurochemical impact of that event. When the organism does have an element of control, the behavioral and neurochemical sequelae of the adverse event are blunted or eliminated. Importantly, the experience of control not only blunts the impact of the stressor being controlled, but also blunts the impact of stressors experienced much later (at least two months in rat), that is, control produces future resilience in the face of adversity. The research to be conducted in this proposal will be directed at investigating the neural circuits by which the prefrontal cortex mediates the stress-buffering effects of coping/control. Specific Aims will examine the precise prefrontal circuits involved in the separable features of behavioral control: (a) the detection of control and (b) the subsequent use of that information to regulate stress-responsive systems accordingly. In addition, over the last grant period we have extended the study of controllability phenomena to females, and surprisingly, here control does not blunt the impact of stress. The proposed research focuses on the roles of specific prefrontal cortex circuits in mediating the effects of control on stress resilience, as well as a determination of exactly how critical prefrontal circuits may respond to stressors differently in males and females."
"9532411","DESCRIPTION:  KSHV is etiologically associated with chronic inflammation associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion B-cell lymphoma (PEL) in oral and other body sites that occur in HIV-1 infected patients. The inflammatory response is one of the key elements of KSHV pathogenesis. KS lesions are characterized by inflammatory cells and cytokines. The KS lesion endothelial cells and B-cell lines from PEL carry multiple copies of the KSHV genome in a latent state. Our long term goals are to elucidate KSHV's interactions with the host innate response during primary infection and latency, the pathways of cytokine induction and to define their role in KSHV pathogenesis. Our rationale is that such detailed knowledge is crucial for designing therapeutic strategies to control KSHV infection, inflammation and the associated malignancies.  KSHV infected cells secrete multi-functional IL-1 and IL-18 cytokines into the supernatants. IL-1 and IL-18 are synthesized as inactive proIL-1 and proIL-18 and then undergo processing by activated caspase-1. However, caspase-1 itself is synthesized as a procaspase-1 and undergoes activation leading into an auto- proteolytic cleavage. Procaspase-1 activation is mediated by a molecular platform called an inflammasome that is formed by homotypic interactions of a sensor protein recognizing the danger trigger, an adaptor ASC molecule, and procaspase-1. Our studies have demonstrated that the pathogen sensing functions of the inflammasome also extends into the nucleus. During de novo KSHV infection of human microvascular dermal endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells, gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IFI16) is colocalized with the KSHV genome in the infected endothelial cell nucleus, and interacted with ASC and procaspase-1 to form an inflammasome complex. IFI16 also colocalized with the KSHV genome in the nuclei of latently infected endothelial and PEL cells, and only the IFI16 dependent inflammasome is constitutively activated in KSHV latently infected cells. Human KS and PEL lesions showed evidence of IFI16-ASC inflammasome activation. Constitutive induction of the IFI16-inflammasome was also observed in ?1-EBV latency I, II and III cells. Together with the ability of KSHV and EBV latency in the presence of the IFI16-inflammasome and association of IFI16 with KSHV and EBV genome in the latently infected cells, we hypothesize that IFI16 is involved in the innate sensing of foreign episomal DNA in the nucleus and KSHV utilizes IFI16 for its latency. This hypothesis will be tested by three innovative and interlinked specific aims.  These studies are significant since such elucidation wil lead into designing therapeutic strategies to control KSHV induced inflammation and the associated malignancies. These will also profoundly enhance the current concepts of innate sensing in the nucleus and will lead into new technologies and treatments that will benefit not only the KSHV area of research but also other fields."
"9484514","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The elimination of health disparities in Arkansas is an elusive goal because the state's African American  population is disproportionately burdened by chronic disease. To address this issue, the state needs, in part, a  diverse and highly productive research workforce completing research that can be translated into policies,  programs, and environments that reduce disparities and promote health equity. Studies suggest that early  stage investigators (ESIs) are most productive when provided with structured support (e.g., mentorship,  professional development opportunities, opportunities to collect preliminary data to support extramural grant  applications) and that these effects are particularly notable among ESIs who are members of health disparity  groups that are underrepresented in science. Thus, the proposed Investigator Development Core (IDC) of the  Arkansas Center for Health Disparities will build upon the substantial success of our Exploratory Center of  Excellence by including a multilevel model of support and professional development for ESIs who will conduct  translatable research that benefits socially disadvantaged African American Arkansans. The overarching goal  of the IDC is to expand opportunities for ESIs to engage in multidisciplinary and multilevel minority  health and health disparities research that examines chronic disease disparities among socially  disadvantaged African American populations. This goal will be achieved through implementation of a pilot  studies program that provides structured mentorship (via on- and off-campus mentorship collaborations) while  supporting the generation of preliminary data and, subsequently, dissemination of results and submission of  extramural grant applications. The IDC will adapt and implement an established pilot project program; provide  advisory and technical-support resources for rigorous research design and appropriate statistical analyses; and  implement a program of multisource team mentorship for pilot project researchers. These efforts are expected  to result in: increased recruitment, retention and advancement of ESIs conducted health disparities research  within the Center's thematic focus; and increased health disparities research that informs health policy and  program design to reduce disparities."
"9370328","ABSTRACT Project #3: Ubiquitin E3 ligases in SSc  Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a progressive multi-organ system fibrotic disorder associated with  autoimmunity. The leading causes of SSc-related death are pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and  interstitial lung disease (ILD). PAH affects 10-15% of SSc patients. The prevalence of ILD varies  from 40 to 65% in cohort studies. SSc-ILD is the subject of CORT Project #3. Common to many of  the SSc disease phenotypes, include the skin and the lung, is the observation that fibroblasts, the  principal effector cells of fibrosis, assume the contractile myofibroblast phenotype, synthesize matrix,  and exhibit a pathologically increased lifespan. A traditional approach to discover novel genes  involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis has been to perform genome-wide screening to  uncover dysregulated RNA species that may be involved in the pathogenesis of disease. However,  this approach may miss the critical role of proteins that are NOT regulated at the level of  transcription but rather through protein degradation, particularly through the ubiquitin-proteasome  system (UPS) mediated by ubiquitin E3 enzymes. Our recent studies using a large number of  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and SSc lung samples have uncovered an array of several,  previously unsuspected, molecular targets. In particular, we have identified two highly novel pro-  fibrotic signaling pathways in SSc fibroblasts: First is the loss of a new collagen 1 gene repressor, E2  transcriptional factor 8 (E2F8) by a ubiquitin E3 ligase, Fbxo16. This ultimately leads to increased  collagen synthesis in SSc fibroblasts. The second is a new protein isoform, termed FIEL1 (Fibrosis-  Inducing E3 Ligase 1), which potently stimulates the central pro-fibrotic cytokine, TGF?, signaling  pathway through the site-specific ubiquitination and degradation of the TGF? inhibitor PIAS4. Further,  we have developed a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor towards FIEL1 that is highly effective in  ameliorating fibrosis in mice. Thus, we hypothesize that dysregulation of members of E3  ubiquitin ligase system drives the fibrotic phenotype in SSc. In this project, we propose to  screen SSc-ILD lungs and lung fibroblasts derived from SSc-ILD lungs for dysregulated expression of  members of the SCF- and HECT-domain ubiquitin E3 ligases and to assay their function in mediating  the pathologic myofibroblast phenotype. We will then design small molecule inhibitors for these E3  ligases and test them for effectiveness in animal models of lung fibrosis as well as our unique ex vivo  diseased human lung perfusion and culture systems here at the University of Pittsburgh. These  proposed studies will help us discover a new set of potentially druggable targets underlying the  pathobiology of fibrotic pathways in SSc. These studies will provide a fundamental platform for a  unique and potentially transformative initiative in SSc-ILD. Our project will interact very closely with the  other CORT projects and cores to discover the overlapping biology of dysregulated ubiquitin E3  ligases in SSc-PAH and SSc-skin disease."
"9310857","Project Summary/Abstract The bacterial chemotaxis system is the best-studied example of two-component signaling systems, a signal transduction motif that is widespread in prokaryotes and also found in some eukaryotes. The absence of two-component systems in mammals, and their importance for regulation of medically relevant phenomena such as biofilm formation of pathogenic microbes, make them potential targets for novel antibiotics. Additional important features in the chemotaxis system include the formation of large (~ 200 nm) membrane-bound hexagonal arrays of receptors that integrate signals to regulate the central kinase CheA. Successful approaches for interrogating receptor structure and mechanism within the these arrays it forms with CheA and CheW will be applicable to other large multi-protein machines that operate in cells. It is widely accepted that attractant binding to receptors causes a subtle conformational change in the periplasmic and transmembrane domains, but it is less clear how this exerts its inverse effects on activities of the cytoplasmic domain: inhibition of the CheA kinase and stimulation of receptor methylation. This project will investigate signal propagation through the cytoplasmic domain to CheA using native-like arrays of the E. coli Asp receptor cytoplasmic fragment (CF), CheA, and CheW assembled on vesicle templates or with molecular crowding agents. Biochemical assays and electron cryotomography are critical to the preparation of these homogeneous, native-like arrays in defined signaling states. Solid-state NMR distance measurements will measure CF dimer-dimer distances to measure the structure of the trimer of dimers and the proposed expansion of the membrane-proximal region during signaling. A novel combination of vesicle assembly of functional complexes with hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry will test proposals that regulated subdomain dynamics propagate the signal down to the tip of the receptor, and that changes in CheA domain dynamics limit or enhance productive interactions with the active site to control kinase activity. These studies will yield key insights into the molecular mechanism of transmembrane signaling by bacterial chemotaxis receptors to control the activity of the associated kinase CheA, and will also develop and demonstrate approaches for investigating how proteins operate in the large complexes that they form in the cell."

"9380089","Abstract Hot flashes negatively impact 80% or more of the female population experiencing menopause due to aging and/or diagnosis and treatment for breast cancer, causing decreases in both emotional and physical role functioning. The most effective treatment for hot flashes, estrogen based treatment, is either contraindicated or a cause for worry amongst many women due to cancer and serious side effect risks. Some non-estrogen based treatments have been found effective, but they also can have a negative risk-benefit ratio. Effective, non-hormonal treatments for hot flashes that are not associated with unwanted side effects and are accessible to all women are needed. Hypnotic relaxation therapy is a mind-body intervention that has demonstrated the ability to reduce hot flashes in women experiencing menopause from natural aging as well as breast cancer treatment and has recently been added to a clinical guideline for hot flash management by the North American Menopause Society. However, access to this effective treatment is limited by a lack of trained and/or certified licensed providers. According to an IOM report on women?s health, efforts are needed to be able to translate effective guideline based treatments broadly into practice. This study represents the next step to meet that critical objective. This application proposes a multi-site, two arm, randomized controlled trial with 224 postmenopausal women to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate efficacy of a fully self- administered hypnosis compared to an equivalently structured attention control group; 2) Evaluate efficacy of the self-administered hypnosis compared to structured attention for sleep, mood, and hot flash related quality of life, and 3) Explore potential mechanisms by assessing mediators and moderators of effectiveness. This research has the potential to be the gateway to the broad dissemination of a powerful intervention against hot flashes and to illuminate mechanisms of action upon which to build further interventions. This study is innovative because it seeks to deliver a provider intensive therapy in a fully self-administered way, and to explore mechanisms by which it reduces hot flashes."

"9366122","Computational modeling have become a routine and powerful strategy for academic research and clinical care. Consequently, significant scientific discoveries were made, innovative products were launched, and individualized delivery of healthcare has become a possibility. The scientific and clinical domain of knee biomechanics is no exception. The knee is a major site of orthopaedic problems resulting in annual physician visits on the order of tens of millions. Modeling and simulation offers a cost-effective and prompt path to respond to the pressing medical needs for restoration of knee function. However, the reproducibility of simulation results, to inform scientific and clinical decision making, is questionable. Reproducibility is a pressing issue in scientific conduct. For modeling and simulation, there is added scrutiny particularly with the desire to repurpose and reuse virtual specimens for prospective solutions of diverse scientific and clinical problems. A significant portion of modeling and simulation workflow includes model development, evaluation, and simulation. This workflow, while based on objective scientific principles, commonly requires intuition during implementation; therefore relies on the knowledge and expertise of the modeler. This ?art of modeling? can be a fundamental source of diminished reproducibility. The goal of this study is to understand how modelers? choices to build models, even when using the same data, may influence predictions and therefore the reproducibility of simulation results. Five modeling and simulation teams will independently develop computational models of knees based on the same data sets and simulate the same scenarios, which are relevant to scientific and clinical understanding of knee biomechanics. Ideally, predicted joint and tissue mechanics will be the same. In practice, the skills and experiences of model developers will reflect upon their modeling choices; and as a result, discrepancies will exist. The proposed activity will document the magnitude and potential sources of such discrepancies through comparisons of model components and simulation results. This project will examine and critique the current state of model development and simulation reproducibility in joint and tissue mechanics. This will translate into reliable models of the knee joint for simulation-based discoveries and in silico design and evaluation of medical devices and interventions. The required exchange of data, model components, and simulation results among the teams and with the public will also impact developers and users of such resources. Specifications, to facilitate data and model exchange and to develop data and modeling standards, and guidance, to inform modeling and simulation workflows, will likely emerge as by-products of the research activity. The investigators are leaders in simulation-based explorations of knee biomechanics and include representatives of prominent research laboratories and clinical institutions worldwide. With this project, they will establish the necessary scientific rigor to recognize computational modeling and simulation as a dependable component of knee research and the joint's clinical care."
"9219682","Project Summary/Abstract Current pre-operative and intraoperative margin assessment techniques fail to adequately guide breast cancer surgeons to remove all cancer during breast conserving surgeries. As a result, 20-40% of lumpectomy patients have unrecognized tumor left in the tumor bed during the initial surgery. This residual tumor is only discovered when the pathologist evaluates the resection margins after surgery and finds a positive margin. The majority of patients with positive margins (~87%) require a second surgery, which increases health care costs along with patient anxiety and discomfort. To address this unmet need, Lumicell has developed an intraoperative imaging system consisting of a molecular imaging agent (LUM015) that emits fluorescence after activation by cancer associated enzymes, a compact hand-held imaging head (LUM 2.6 Device) that captures the fluorescence emission of the agent and software that detects and displays invasive carcinomas (80% of the breast cancer cases) in real-time to guide the surgeon. We, at the Massachusetts General Hospital, are conducting a feasibility study in breast cancer patients under an FDA-approved IDE. The first part of the feasibility study has been completed with no adverse events observed in 15 patients. Initial results from the feasibility study show no false negatives (100% sensitivity) with ~10% false positives. During this study, an approach for detecting the much smaller foci of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; 20% of breast cancer cases) was developed. As the first aim of this proposal, the team will develop and implement software for real-time detection of DCIS. The second aim is a two arm, multi-institution pivotal clinical trial in support of our PMA application to measure the efficacy of the LUM Imaging System. The primary endpoint of the study is the reduction in positive margin rates for surgeries in which the LUM Imaging System is used versus standard of care (SOC) treatment for breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving lumpectomies. The secondary endpoint is a reduction in the rate of second surgeries for positive margins when the LUM Imaging System is used. The two arms of the study will consist of a control arm and a device arm. The control arm will include 100 patients, while the device arm will include 300 patients. In the control arm, patients will undergo a routine lumpectomy procedure. In the device arm, patients will undergo a routine lumpectomy procedure followed by imaging of the lumpectomy cavity with the LUM Imaging System. Additional therapeutic cavity shaves will be removed from regions that LUM Imaging System determines to contain cancer."
"9408288","Project Summary/Abstract Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop a handheld two-photon microscopy (TPM) probe that will enable in vivo diagnosis and screening of various diseases, including cancers. This novel, clinically usable TPM instrument will provide three-dimensional (3-D) sub-micron resolution images of tissue pathology in situ. The images generated based on the two-photon excitation signals of intrinsic bio-molecules, such as the two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) of endogenous fluorophores and the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of collagen, will render important morphological and molecular information specific to various pathologies. Noninvasive optical biopsy based on two-photon microscopy is considered as the next-generation technology for disease diagnosis and has already been investigated in many pre-clinical studies. However, a suitable clinical TPM instrument has not yet been demonstrated, which is largely due to the technical and cost barriers in developing such a sought-after system. These include difficulty in transmitting high-power broadband femtosecond pulses from the bulky laser to a hand-held probe through a flexible fiber cord; challenges in miniaturizing the imaging probe with no sacrifice of imaging performance; and the high cost of the ultrafast laser source needed for efficient excitation of the nonlinear optical processes. Therefore, this R&D program directly addresses these barriers to widespread clinical use of TPM for noninvasive pathology. A laboratory prototype will be developed in the Phase I to demonstrate feasibility, while further optimization, advanced engineering and clinical testing will be performed in Phase II. Innovative technologies, including the development of a specialty fiber module for delivery of high-power ultrashort pulses and generation of a coherent supercontinuum (SC) based on the fiber-delivered laser pulses, as well as novel technological approaches for building a compact light-weight imaging probe, are being proposed. This will be possible by leveraging the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of investigators from PSI, with a proven track record on developing the next generation clinical devices, a leading research group from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and experienced clinical researchers and pathologists from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

"9410414","PROJECT SUMMARY As the cancer drug industry suffers from the lowest success rate in developing cancer-cure drugs, cell migration assessment assays that evaluate the transition of cells from a benign to a metastatic phenotype have gained more attention. Given the fact that metastatic cancer cells are substantially harder to eradicate than those that are benign, migratory propensity is now understood to be a key metric in both assessing cell migration behavior and screening anti-migratory compounds. However, conventional cell migration assays suffer from high cost of equipment, labor-intensive procedures and non-biomimetic culture environment. In addition, high-throughput, real-time quantification of collective cell migration requires live-cell microscopic monitoring that requires expensive microscope systems and fluorescent cell labeling for automatic tracking. Also, most conventional cell migration assays are performed on flat culture surfaces which lack topographical or mechanical cues necessary to provoke a metastatic phenotype and induce fast, directed collective cell migration observed during in vivo metastasis. The proposed cell migration assay platform incorporating anisotropic nanopatterned polymer substrates provides a more robust alternative to chemotactic systems. Enhanced biomimicry in this culture environment will enhance response sensitivity of the migrating cancer tissues in presence of test compounds, yielding a more predictive assay. In this proposed platform, we propose to integrate unique ion-permeable nanotopographic polymer substrates with a label free, impedance-based interdigitated electrode array (IEA) biosensor for detecting real-time quantification of collective cell migration in a high-throughput manner. We hypothesize that changes in IEA impedance magnitude can be reproducibly correlated to the migration distance, enabling real-time calculation of migratory velocity of the collective cell cultures. We further predict that such a relationship will permit the evaluation of dynamic, nanotopographically- guided tissue responses to anti-migratory agents. Finally, we anticipate that, aided by the proposed platform's biomimetic nanotopography, this system will significantly outperform prior art in its predictive capacity in evaluating cell migration kinetics. To test these hypotheses, single and multi-well unpatterned and nanopatterned IEA sensors will be fabricated and integrated with a simple, custom-made impedance analyzer. Reproducible correlations will be established between collective cellular migration distance and sensor impedance. Once this correlation is established, the IEA sensor will be used to test a series of pharmaceutical compounds through cellular migration assays. Lastly, nanopatterned culture data obtained through this project will be compared to scientific literature data to further evaluate the predictive utility of the proposed nanoIEA platform. Successful validation of this nanoIEA system will clear the way for the commercialization of a product that stands to advance the efficacy of preclinical cancer drug screening, thereby significantly leading to streamlined drug development."
"9444240","Project 3 - Modeling and theory-Abstract One of the greatest challenges for a theory of brain function is the fractured nature of our experimental knowledge about neuronal circuits. The zebrafish larva offers a unique opportunity to mitigate this barrier due to the ability to interrogate whole brain activity at single neuron resolution during ethologically relevant behaviors, the availability of exhaustive genetic tools and the ability to monitor the animal?s behavior over long times. To utilize these benefits the overall project will study a battery of sensorimotor functions in the fish larva, recording its behavioral responses, the brain structures involved, and the neuronal activity at single cell resolution. The primary goal of Project 3 is to integrate findings from the disparate experimental conditions into a coherent quantitative brain wide circuit model, guiding further validation, refinement and hypothesis testing experiments. We will establish a decade long experimental-theoretical-data-processing collaboration, yielding unprecedented advances in our understanding of the functioning of whole brains in animals with complex neuronal structure and function. We will adopt a multiscale approach, summarized as follows: ?Behavioral models - ?capable of an accurate probabilistic prediction of the animal?s actions given its environment and recent behavioral history. ?Conceptual circuit models ?- initial charts identifying the brain structures involved in a given sensorimotor task and their potential projections. ?Functional circuit models ?- systematic quantitative network models, whose functional units are local populations identified through dimensionality reduction of brain wide activity traces. Importantly, this brain wide model will continuously integrate additional structures and circuits as experiments on specific tasks progress. ?Neuronal circuit models ? data from perturbation and EM validation studies at the single neuron/synaptic level will be integrated into single neuron level models for specific local circuits. We will also incorporate data on action selection, multi-sensory integration, and decision making gathered in experiments of Aim 2 of the Overall Project. Model circuits will be integrated into the Multiscale Virtual Fish software platform to allow visualization and interrogation of experimental and modeling data in a common framework. Our multiscale approach will extend to the time domain. To model the brain state dependence of behavioral and neuronal functions (Overall Aim 3) we will build a hierarchical switchable model, with brain state slow dynamics at the top tier, which modulate the lower tier, ongoing fast behavioral and neuronal models (described above). We will seek to extract from our models of the fish brain and behavior general principles likely to generalize across species. This will be tested by using our modeling approach to related experiments in the rat and the fruit fly larva (Project 4), especially in the domain of brain state dynamics and the neuromodulatory control of behavior and sensorimotor processing."
"9370325","Abstract / Project Summary  Application of high-throughput gene expression technology to systemic sclerosis (SSc)  skin biopsies, isolated SSc cell lines and peripheral blood cell (PBC) samples has shown  that it will be an important tool for understanding the diversity in rheumatic diseases, as  well as changes to the underlying gene expression pathways. The Translational  Genomics and Data Integration (TGDI) core will use novel bioinformatic and genomic  methods that have been developed and already successfully implemented in the core  PI's laboratory to analyze SSc samples and healthy controls. High quality RNA will be  prepared and analyzed by RNA-sequencing using protocols established in the PIs  laboratory. All data are processed using standard and novel methods that use a  combination of algorithms that test for differential gene expression, enriched pathways  analysis and put the changes into the context of the all publicly available SSc high-  throughput data. The TGDI core provides network analyses using a Scleroderma  Specific Network (SSN) to analyze data from cells lines, mouse models, clinical trials,  and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), thus providing a measure of how well a therapy  eliminates the aberrant gene expression we observe in SSc. The goals of this core are  to 1) Provide high quality RNA-seq analyses for individual projects and process the  resulting data in a rigorously controlled analysis pipeline to provide differential gene  expression and patient subset assignments, 2) provide a systems biology and network  analysis of gene expression data in SSc using our novel SSN, and 3) perform meta-  analyses of SSc clinical trials using both existing data as well as new data generated as  part of the CORT research projects.  Relevance:  High-throughput gene expression analysis has allowed the definition of subsets of SSc  and identified deregulated pathways that can be targeted therapeutically. Recent  studies have shown that a patient's subset or activated pathways at baseline can be  predictive of clinical response.

"9562159","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota play an important role in the development of many diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Despite tremendous advances in characterizing microbial diversity within the gastrointestinal tract, very little is known about their function and role of even the most dominant bacterial species within the human host. It is becoming widely accepted that the metabolic products formed by gut bacteria directly impact on human health and disease, particularly regarding immune response and inflammation. In most cases, the products of metabolism are uncharacterized and their mechanism of action unknown. To advance this area of research, this information is vital. This proposal will establish the link between microbial diversity and metabolic functionality by 1) identifying the microbial metabolites and their in vivo concentrations, 2) establishing their mechanism of formation and 3) characterizing the bacterial species responsible. It will deliver these results through a series of acute human interventions with well characterized substrates (macro-, micro- and non-nutrients quantitatively determined) and both the microbial population and metabolites produced identified. The mechanism of transformation and the bacteria responsible will be determined by in vitro incubations, again with well characterized substrates, key metabolites and a unique and comprehensive collection of microbial isolates. Finally, the inflammatory activity of the quantitatively identified metabolites will be established ex vivo. This investigation will deliver several important outcomes including:  Identifying microbial metabolites which exhibit inflammatory activity at relevant in vivo concentrations. This will provide essential information (not currently available) informing wider studies looking at the action of microbial metabolites on particular receptors and biomarkers of health.  Determining the bacterial species responsible, elucidating their potential function in the gut.  Identification of keystone species with unique function will be a major focus and will allow us to identify extent of redundancy of certain species with regard to metabolite production. Established is the role of major macronutrients to drive microbial metabolism, both in the production of phytochemical metabolites and provision of carbohydrate/protein by-products. Only once the complex interplay between diet, the gut microbiota and human health is firmly established, will the role by which the gut microbiota contributes to maintenance of health or disease development be elucidated."
"9356795","Developmental Research Program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The purpose of the Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to fund promising projects by investigators whose current work may not focus exclusively on ovarian cancer, but who propose highly innovative translational studies of ovarian cancer that could become full SPORE projects or compete successfully for funding outside of the SPORE. The DRP provides a unique venue for making available significant financial support, and for demonstrating active institutional support, through a program that is rapidly responsive to new ideas or initiatives. Moreover, this program is rooted in a spirit of collaboration espoused by the SPORE investigators, who have an extensive track-record of bringing investigators from other disciplines into ovarian cancer research. The strength of the DRP rests in its ability to make available financial support needed to access all the critical expertise and resources within the entire SPORE. This will allow us to develop collaborative, multi-investigator, multi-institutional research projects with the support of innovative, investigator-initiated projects that have the potential to flourish into reliable and productive translational research projects that make a path from basic and/or population research projects into research focused on human clinical specimens/patient populations. Over the course of the previously-funded Ovarian SPORE grants since 2000, we have supported 48 DRPs. Overall, 14 former recipients of DRPs have received peer-reviewed funding in ovarian cancer as PI, Co- PI or Co-Investigator with eight as PIs (three DOD, two R01, one R21, one R03 and two CPRIT). Two recipients have been awarded OCRF funds (one Multi-Investigator Award and one Liz Tilberis Scholar). More recently, four recipients have been awarded six peer-reviewed ovarian cancer grants as PI (three R01, one R21, two CPRIT) and one Liz Tilberis Scholar award from the OCRF.

"9568135","Project Summary/Abstract  As the site of both negative selection of developing thymocytes and generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs),  the thymus plays a critical role in the multi-layered network of immune tolerance. The fate of a developing T  cell is dependent on the affinity of the interaction between the TCR and the peptide-MHC complex it  recognizes, with the highest affinity interactions resulting in deletion or Treg induction and lower affinity  interactions resulting in T cell survival and differentiation. The Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) is a major  transcriptional regulator of peripheral self-antigen expression within the thymus, and loss of Aire leads to  defects in negative selection due to reduced or absent thymic antigen expression in specialized medullary  thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). Several lines of evidence point to this process as playing an important role in  the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Here, we will use type 1 diabetes as a model disease system to further  unravel how insulin-specific T cells arise from the thymus that are both T effectors and T regulatory cells.  Our specific aims are:  AIM1: Define the role of Aire and thymic insulin expression on the thymic deletion of insB(9-23) specific T cells.  AIM2: Define the repertoire and specificity of thymic Foxp3+ T regulatory cells selected by Aire-expressing  cells.  These studies will be performed in close collaboration with PPG projects 2 (Bluestone) and 3 (Kappler) and  will help improve our understanding of how the T cell repertoire is shaped in the thymus in the setting of type 1  diabetes."

"9407074","Project Summary/Abstract Carcinoma of the pancreas, or pancreatic cancer (PC), is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, 55,300 new cases are expected in 2016. Despite advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate is less than 4%. Current treatments of PC include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy but they all only slightly prolong survival or relieve symptoms in patients with PC. Gemcitabine (GEM), first line therapy for advanced PC, is only modestly effective with a median survival of about 6 months in randomized clinical trials, The combination of GEM with different anticancer agents does not show significant survival advantage as compared with GEM alone. These limitations in efficacy of available treatments highlight the need for new treatments.  Pancreatic inflammation is known to increase the risk of PC. High macrophage infiltration into the tumor mass correlates with the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis development. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM-1), an inflammation amplifier, plays a role in PC progression. Expression of TREM-1 on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), is upregulated in patients with PC and correlates to disease severity. Recently, we demonstrated that a first-in-class TREM-1 inhibitory peptide GF9 in free form and bound to macrophage-targeted lipopeptide complexes that mimic human high density lipoproteins (GF9-HDL) inhibits tumor growth in animal models of PC. We also showed that blockade of TREM-1 inhibits release of cytokines and M-CSF in these animal models.  The main hypothesis of this project is that a combination therapy that includes TREM-1 inhibitors and anticancer agents and targets cancer-related inflammation and tumor cells directly can synergistically improve survival of PC patients. We also hypothesize that this effect will be especially pronounced in PC patients with high intratumoral macrophage infiltration. Our preliminary studies strongly support this hypothesis. The long-term objective of the proposed project is to develop a novel combinatorial approach to efficiently target PC. The major goal of the Phase I study is to demonstrate that specific inactivation of TREM-1 with first-in-class inhibitory peptides in combination with GEM or nanoparticle albumin (nab)- bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX), another promising agent that directly targets cancer cells and is widely approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (BC), synergistically suppresses PC tumor progression in animal model system and improves survival. Phase I specific aims are to: 1) evaluate effects and mechanisms of GF9-GEM and GF9-nab-PTX combinations in vitro, and 2) test GF9-GEM and GF9- nab-PTX combinations in two xenograft mouse models of PC. Non-toxic peptide GF9, which employs novel, ligand-independent mechanisms of TREM-1 inhibition, is anticipated to have less severe side effects. In order to increase peptide solubility, bioavailability and targeting to TAMs, we will utilize SignaBlok's proprietary HDL-based nanosystem for macrophage-targeted delivery of water insoluble and poorly water soluble drugs. We will use in vitro macrophage uptake assay to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of a putative receptor-mediated process of targeted delivery of GF9 to macrophages. We will optimize GF9 formulations based upon their stability, GF9 content, and macrophage uptake in vitro. We will use an in vitro cytotoxicity assay and immunoblot analysis to test proliferation of BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cells as well as expression of phospho-stathmin and alpha-tubulin in the presence of GEM, nab-PTX or their combinations with GF9 formulations. We will use BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 mouse xenograft models to test the ability of GF9- GEM and GF9-nab-PTX combinations to synergistically inhibit tumor progression and promote survival as compared with GF9, GEM, and nab-PTX alone. Free GF9 and GF9-HDL will be tested. Comprehensive histology and immunohistochemistry studies will be performed to analyze angiogenesis, intratumoral macrophage infiltration, and potential non-specific toxicity for organ/tissues.  It is anticipated that the proposed research will identify a novel anticancer combination approach that will set the stage for the development of new targeted combination therapies of PC, thereby leading to a higher survival rate of the patients. If successful, the Phase I will be followed in the Phase II by toxicology, absorption/ disposition/ metabolism/ excretion (ADME), pharmacology and chemistry/ manufacturing/ control (CMC) studies, filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and subsequent evaluation in humans. Final product will be the stable TREM-1- targeted lipopeptide formulation that can be used in combination therapies of PC patients to prolong their survival. Importantly, our recent data demonstrate that blockade of TREM-1 suppresses in vivo progression of not only PC but also non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thus, successful completion of Phase I will provide the proof of concept of the hypothesis that might be applicable to a variety of inflammation- associated tumors such as NSCLC, BC, colon cancer, and others."
"9469790","PROJECT SUMMARY: Children born prematurely are at elevated risk for psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, autism and anxiety. Indeed, the ?preterm behavioral phenotype? is comprised of inattention, anxiety and social- communication impairments. This constellation of comorbid disorders persists across the lifespan, accounting for long-term impairment and diminished quality of life among very preterm (VPT; born ?32 weeks gestation) children, a population at high risk for altered brain development. Yet, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the increased prevalence of these symptoms remain undetermined. Further, VPT children face high exposure rates to deleterious psychosocial risk factors which have similarly been linked to adverse psychiatric outcomes and changes in brain development. We posit that decreased connectivity and the resulting diminished developmental trajectories within and across key functional networks (e.g., default mode, frontoparietal control and cingulo-opercular networks) and related white matter tracts (e.g., cingulum, corpus callosum and uncinate) underlie comorbid preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms that persist or worsen at age 9-10. This process begins during infancy and extends to middle childhood, with psychosocial risk playing an important modifying role. Advances in MRI methodology now enable characterization of structural and functional brain networks with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we couple these highly innovative, state-of-the-art MRI techniques with detailed psychiatric assessments to study our unique, sociodemographically-diverse longitudinal cohort of VPT and term-born children (N=302) with high rates of psychosocial adversity now reaching age 9-10. The cohort has been followed since birth, including prospective collection of high-quality neonatal functional and structural connectivity MRI data and longitudinal assessments of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms and psychosocial and familial factors at ages 2 and 5, with >80% cohort retention to date at both assessment waves. Continued evaluation of this enriched cohort provides an opportunity to determine: 1) trajectories of preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms to define early indicators of later impairment enabling targeted interventions, 2) relationships between neonatal and age 9-10 functional and structural connectivity and these deficits, and 3) the modifying role of psychosocial adversity. Application of cutting-edge MRI acquisition and analysis methods, including machine learning approaches, enables unprecedented characterization of the effects of VPT birth on connectivity in the developing brain. We will extend these methods to delineate relationships between imaging measures and preterm behavioral phenotype symptoms, improving understanding of modifiable effects of early life exposures and psychosocial risk on psychiatric outcomes. These data are critical for developing individual- level neuroimaging, behavioral and psychosocial presymptomatic predictive models for adverse mental health outcomes, measures necessary to inform and evaluate treatments applicable during sensitive developmental periods which mitigate risks of psychopathology associated with prematurity and psychosocial adversity."

"9454752","Project Summary  The molecular mechanisms controlling stem cell self-renewal, competition and differentiation hold great potential for advances in treating cancer, and in regenerative medicine and in stem cell-based therapies. Stem cells reside in specialized, quiescent microenvironments called niches that secrete short-range signals promoting the maintenance of resident stem cells. Much is known about what regulates the autonomous behaviors within each stem cell type. However, much less is known about the competitive behaviors of between stem cells. The Drosophila testis is one of the best characterized paradigms for investigating stem cell behavior. In this tissue, a single quiescent niche supports two stem cell populations: germline stem cells (GSCs), which give rise to sperm, and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs), which produce cyst cells. Prior work has shown that GSCs compete with each other for limited space at the niche, but little is known about molecular mechanisms controlling this cooperativity. This proposal reveals the first mutation that endows a male GSC with the ability to out-compete its wild-type neighbors and colonize the testis stem cell niche. The preliminary data in this application show that a competitive GSC and its descendants in the Drosophila testis disadvantage their wild-type neighbors by altering the niche milieu. Additionally, the competitive GSCs remain immune to these alterations by upregulating adhesion factors. Sophisticated genetic techniques in Drosophila will be used to achieve the aims in this proposal. Aim 1 is focused on the transcriptional regulation of extracellular matrix factors in competitive GSCs. Aim 2 will test the model that competitive GSCs have increased adhesion, thus allowing them to remain in the niche while their wild-type neighbors differentiate. We envision this work will impact human reproductive biology and regenerative medicine."
"9406615","PROJECT SUMMARY This application from the Chicagoland Metropolitan Asthma Consortium (CMAC) is in response to the RFA entitled ?Clinical Centers for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network?. The Chicago metropolitan area has almost 10 million inhabitants who are racially and eth- nically diverse. The City of Chicago, which represents about one-third of this population, has an asthma preva- lence rates in both children and adults exceeding 10% and has one of the highest asthma mortality rates in the United States. Severe and/or exacerbation prone (S/EP) asthma affects over 10% of asthmatic patients and accounts for both substantial morbidity and a majority of asthma-related costs. While substantial progress has been made in helping patients control asthma symptoms, how to use current therapies to target specific phe- notypes precisely and prevent disease progression, and when and how to change these therapies in the event of failure, remain unclear. The CMAC includes academic medical center partners: Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, Lurie Children's Hospital, Rush University, and John H. Stroger Hospital, and an expan- sive network of Community Partners. The CMAC is uniquely qualified to participate in the PrecISE Network and contribute to the development and successful completion of the network clinical trials and proof of con- cept/mechanistic studies. Our key personnel have extensive experience in asthma clinical and translational research, including studies exploring its pathophysiology, pathogenesis (genetic and environmental factors), epidemiology and treatment; leadership roles in key research support and CTSA programs at their respective institutions; successful collaborations together and with multiple institutions and networks on asthma research programs; access to a large, diverse asthma population; and documented, successful ability to enroll patients in NIH, foundation and industry sponsored asthma research studies and clinical trials. We propose a model intervention sequential, adaptive clinical trial protocol with three targeted, precise interventions that will be guided by repeated assessment of biomarkers to inform both the initial therapy choice and subsequent inter- ventions. Further, our proposal utilizes the latest adaptive clinical trial design, careful longitudinal follow-up, and will use the responses of early-recruited patients to guide targeted therapy in subsequently-enrolled sub- jects. Our targeted interventions include three different anti-cytokine and prostaglandin therapies directed to Th2-high patients, and three different therapies directed to Th2-low, obese and lean patients. Participation by the CMAC will strengthen the PrecISE Network so that it will achieve its goal to complete successfully early- phase clinical trials to test targeted interventions in patients with S/EP asthma, generate new knowledge re- garding asthma phenotypes, predictive biomarkers and therapeutic responsiveness, and positively inform clini- cal practice in the treatment of patients with severe asthma."
"9396905","PROJECT SUMMARY Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a virus that has infected and led to the deaths of millions of people since its emergence several decades ago. While modern anti-retroviral treatments (ART) have made the infection manageable for patients, negative side effects, the risk of drug resistance, and the aggregate cost due to life-long usage inspire the need for new, effective treatment strategies. One viable strategy is to disrupt the intrinsically efficient replication cycle of HIV-1. A fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate replication would advance this mission by revealing novel targets and new approaches for ARTs. This proposal focuses on the late stages of HIV-1 replication, which encompasses the assembly of a viral RNA dimer and other constituents, budding of the packaged components (i.e., immature virion), and activation of the virion through maturation. The group specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein is the main structural constituent, which appears to contribute important functionality during this process. For example, Gag self-assemble into an incomplete, asymmetric, and contiguous hexameric lattice; this immature lattice is found along the inner surface of the released immature virion. Proteolytic cleavage of Gag then triggers a morphological change in which the capsid protein and RNA are condensed into a fullerene core (i.e., mature lattice). Most recently, conformational changes throughout Gag have been hypothesized to act as molecular switches that act as regulatory signals. However, specific details have been difficult to experimentally characterize owing to the pleomorphic nature of virions and their associated transition states. I propose to study the molecular structure-function relationships that regulate HIV-1 assembly, budding, and maturation using a systematic, multiscale computer simulation framework. The goals of this project are to (1) predict the structure of native-like immature lattices with molecular resolution, (2) uncover molecular switches throughout Gag that regulate immature lattice assembly, and (3) determine the dynamic morphological changes during viral maturation. I will first develop a coarse-grained model of Gag to study the structure and assembly mechanisms of the immature lattice at the membrane interface in the presence of RNA. Subsequently, these coarse-grained simulations will systematically guide atomistic simulations of key protein interfaces to identify the triggering mechanisms and importance of potential molecular switches, including a noted transition of the spacer peptide 1 (SP1) domain from random coil to alpha helix for Gag oligomerization. Finally, a novel reactive coarse-grained model will be developed to identify disassembly pathways during maturation. During all phases of this project, experimentally tractable predictions will be made and tested through my collaboration with two leading experimentalists, which will enable iterative refinements to the developed models. The insights from this study will have a broad impact on virology, macromolecular assembly, and molecular biophysics."
"9539385","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     As the second leading cause of death and disability, ischemic stroke kills and disables millions of people each year. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), the only approved treatment, dissolves the culprit fibrin thrombus to restore blood flow and relieve the brain from ischemia. Unfortunately, after prolonged ischemia, TPA may cause serious or fatal complications; this restricts TPA use to a minority of stroke patients.  Although TPA has provided a model for therapeutic fibrinolysis, recent data suggest a new paradigm that assigns a central role to regulatory molecules such as alpha-2-antiplasmin (a2AP) in determining outcomes after ischemic stroke. Clinical observations suggest that high a2AP levels may increase the risk of ischemic stroke and of TPA failure. In experiments that challenge the current therapeutic paradigm for fibrinolytic treatment of stroke, we have shown that a2AP markedly increases brain injury, in a dose-dependent fashion. Conversely, a2AP deficiency or monoclonal antibody inactivation of a2AP, profoundly reduces brain injury, apoptosis, hemorrhage, and swelling. Even after prolonged brain ischemia, a2AP inactivation reduces microvascular thrombosis and MMP-9 expression (a marker of acute inflammation). As a result, a2AP inactivation prevents death and disability after ischemic stroke. Thus, when compared to TPA, a2AP-inactivation appears to provide a safe and effective approach for improving stroke treatment and, through a NINDS collaboration, we are pursuing the development of a2AP inactivation therapy. This proposal seeks to determine the pathophysiologic mechanisms through which a2AP enhances ischemic brain injury after thromboembolic stroke. The organizing hypothesis is that a2AP acts through plasminogen-dependent mechanisms to enhance the development of microvascular thrombosis and impair downstream, microvascular perfusion. Through these mechanisms, a2AP promotes the development of inflammatory responses such as MMP-9 expression and neutrophil recruitment, which have acute deleterious effects. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a2AP's deleterious effects in ischemic stroke are due to diminished plasmin(ogen)-dependent, endogenous fibrinolysis that impairs microvascular blood flow through its effect on the culprit thrombus and the development of downstream, thrombin-dependent, microvascular thrombosis. We also propose to examine the hypothesis (Aim 2) that a2AP regulates the endogenous fibrinolytic system to affect the development of ischemic injury, hemorrhage, swelling and survival in thromboembolic stroke through inflammation-linked pathways that require MMP-9 activity and neutrophil deposition. Finally, we will use molecular complementation with specific a2AP mutants to examine the hypothesis that specific structural elements in the a2AP molecule selectively enhance adverse outcomes (such as neuronal injury, hemorrhage, etc.) in ischemic stroke."
"9458032","Project Summary  Liver fibrosis is the consequence of chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B and C infection, and alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently there is no effective anti-fibrotic agent for liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the unmet medical needs for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis are significant.  Liver inflammation is a crucial mechanism for activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) and liver fibrosis. Activated HSCs produce extracellular matrix (ECM) including collagen, fibronectin, and hyaluronic acids (HA). Endogenous HA have been implicated in the disease progression of lungs, kidneys, joints, heart, and brain. In the liver, patients with liver cirrhosis show elevated HA levels in the blood. However, the biological functions of endogenous HA produced in liver fibrosis have not been determined. HA are produced in high molecular weight forms (HMW; MW>1000kDa) by hyaluronan synthase (HAS) 1-3. In the setting of inflammation, HA are degraded into low molecular weight (LMW) forms (MW~100-300kDa). LMW-HA exacerbates tissue injury and inflammation through binding to its receptors, CD44 and TLR4.  The objective of this study is to determine the biological functions of endogenous HA and its downstream effector pathway in HSC activation and in liver fibrosis. Based on previous publications and our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that HAS2-mediated HSC-derived HA and HA's downstream effector pathways promote HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Moreover, we further hypothesize that by targeting HA a new interventional strategy for treating liver fibrosis can be developed.  To test our hypotheses, we will investigate if HAS2-mediated HA production in HSCs promotes liver fibrosis through loss- and gain-of-function approaches using HSC-specific Has2 knockout (Has2?HSC) mice and HAS2 transgenic (ASMA-HAS2 Tg) mice. We will also use human tissue samples to examine HSCs as the source of HAS2 and HA in human cirrhotic livers (Aim 1). We will investigate the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of HAS2 expression in HSCs as the molecular mechanisms of dysregulated HAS2 expression in liver fibrosis (Aim 2). We will then investigate the role of Notch1 signaling as the HA's downstream effector pathway for HSC activation and liver fibrosis (Aim 3). Finally, we will examine interventional potential of blocking HA synthesis for treating liver fibrosis (Aim 4)."
"9484560","PROJECT SUMMARY  African American women suffer higher rates of hypertension, stroke, type II diabetes, stress, and depressive symptoms than do non-Hispanic white women. Prime Time Sister Circles (PTSC) empowers women to proactively manage their health by promoting the effective use of preventive health care; providing screening and monitoring of blood pressure and weight, and teaching strategies for managing stress, increasing physical activity, and improving nutrition. The 12-week community-based, holistic lifestyle intervention aims to improve care, reduce morbidity and mortality, and reduce health care costs through prevention, earlier detection, and improved management of chronic disease through a culturally tailored program addressing specific barriers experienced by midlife African American women. Improving the health habits and health knowledge of midlife African American women play a critical role in their own health and also impact the lives of their partners, children, grandchildren, and communities. Women in this age group are considered role models and influence the health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of their families and communities.  The proposed 5-year mixed methods study is a collaboration between The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions (HCHDS), Gaston and Porter Health Improvement Center and the American Institutes for Research (AIR). We propose to survey African American women 40 to 75 years of age who participated in the PTSC between 2008 and 2014. We will collect data on blood pressure, health status, health behaviors, social support, social networks, and health care utilization through participant in-person surveys. We will compare African American women who participated in the PTSC (i.e., PTSC alumnae) to matched samples of African American women drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS. Further, we will conduct focus groups and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with participants to explore their experience in PTSC, examine how perceptions of increased social support, and social networks created through participation in PTSC, influenced adherence to antihypertensive therapies and behaviors. We will use these data to address the following four specific aims: ? To determine if social support and social connectedness through PTSC sustained adherence to  antihypertensive regimens among women who participated in PTSC. ? To determine if PTSC alumnae maintained improvements in their blood pressure and healthy behaviors  (i.e, nutrition, physical activity, stress management, and the use of preventive healthcare services). ? To determine if PTSC alumnae have better blood pressure, BMI, and waist circumference and health  behaviors compared to similar women who participated in the NHANES. ? To determine if PTSC alumnae have better health behaviors and health care utilization compared to  similar women who participated in the NHIS and MEPS."

"9426211","PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the impact of alcohol consumption on bone health is important because alcohol influences bone metabolism and over half of the adult population in the United States drinks alcoholic beverages. Low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption are generally associated with beneficial skeletal effects while chronic alcohol abuse predisposes individuals to bone fractures. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate the primary mechanisms mediating the divergent skeletal effects of low/moderate and heavy alcohol consumption. An appreciation of the precise effects and mechanisms of action of alcohol on bone metabolism is important because of the enormous economic, social and personal burden associated with poor bone health. Progress in understanding the actions of alcohol on bone metabolism are hampered by (1) the extreme difficulty in performing intervention studies in humans, (2) limitations of commonly used animal models, (3) failure to adequately consider alcohol?s effects on tissue and organ systems that impact bone, and (4) difficulty in accurately replicating human drinking behavior in animals. The studies proposed in this R01 application will overcome limitations of human and prior animal studies by using a non-human primate (monkey) model for voluntary alcohol consumption that mimics the full range of human drinking behavior. We will use linear regression models, multivariate linear regression models, machine learning, and systems analysis to establish the impact of pattern of alcohol consumption (none, light/moderate, binge, heavy and very heavy) on bone metabolism in rhesus (Macaca mulatta; n=105) and cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis; n=86) macaques in the context of sex, age and alcohol-induced perturbations in tissue and organ systems that can influence bone. We will identify the latter perturbations by determining the effect of alcohol on specific protein (e.g., peptide hormones and cytokines) and small molecule (e.g., steroid hormones) effectors in blood. Our central hypothesis, based in part on our preliminary data in rats, macaques and humans, is that changes in the blood levels of bone-active hormones and cytokines, derived from several tissues/organs, in response to alcohol intake act in concert to modulate bone cell number and activity. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Define the correlative relationships between the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption and bone in male and female macaques. Specific Aim 2: Define the correlative relationships among blood ethanol levels, key bone active hormones and cytokines, and biochemical markers of bone turnover in male and female macaques. At the completion of this project, we expect to have established that the magnitude of skeletal response to alcohol will correlate with changes in serum biochemical markers of bone turnover which, in turn, will correlate with changes in circulating levels of specific hormones and cytokines. The primary positive impact of our anticipated findings is identification of key underlying factors responsible for the complex, context-dependent actions of alcohol on bone metabolism."

"9448643","! PROJECT SUMMARY: This application's broad, long-term objective is to improve the health of millions of Americans with or at risk for obesity- associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease in the United States. After successfully validating MR imaging biomarkers for hepatic steatosis, the earliest histologic feature of NAFLD, in the first cycle of this grant, this competitive renewal focuses on hepatic fibrosis and inflammation, features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive subtype of NAFLD that can progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver-related death. MR elastography (MRE), a noninvasive method to quantify tissue stiffness, is the leading imaging-based technique for assessing liver fibrosis in NAFLD, but the true diagnostic performance of MRE for detecting fibrosis and NASH cross-sectionally, and for monitoring their change longitudinally, is incompletely understood. By optimizing and rigorously evaluating MRE for these purposes, we will address major knowledge and technical gaps that have obscured the appropriate utilization of this technology in clinical care and research. Aim 1: Optimize MRE wavefield generation in severe obesity, applicable to both conventional 2D- and advanced 3D-MRE. Aim 2: Characterize the precision profile of conventional 2D- and advanced 3D-MRE in severe obesity (same-day repeatability, field-strength reproducibility, reader reproducibility, between-day reproducibility). Aim 3: Determine the accuracy of conventional 2D- and advanced 3D-MRE in severe obesity to a) diagnose fibrosis and NASH cross-sectionally and b) monitor change in fibrosis and resolution of NASH longitudinally. Significance: By determining the true diagnostic performance of conventional 2D- and advanced 3D-MRE for detecting and monitoring fibrosis and NASH in bariatric patients, the proposed research will inform the appropriate utilization of MRE for clinical care, clinical trials, and other research in obesity-associated NAFLD. Additionally, if the research confirms the promise of advanced 3D-MRE to detect early-stage NASH, this will represent a game-changing new technical capability. Innovation: This application brings innovation in three thematic areas: (1) Study design: prospective cross-sectional and longitudinal study in bariatric patients, a technically challenging population with balanced disease severity distribution ideal for addressing the scientific aims. (2) Wavefield generation: testing of new flexible drivers designed to generate high-quality wavefields. (3) MRE analysis: rigorous testing of advanced 3D-MRE reconstruction and analysis methods that in preliminary animal and human studies show promise for diagnosing early-stage NASH. Research design & methods: Phase 1 of this 2-site study will optimize MRE wavefield generation in severe obesity by identifying the driver type and position that maximize MRE precision. Using that optimal driver type/position, Phase 2 will enroll 100 severely obese adults (50/site) undergoing weight-loss surgery in a prospective longitudinal study with 2D- and 3D-MRE at multiple time points. Reference standards for the presence of fibrosis and NASH, and their change, will include expert consensus scoring and quantitative image analysis of paired contemporaneous biopsies obtained at surgery and at 6 months. Complementary anthropometric, laboratory, and MRI measures will be acquired to identify factors that affect MRE performance and develop hypotheses for future studies. !"
"9479597","Genetic approaches have been successful in identifying causal genetic factors, both common and rare, that contribute to risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), providing a crucial starting point for mechanistic neurobiological investigations. However, moving towards an integrated mechanistic understanding of ASD at a molecular, cellular, and circuit level faces substantial challenges, such as extreme genetic heterogeneity and the lack of causal frameworks with which to connect different levels of analysis of nervous system function in model systems or patients. Nearly a decade ago, we reasoned that gene and protein networks would provide an organizing framework for understanding heterogeneous psychiatric disease genetic risk in a unified context and inform disease modeling; indeed there is now substantial evidence supporting convergence of major effect risk genes during mid-fetal cortical development. Furthermore, related functional genomic studies, including in those with a major gene form of ASD (dup)15q11-13, show shared patterns of transcriptional and chromatin dysregulation in post-mortem ASD brain, further supporting biological convergence. Where and how this occurs, and what biological mechanism(s) it reflects is not known. To address this, we propose an ambitious project that addresses several major challenges in establishing causal linkages between genetic risk and CNS structure and function in ASD. The work proposed in this multi-PI U01 involves a team of four principal investigators and co-investigators from UCLA and Stanford with the expertise necessary to perform this work using state of the art methodologies, ranging from developing and characterizing in vitro models of human brain development, stem cells, physiology, genomics, physics, and behavior. Through close collaboration, we will develop and analyze in vitro human stem cell based models that are differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells and assembled into organized 3D brain cultures called human forebrain spheroids (hFS). These hFS contain the major cell classes of the developing forebrain, including progenitors, radial glia, cortical interneurons, glutamatergic neurons, and non-reactive astrocytes, and form functional synapses. We will model the effects of six major effect ASD risk loci in hFS with molecular, genomic, and physiological analyses to assess convergence at each level of analysis. We will also conduct comparisons of physiology using three rodent models based on the same genes modeled in vitro with the aim of integrating phenotypes to develop predictive models and compare with in vivo rodent models. We will analyze the relationship of molecular alterations and basic cellular and synaptic features with potential emergent or dynamic network features in control-derived hFS and compare these features with hFS harboring ASD risk mutations and test a subset of causal relationships based on network model predictions. Completion of these aims will lead to a more clear understanding of the power and limitations of model systems and computational models, while uncovering potential areas of convergence in different genetic forms of ASD."
"9553008","PROJECT SUMMARY:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small, partially double-stranded DNA virus that causes acute and chronic hepatitis. An estimated 400 million people are chronically infected worldwide, many suffering early death due to liver failure and primary liver cancer (HCC). The chance of resolving HBV infection is age dependent: approximately 90% of neonatal infections become chronic, whereas at least 90% of adult infections are cleared spontaneously. It is generally accepted that a broad and diverse adaptive immune response is important in clearing acute HBV infection. However, why an individual generates, or fails to generate, a favorable response, and why this capability varies with age, is just beginning to be understood.  The study of HBV immunopathogenesis has been limited because HBV only infects outbred species whose immune systems are difficult to examine and it does not infect mice, the species in which most of the tools to study immune mechanisms have been developed. My laboratory has developed transgenic mouse models of primary HBV infection that mimic key differences in HBV clearance and persistence in humans, including the age-related dichotomy in human HBV infection outcome. This model has allowed us to address fundamental questions in HBV biology: 1. Why is the immune response and disease outcome different depending on the age of the individual at the time of infection? 2. What are the immune mechanisms that facilitate viral control, and how do these differ from the immune mechanisms that lead to chronic viral infection? 3. Can immune modulation of pathways identified to be important in effective HBV immunity tilt ineffective immune responses toward viral control?  Our collective data using this model and our correlative studies in humans, demonstrate that immune priming to HBV occurs in the liver, and that effective immune priming requires orchestrated formation of leukocyte clusters that are anchored by macrophages and monocytes. Effective HBV immunity requires hepatic TFH cell priming and IL-21 production in the liver, where it is essential for optimal generation of specific CD8+ T and B cell responses that are crucial for viral clearance. Furthermore, maturation of liver APCs and their age-dependent expression of the chemokine CXCL13 is crucial for B cell differentiation and class-switching, while age-dependent expression of the co-stimulatory ligand OX40L explains differences in TFH priming and IL-21 production in the liver.  While these new data begin to help us formulate a new paradigm to explain age-dependent HBV persistence and to identify therapeutic targets, there are many unanswered questions related to the cells and pathways involved in the formation of hepatic leukocyte structures and the priming of effective immunity. Our proposal explores the hypothesis that a resident hepatic population of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) is important for the development of lymphoid organization and/or the priming of effective HBV immunity. In addition, we aim to target the development of hepatic ILC3s, and the expression of CXCL13 and OX40L, to tilt the immune response in young and ?chronic HBV mice? toward viral control and HBsAb seroconversion."
"9392487","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects more than 1.7 million each year, with most cases being mild (mTBI) including more than 300,000 service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Moreover, 15-30% of mTBI subjects have symptoms that do not resolve 3 months post-injury and which can lead to permanent disability. In view of these facts, early detection of brain injury is critical to identifying those who are most at risk for poor outcome. Unfortunately mTBI is difficult to diagnose because conventional CT/MRI is not sensitive and clinical diagnosis is non-specific. Recent technical developments, however, have enabled measurements such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We have advanced these methods further with patient specific profiles, free-water correction, and spectral edited MRS. Combining these novel tools will make possible a virtual biopsy of mTBI to characterize, indirectly, different tissue components (i.e., neurons, axons, neurotransmitters, glial cells, myelin), as well as different aspects of TBI pathology (acute micro-hemorrhage, edema, inflammation, gliosis, and degeneration). This multi-modal approach will enable the development of biomarkers of injury, and with a longitudinal design, to chart brain changes following injury, including the evolution of neurocognitive recovery and persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS). In this proposal, 48 acute mTBI patients and 30 matched orthopedic controls will be recruited and will undergo imaging and clinical/cognitive evaluation at 1 week, 3 and 6 months post-injury at the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS), VA Boston Healthcare System. In addition, 96 mTBI Veterans (1/2 blast/1/2 no blast, with/without PPCS), and 48 Veteran controls will be selected from previously acquired data using an identical imaging protocol on the same hardware and matched to the acute sample on age, gender, and socio-economic status. Our strategy is to combine multi-modal imaging to provide prognosis of mTBI outcome, based on neuroimaging markers at the acute stage. Our aims are: 1) to detect brain abnormalities associated with PPCS using advanced patient-specific multimodal imaging profiles of injury; 2) to chart the longitudinal course of mTBI from injury to recovery or PPCS; and 3) to identify multimodal imaging predictors of recovery versus PPCS. Using longitudinal data, we will make predictions about recovery versus PPCS based on a priori hypotheses and an empirically derived algorithm. These predictors will be generalized to the VA population, where common and unique patterns of injury will be identified, making imaging predictors a valuable tool in theater, and a first ste in determining treatment interventions. Based on preliminary results and prior studies, we that expect PPCS in VA and acute mTBI will show altered imaging markers associated with gliosis, and with axonal degeneration and chronic neuroinflammation, although the location and severity of abnormalities will be different. We also expect acute mTBI patients will differ from controls, early in the course of injury, and as a group will evince axonal injury, small vasculature hemorrhage, increased myelin injury, vasogenic edema, and increased inflammation, assessed using diffusion indices, and decreased N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; MRS neuronal marker), and increased glutamate (Glu; MRS marker of excitotoxicity). We predict that brain injury will begin to normalize in subjects who recover, suggesting a staging of brain recovery. For those who do not recover at 6 months, we expect to see greater evidence of gliosis, axonal degeneration and inflammation, on diffusion indices, also reflected in choline, Glu, and glutathione changes on MRS indices. A combination of inflammatory processes, extensive axonal damage and gliosis multimodal imaging markers at 1 week, will predict poor recovery and clinical PPCS at 6 months, while evidence of white matter regeneration at early stages will be among the strongest predictors of good recovery."
"9351523","This Program Project on Structure-Based Antagonism of HlV-1 Envelope Function in Cell Entry will lead to a new understanding of the HlV-1 envelope (Env) structure and structural transitions that accompany cell entry, that in turn will permit the development of potent, selective antagonists of HIV-1 entry for both intervention and prevention of the AIDS pandemic.  The major focus of the Synthetic Thrust (Project 3) within this Program Project will be the development of new small molecule antagonists of the CD4-gp120 protein-protein interaction that mediate viral entry into target host cells. The CD4 binding site of gp120 has great promise as a major therapeutic target site on the Env protein for inhibitor design, given the well-defined binding surface that is highly conserved in diverse virus sub-types.  Ligand binding at this site, however, has also evolved to trigger the allosteric activation process that the virus employs to mediate fusion. As we proceed forward, we will build upon our recent discovery of DMJ-ll-121, a small molecule that targets two highly conserved sites of gp120 and in turn neutralizes HlV-1 without triggering the allosteric response in gp120. The guidelines developed during the design of DMJ-ll-121 provide a roadmap for the discovery of new small molecule inhibitors of the dynamic protein-protein interactions. This roadmap will also be employed to optimize new leads identified by the screening programs within the Program Project.  The Synthetic Thrust, in conjunction with the other Projects will also prepare conjugates of the antagonists with molecular probes to study structurally the biochemical mechanisms associated with HlV-1 neutralization. Photoaffinity labels will be attached covalently to highly active antagonists to elucidate the binding sites of inhibitors that entrap the Env in an inactive conformation. The dynamic processes associated with small molecule binding to the HIV-1 Env trimer will also be interrogated with recently developed single molecule FRET probes. Finally, innovative covalent labeling strategies to append a tetrairidium cluster to validated antagonists will facilitate binding site analysis within solubilized Env trimers by SP-cryoEM."
"9386899","Research Project 3: The impact of inhaled environmental exposures on the microbiota of the upper  airways of African children: Abstract Inhaled exposures, such as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), volatile compounds, particulate matter and microbial components modify the risk of developing respiratory tract illness in children, including asthma and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Exposure to high levels of inhaled pollutants is common in our cohort of South African children. These inhaled exposures may also affect the microbial composition of the airways, which may, in part, mediate the effect on respiratory illness. In the sub-Sahelian region of Africa, during the dry season, there are outbreaks of meningococcal disease, which are preceded by oropharyngeal colonization with Neisseria meningitidis. We therefore propose to study (1) the association between indoor air pollutants and the upper airway microbiota, including NP carriage of S. pneumoniae and oropharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis; (2) the association between the household dust microbiota and the NP and OP microbiota; and (3) seasonal variation in inhaled exposures and the relationship with the NP and OP microbiota. We will utilize existing NP and household dust specimens, and detailed data on inhaled pollutants and ETS exposure from our cohort in South Africa. We will also prospectively collect NP and OP samples from children within households in The Gambia, and measure particulate matter and ETS exposure. We will use amplicon sequencing to define the bacterial and fungal components of the NP, OP and household dust microbiota. We will do selective culture to identify NP colonization with S. pneumoniae and OP colonization with N. meningitidis. We will determine the association between exposure to inhaled pollutants and the NP/OP microbiota and between the household dust microbiota and the NP/OP microbiota. Description of the influence of inhaled environmental exposures on the NP and OP microbiota will contribute towards an improved understanding of risk factors that influence the upper airway microbiota. Together with work done on projects 1 and 2 this project will identify potentially modifiable exposures that contribute, through their effect on the NP or OP microbiota, to carriage of N. meningitidis or S. pneumoniae and to respiratory illness in children.

"9437928","Project Summary/Abstract: Mono-methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) is a chromatin mark closely associated with transcriptional enhancers and other intergenic regulatory elements; however, the functional significance of this histone modification has yet to be demonstrated. Our lab has previously identified Trr and MLL3/4 as the major H3K4- monomethylases in Drosophila and mammals, respectively. Recent genome-wide association studies identified the trr human orthologues, MLL3 and MLL4, as genes frequently mutated in a wide variety of human cancers, along with other COMPASS subunits. Previous work has established that Trr protein is necessary for regulating enhancer function; however, the role of Trr-dependent H3K4me1 at enhancers has not been tested directly. To address this, we have taken advantage of an embryonic recessive lethal Trr-NULL allele, trr[1], to test the necessity of Trr-dependent methylase activity. We have found the trr[1] lethality can be rescued by expressing a Trr transgene whose SET domain contains either a catalytic-inactive (C2398A) or a catalytic- hyperactive (Y2383F) point mutation. As expected, western blots confirm substantial reductions of H3K4me1 in the catalytic-dead mutant, while the catalytic-hyperactive mutation shows significant increases in H3K4me2/3. Our ChIP-seq studies verify these changes are occurring specifically at enhancer elements. Aside from these molecular phenotypes, the two mutant fly lines show no obvious developmental, reproductive, or behavioral differences in comparison with a control trr-WT rescue line. These observations raise three important questions: 1) what is the function of Trr-dependent H3K4-methylation in Drosophila development, 2) what are the non-enzymatic functions of Trr in regulating enhancer-mediated processes, and 3) how do non- catalytic mutations found in MLL3/4 disrupt enhancer function and lead to human cancer pathogenesis? By exploiting Drosophila melanogaster, in which MLL3/4 are represented by just one enzyme, trr, I will uncover fundamental details regarding how these proteins function to regulate enhancer activity, and how deleterious mutations to MLL3/4 result in cancer formation."
"9363756","Project Summary Insulin signaling is critical for multiple facets of animal physiology. Its dysregulation causes insulin resistance syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes. The spindle checkpoint ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation and guards against aneuploidy. The key spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1 can simultaneously bind to Cdc20, converting it from an anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activator to a subunit of an APC/C-inhibitory complex called the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). During checkpoint inactivation, a critical inhibitor of Mad2, p31comet promotes checkpoint inactivation and timely chromosome segregation. Recently, combining approaches in mouse genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and single-cell genomics, we have discovered a critical role of the p31comet?Mad2?BubR1 module of mitotic regulators in insulin signaling through regulating insulin receptor (IR) endocytosis. In the mouse, p31comet ablation diminishes IR at the plasma membrane prior to insulin binding and causes defective insulin signaling in multiple tissues and metabolic syndrome. Mechanistically, Mad2 directly binds to IR through a canonical Mad2-interacting motif (MIM). IR-bound Mad2 facilitates BubR1-dependent recruitment of the clathrin adaptor AP2 to IR. p31comet blocks Mad2-BubR1 association and prevents spontaneous IR endocytosis. Mad2 and BubR1 are also required for insulin-stimulated IR endocytosis. This unexpected link between mitotic regulators and insulin signaling raises several outstanding questions that we wish to address in this proposal. In Aim 1, we will further elucidate the mechanism and regulation of insulin-stimulated IR endocytosis. In particular, we will determine how the newly discovered Mad2?BubR1 mechanism cooperates with previously described mechanisms to mediate proper IR endocytosis. We will establish how these mechanisms are regulated by insulin signaling. In Aim 2, we will test the intriguing hypothesis that insulin signaling reciprocally regulates the spindle checkpoint. In preliminary results, we have created a knock-in mouse (Insr4A/4A) with mutated IR alleles (4A) deficient for Mad2 binding. IR 4A cells have a weakened spindle checkpoint. We will determine the mechanisms by which IR promotes spindle checkpoint signaling through cellular and in vitro reconstitution experiments. In Aim 3, we will define the physiological functions of the mutual regulation between IR and mitotic regulators by examining the phenotypes of the Insr4A/4A mouse. We will test whether defective IR plasma membrane localization contributes to type 2 diabetes by comparing IR localization in liver biopsies from non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Collectively, the proposed research will further clarify the mechanism and function of the unexpected link between mitotic regulators and insulin signaling, and may establish the Mad2? BubR1?AP2 module as a novel therapeutic target for treating diabetes."
"9235063","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Drosophila midgut provides a useful model for understanding the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Great progress has been made in associating specific configurations of our gut microbial communities with distinct physiological states. Yet, precisely how enteroendocrine cells embedded in the gut epithelium sense and signal these dynamically changing microbial cues is less well understood. Our preliminary studies have laid the foundation for a powerful new Drosophila model of the enteroendocrine system. These observations raise the central hypothesis that endocrine cells signal over a long-range to control homeostasis of distant tissues. In Aim 1 we propose to characterize the mechanism(s) by which enteroendocrine cells signal peripheral tissues. In Aim 2 we propose to define the factors influencing luminal sensing by enteroendocrine cells. These questions are currently difficult to address in mammals, as the tools for conditionally manipulating both endocrine cell subtypes and peripheral target tissues with single cell resolution have not yet been established. Thus, we propose to use Drosophila as a model to dissect mechanisms controlling the endocrine system."

This will be achieved by better understanding and addressing the social determinants of cancer risk factors through community-engaged educational and scientific practices that synergistically capitalize on the strengths and contributions of the constituent partners. Our educational, outreach, and research initiatives will focus on the reduction of cancer risk among blacks and Hispanics in two key Houston communities: the Third Ward (largely black) and the East End (largely Hispanic). The U-HAND will have three cores: Administrative, Pilot Research Program, and Cancer Research Education Program, which will achieve the following specific aims: 1) Develop a research and educational partnership between the University of Houston, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Houston community to stimulate collaborative cancer disparities research related to tobacco use, poor diet, and physical inactivity among blacks and Hispanics; 2) Support the development of Early Stage Investigators through a rigorous pilot research program; 3) Increase the number of underrepresented racial/ethnic minority students and faculty engaged in cancer disparities research by providing them with research training, mentorship and service learning experiences; and 4) Develop a robust community outreach program focused on engaging community members in cancer disparities education, research, and clinical trials. The U-HAND partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), External Advisory Board (EAB) and Community Advisory Board. The Administrative Core will serve as the strategic hub of the U-HAND partnership, connecting the two partnering institutions, as well as a network of community partners, to address complex social determinants that are the root of cancer disparities."

"9408825","With this Phase 2 submission, IsoPlexis proposes to deliver a single-cell proteomic solution for ultra-sensitive detection of unique correlative biomarkers in pre-clinical mouse models, in an automated system that can be used to accelerate the discovery of potential immune therapeutics. The recent revolution in new basic science discovery is failing to translate into improved patient treatment. The reduction of new drug and biologic applications submitted to the FDA every year is directly due to only 10% of promising preclinically approved treatments eventually advancing to market. As the pharmaceutical/biotech industry embarks on capitalizing on new immunotherapy discoveries, the complex human immune system presents challenges to the development of new treatments. While improved humanized mouse models (such as the Humanized Immune Systems, HIS) are a step forward, a need exists for an enabling biomedical technology to improve immune biomarker detection that de-risks therapy selection translating to success in human treatment. A platform which (1) measures secreted protein polyfunctionality in a single-cell platform for mice, and (2) gathers this data from limited mouse samples is necessary. (3) The technology should be able to measure multiplexed, emerging, protein biomarkers that have proven critical to such immune therapies in humans, drastically improving clinical success. With the successes from the Phase I part of the project, IsoPlexis has developed such a high-resolution immune response biomarker detection system (SCBC), delivering a comprehensive evaluation of the full polyfunctional protein secretion response of each immune cell to treatment, an analysis that has proven valuable in other immunotherapy arenas. This approach will maximize the potential data obtained from HIS mouse preclinical studies to advance the very best treatments. The two-year project will accomplish the following: Aim 1 Develop an integrated ?flow cell? consumable cartridge, with a >28-plex single-cell protein panel to evaluate human T cell response in HIS (humanized) mice and other genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). Aim 2: Develop an automated system to enable the handling of limited murine sample size and increase assay throughput, for larger-scale mouse screening studies in pre-clinical laboratories. Aims 3: Demonstrate proof-of-concept utility of this technology across four trials, for profiling polyfunctional response in HIS mice and other GEMMs, advancing biomarkers that lead to success in human treatments."
"9451815","Description: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the fastest growing developmental disability affecting more than 2 million US children and tens of millions worldwide. Children with ASD are 5 times more likely to have mealtime challenges and be picky eaters, which in part has been attributed to restrictive and ritualistic behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivity. These nutritional difficulties pose significant every day challenges for caregivers when it comes to child feeding and daily eating routines and call for new and innovative ways to promote healthy eating in children affected by ASD. The use of mobile technologies is rapidly increasing in children across all age groups. Children with ASD, in particular, often engage with mobile devices on a daily basis and mobile health (mHealth) technology has been shown to be an effective tool for improving behavioral, social, and communication skills in children with ASD. We aim to harness the lure of technology and develop and test, for the first time, the feasibility and acceptability of an interactive mHealth nutrition intervention for children with ASD. This intervention will build upon core behavior change strategies that have been empirically tested in family-based nutrition research for over 3 decades. A second aim of this project is to test, in a 3- month randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of the mHealth intervention on changing consumption of targeted healthy and less healthy foods and beverages in 6- to 10-year-old children with ASD who are picky eaters. Primary outcomes of this proof-of-concept trial will include 3-month changes in children's daily intake of fruits and vegetables, salty and sugary snacks, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Secondary outcomes will include parent and child engagement with the mHealth technology, motivation, user friendliness and ease of use. If successful, the use of this innovative mHealth nutrition intervention will offer new and powerful targets for intervention in improving dietary intake and the fight against childhood obesity in this especially vulnerable population of children."
"9334101","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune synovitis that affects 0.5% of the world population, yet the key autoantigen targets remain unknown. Production of autoantibodies, such as the anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), is a hallmark of RA. However, which antigens the critical ACPAs and other RA- associated autoantibodies target remains largely unknown. Also unknown is how these ACPAs develop, how similar the ACPA repertoires are between different individuals with RA, and whether and how they contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. So far, the research field has lacked the means to comprehensively characterize the autoantibodies associated with a given disease and to then rationally winnow them to those that are important-that is, those that either drive the disease or serve as identifiers of the key antigens that trigger the pathogenic T-cell response. We have now developed antibody repertoire capture technology, a high- throughput method that allows us to do just that. Harnessing the power of next-generation sequencing, we have developed a novel method for barcoding all the cDNAs generated from individual antibody-expressing cells, thereby enabling high-throughput analysis of the paired heavy- and light-chain immunoglobulin genes expressed by single B cells, plasmablasts, or plasma cells. We hypothesize that we can elucidate the pathogenic autoantibody responses associated with RA by defining the antibody repertoire of plasmablasts and antigen-sorted memory B cells in the blood, and of plasmablasts and plasma cells in the synovium, of individuals with RA. We will then bioinformatically analyze the antibody sequences we obtain to generate evolutionary trees of the antibody repertoires and thereby identify and clone the affinity-matured antibodies that are likely the key autoantibodies. We will identify the antigens targeted by these recombinant, affinity-matured autoantibodies, investigate how their specific sequences develop, dissect their binding and immunostimulatory properties, and assess their pathogenicity. Success of this proposal would shed light on the development of the autoantibody response and identify the key autoantigens targeted in RA, findings that could lead to the development of new diagnostics and therapies for RA."
"9484562","PROJECT SUMMARY At the intersection of race and gender are Black men who have the worst health profile of all American subgroups. Yet these is no ongoing longitudinal study that focuses exclusively on the Black men. We have created the Black Men's Health Project (BMHP), an initiative that focuses on issues related to Black men's health. The long-term goal of the BMHP is to enroll a large national panel of Black men ages 18 and older into a study to test the efficacy of web based health promotion interventions to improve their health and quality of life. A key component of the BMHP is the Black Men's Health Survey (BMHS)?a longitudinal study that uses internet survey methods and quota sampling to accrue a projected national sample of 5,000 Black men to advance knowledge of the health trajectory of Black men by assessing the health status, health behavior, and health-seeking practices across the life course. In addition to the health measures, the questionnaire includes concepts found to be important determinants of the health and health behavior of Black men (e.g., masculinity, microaggressions, etc.). Outcomes include cardiovascular risk, depressive symptoms, and physical functioning. The specific aims for the baseline data collection are to: 1) examine the psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with depressive symptoms on among Black men; 2) assess the relationship between psychosocial and behavioral factors and cardiovascular risk among Black men; and 3) determine the psychosocial and behavioral correlates of physical functioning in Black men. Findings from the BMHS will be used to inform subsequent research objectives using web based health promotion interventions to address unique risks associated with mental and physical health outcomes, and to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions."
"9506072","ABSTRACT Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at 50% greater risk for developing heart failure (HF) and HF- associated morbidity and mortality than non-RA controls. This risk persists even after adjustment for coronary artery disease, implying that immunologic and inflammatory factors intrinsic to RA contribute to the increased risk of HF. Our overall hypothesis is that myocardial inflammation and microvascular ischemia are prevalent in RA patients, are mediated by antibodies to myocardial citrullinated proteins, promote impairment of left ventricular (LV) structure/function, and are attenuated with RA therapies. Indeed, in 128 RA patients without clinical CVD who underwent [18fluoro-deoxyglucose] positron emission-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) (the RHYTHM study), we observed FDG uptake (inflammation) in 35% and impaired myocardial blood flow reserve (MFR) in 29%. Both myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR were strongly associated with clinical and laboratory measures of RA disease activity; impaired MFR was also associated with higher LV mass, a known precursor of HF. These data suggest that myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR mediate, in part, early changes in LV structure/function that predate clinical HF; but it is critical to confirm these relationships in longitudinal studies. Proximal events that mediate myocardial pathology in RA are unknown. We hypothesize that antibodies against citrullinated myocardial proteins (APCAs) mediate, in part, this abnormal myocardial phenotype (inflammation and impaired MFR), leading to myocardial remodeling and ultimately to functional decline. Our preliminary data demonstrating seroreactivity in 30% of RHYTHM sera in a novel myocardial protein array support this hypothesis. A related question is whether tumor necrosis inhibitors (TNFi?s) affect myocardial inflammation. This is a far from insignificant question as TNFi?s were associated with increased HF hospitalizations and death in non-RA HF patients and their risk for HF in RA is still unclear despite widespread use. In the next funding period, we seek to extend the study period for the RHYTHM cohort for aims 1 and 3, and to utilize an independently funded study (TARGET) for aim 2, in order to investigate the following aims: 1) To determine if imaging indicators of myocardial pathology at baseline (inflammation, impaired MFR) are predictive of longitudinal (adverse) change in measures of LV structure and function over 4-6 years in RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. 2) To determine, in a currently enrolling NIH-NIAMS funded randomized clinical trial (the TARGET study), if RA therapies reduce myocardial inflammation. 3) To determine if seroreactivity to citrullinated myocardial antigens in RHYTHM participants is associated with baseline myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR and/or with change over time in parameters of LV structure/function. These investigations will advance understanding of mechanisms that contribute to and mitigate increased risk of myocardial dysfunction in RA."
"9467200","Clinical Study of an Extended-Patency Dialysis Access Graft PROJECT SUMMARY Objective: The goals of this PAR-17-034 ?Clinical Studies Fast-Track? SBIR proposal are to move a novel hemodialysis access graft design to 510(k) submission, and upon 510(k) clearance, conduct a 25-patient clinical study to demonstrate improved performance compared to current synthetic grafts, which have high rate of clotting failure (40% patency at 1 year). Preclinical large animal studies of the novel design (ePTFE grafts treated on the venous end with a textured microporous silicone outer layer) have shown markedly superior patency and reduction of neointimal hyperplasia compared to untreated ePTFE controls. Significance: The need for frequent treatments (at least 3x per week) makes maintenance of reliable vascular access for hemodialysis patients extremely challenging. As a result of high maturation failure in autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistulas (the preferred vascular access option) and a reluctance to use synthetic AV grafts (the safest alternative) due to poorer patency, more than half of all first-year hemodialysis patients, and more than 20% longer term, are treated via unsafe ?last-resort? infection-prone catheters. Loss of patency by AV grafts is primarily due to development of neointimal hyperplasia at the venous anastomosis, which causes progressive stenosis (narrowing) of the lumen, leading to unstable low flow followed by thrombosis failure (occlusion). Successful clinical introduction of an AV graft overcoming the neointimal hyperplasia problem would increase access options, and especially, enable a significant reduction in the use of high-risk catheters. Innovation: This approach is a new way to address the neointimal hyperplasia problem. By treating ePTFE grafts with an exterior biointerface that prevents a fibrotic encapsulation response from the surrounding tissue, the usual mechanical constriction effects from capsular contraction are eliminated. This provides freedom for the graft wall to flex in response to the pulsatile blood flow at the anastomosis, alleviating the unfavorable oscillating stresses in the neointima that ordinarily trigger neointimal thickening. The end result is prevention of the usual stenosis at the venous outflow and preservation of long-term stable flow. Design refinements on the antifibrotic biointerface, verified in our preclinical studies, allow this to be applied only to the venous end of the AV graft, using innovative coverage patterns that preserve stable high flow This removes approval risks associated with full-length coverage (e.g., kinking, cannulation concerns), allowing a clear approval path while preserving efficacy in preventing venous-end stenosis. The preclinical results suggest a high major leap in clinical use reliability. Impact: Successful commercialization of an AV graft with superior long-term patency would improve patient safety and quality of life by enabling significant reductions in the use of high-risk catheters and the number of hospitalizations related to vascular access complications. v0.04"
"9436717","Project Summary  Metabolic reprogramming is recognized as a hallmark of cancer cells, and a deeper understanding of these metabolic changes can lead to the development of novel and promising therapeutics. Activation of de novo lipid synthesis and epigenetic reprogramming are both common features of many cancers. Acetyl-CoA is the metabolic building block for newly synthesized lipids in the cell. Deregulated lipid synthesis is a key problem in metabolic disorders, and has been shown to support tumor growth. Acetyl-CoA is also the donor substrate for all histone and non-histone protein acetylation. Previous studies in our lab show that histone acetylation is metabolically sensitive in cancer cell lines and tissues in vivo. How metabolic regulation of histone acetylation subsequently affects gene expression and signaling in tumorigenesis remains an area of active investigation. Another hallmark of cancer is the ability to evade immune detection or destruction through a wide variety of mechanisms. Studies identifying metabolic rewiring of immune cells during differentiation or activation have prompted research into how immunometabolism is disrupted within tumors to suppress anti- tumor immunity. However, the exact mechanisms of interplay between cancer and immune cell metabolism within a tumor remain largely unknown.  The aims presented in the pre-doctoral phase of this proposal are designed to further understand the role of cellular metabolism in promoting tumorigenesis. In Aim 1, I investigate the role of ACLY in regulating processes such as de novo lipid synthesis and histone acetylation in cells using genetic and pharmacological perturbations of cellular metabolism coupled with mass-spectrometry based metabolomic techniques and other biochemical methods. In Aim 2, my previous findings will be translated in vivo to investigate how ACLY loss impacts hepatocellular carcinoma development in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which has been identified as a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in human patients. I will utilize a dietary stress and carcinogen-induced model of HCC in mice harboring a liver-specific knockout of Acly to study how processes such as de novo lipid synthesis and epigenome remodeling are impacted in this context. The ultimate goal of these aims is to define ACLY functions in cellular metabolism in the context of dietary stress and hepatocellular carcinoma for the application of ACLY inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy in the prevention and treatment of HCC. In Aim 3, I propose to build upon the technical and conceptual expertise in cellular and tumor metabolism acquired in my pre-doctoral training by pursuing a post-doctoral fellowship in tumor immunology and immunometabolism. I describe potential methods to investigate how metabolic reprogramming by cancer cells can impact immune cell function within a tumor. The goal of these studies is to identify how modulating cancer or immune cell metabolism can favor anti-tumor immune responses to develop novel therapeutic strategies."

PROJECT SUMARY ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this Pain Management Collaboratory Demonstration project is to implement a new Whole Health paradigm for chronic pain care, emphasizing non-pharmacologic pain self-management that reduces pain symptoms and improves overall functioning and quality of life in veterans. The objective of this UG3/UH3 proposal is to develop and pilot components that will be used to support a pragmatic implementation-effectiveness trial of two pain care delivery approaches that differ in structure, comprehensiveness, and intensity. During the trial phase, over 600 veterans across 4 geographically diverse VA health care facilities with moderate to severe chronic pain (irrespective of chronic opioid therapy) will be randomized to receive an intensive Whole Health Team (WHT) versus a less intensive usual care Primary Care Group Education (PC-GE) approach. All enrolled veterans will be followed for 12 months. In preparation for the trial, specific aims of the 2-year UG3 phase include: UG3 Aim 1: to use an evidence-based implementation framework to conduct a formative evaluation that engages trial stakeholders at the 4 VA enrolling sites, solicits feedback on specific trial components, and identifies barriers to and facilitators of trial implementation, and UG3 Aim 2: to use stakeholder input to adapt, pilot and refine key components for the successful implementation of the pragmatic trial including: non-pharmacologic multi-modal pain self- management education for patients and providers, point-of-care data collection applications, patient reported measures sensitive to whole health interventions, wrist-worn activity monitors, and web/mobile applications to support in vivo monitoring of activity and pain and to provide tools for pain self-management. Assuming transition to the 4-year trial UH3 phase, we will implement these components refined in the UG3 phase. In UH3 Aim 1 we will conduct a 12-month pragmatic effectiveness trial to test whether veterans with moderate to severe chronic pain randomized to receive the Whole Health Team (WHT) intervention are more likely than those receiving Primary Care Group Education (PC-GE) to: H1: Experience improved pain severity and interference, functioning and quality of life (primary outcome); H2: Decrease use of higher risk pain medications, including opioids, or high risk combinations (secondary); H3: Engage in a greater number of non- pharmacological pain management activities (secondary); H4: Experience improved comorbid mental health symptoms, including sleep problems and suicidality. UH3 Aim 2 is to conduct a process evaluation and budget impact analysis of the implementation of the two interventions to support the development of an implementation toolkit for scaling and dissemination. Results of this UG3/UH3 Pain Management Collaboratory Demonstration project will contribute to the overall mission of the NIH/VA/DoD initiative to build national-level infrastructure that supports non-pharmacologic pain management in veterans and military service personnel."
"9453929","We propose to utilize the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), a PAGE Phase 1 study, to sample and assess genomic variation in well-phenotyped individuals of non-European (EA) ancestry. The MEC is a prospective population-based cohort of over 215,000 men and women in Hawaii and California that includes large representations of older adults for five racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Latinos, Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians and European Americans) at varying risks of chronic diseases. In the MEC, we have established a biorepository of blood and urine samples (N>74,000) linked to prospectively collected risk factor, biomarker and clinical/endpoint data. In PAGE2, we propose to explore the associations of DNA sequence variation for a broad range of phenotypes, focusing on conditions with disproportionate disease burdens in non-EAs. We propose to utilize the most comprehensive and cost-effective SNP genotyping array to capture and perform association tests in non-EA populations for: a) common and rare putative functional coding variation, and; b) predicted functional variants in ENCODE-defined regulatory elements in non-coding sequence at GWAS-identified risk loci. We will focus on diseases/traits/biomarkers that are common to PAGE2 studies and for which we have DNA available for large numbers of MEC subjects (e.g., type 2 diabetes, obesity, common cancers, fasting insulin, glucose, lipids, etc.). We will analyze single variants, risk scores, and burden of rare variants for single genes and pathways using both directional and omnibus methods. Using the comprehensive risk factor information available across PAGE2, we will also examine interactions between gene (e.g., SNP, risk score, burden), pathway and environment and build risk prediction models for the purpose of better defining the genetic contributions to racial/ethnic disparities in risk for common chronic diseases and traits. Last, we also propose to develop novel statistical methods and approaches for analyzing rare variants including: (a) an examination of kernel machine tests in the presence of subtle hidden population stratification; (b) extending the kernel machine methods to form tests of gene/pathway x environment and gene/pathway x gene/pathway interactions, and; (c) how to apply these methods to further characterize whether variants in specific pathways and their interactions explain racial/ethnic differences in risk. Working with other PAGE2 studies, the Coordinating Center and NHGRI, we hope to form a valuable population-based resource for the scientific community that will expand our understanding of ancestral differences in genomic disease associations and the role of genetic variation in understanding racial and ethnic differences in disease risk."
"9467262","This project provides the first step toward the long term goal of developing an enzyme drug for commercialization acting on the extracellular matrix to enhance the efficacy of broad range of cancer therapeutics in solid tumors. The extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding all cells is crucial for biological functions in tissues throughout the body. In solid tumors, the extracellular matrix can limit the ability of cancer drugs to penetrate and act on cancer cells. In this project we propose to engineer an enzyme that acts to specifically degrade the ECM in tumors, allowing cancer drugs to penetrate and act in tumors more effectively. Degradation of the ECM of solid tumors has been demonstrated both preclinically and clinically to to enhance a range of cancer drugs, including potentially traditional chemotherapeutics and newer agents such as antibodies and immuno-oncology agents. Previously used ECM degrading enzymes are not specific for tumors and degrade the ECM in peripheral tissues as well, leading to well-characterized, mechanistic, adverse events. These adverse events limit the dose of the ECM degrading enzymes which compromises the efficacy of the co-administered cancer drugs. This project proposes to target the activity of the ECM degrading enzyme to the tumor microenvironment, increasing the efficacy of co-administered cancer drugs, while also decreasing peripheral ECM degradation and reducing adverse events. To design this enzyme we will first use a computational approach to analyze the enzyme's structure and predict how changes in the enzyme might target enzyme action to the distinct conditions found associated with cancer in the tumor microenvironment. Second, based on these predictions we will create different versions of the target enzyme and test their activity in conditions representing the environment in tumors compared with conditions found in normal tissue, verifying that the predicted changes in the enzyme produce the desired activity specifically targeting tumors. Third, when a version, or versions, of the enzyme are found to specifically target the tumor microenvironment, we will produce larger quantities of this enzyme in preparation for future studies that will characterize the action of the enzyme in both cancer models, testing enhanced efficacy, and in safety models demonstrate the decrease of mechanistic adverse effects. The proposed outcome of this project will be an enzyme (or enzymes) suitable for preclinical pharmacology studies, the first step in producing a clinical candidate that would ultimately advance into testing in clinical trials, targeting pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors in which the extracellular matrix limits the action of cancer drugs."
"9469644","PROJECT SUMMARY  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating mood disorder that is diagnosed based on a mixture of symptoms, but anhedonia?decreased interest in rewarding activities?is a core feature. Anhedonia can be caused by an inability to experience pleasure or by a lack of motivation to work towards obtaining a reward. Every decision to exert effort to obtain a reward involves action valuation computations? essentially a cost-benefit analysis of whether the positive value of the expected outcome of an action outweighs the negative value of the expected effort associated with that action. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a stress-sensitive region of prefrontal cortex (PFC), has been consistently implicated in action valuation computations across species. Whether and how dysfunctional action valuation computations drive anhedonic symptoms in stress-related psychiatric disease is unclear. While extensive, groundbreaking work has characterized the effects of stress on PFC glutamatergic circuitry, less is known about the role of local inhibitory circuitry in stress-induced depressive-like behaviors, despite substantial evidence for changes in the inhibitory system in MDD patients. This work will investigate the role of one cellular subtype, somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons, in driving both healthy reward-seeking and chronic stress-induced anhedonic behavior. Our hypothesis is that SST interneurons facilitate action valuation computations by dynamically regulating synaptic inputs to the ACC and that hyperactivity in SST cells disrupts this process in chronic stress states. To test this, we will record the activity of the ACC SST interneuron population through a chronically implanted optical fiber (fiber photometry) in awake, freely behaving mice performing an effortful reward-seeking task under normal and chronically stressed conditions. We will then optogenetically manipulate the activity of these cells to identify specific causal roles for SST interneurons in driving healthy and pathological reward processing. This investigation will fill a substantial gap in our understanding of stress-induced anhedonic behavior by focusing on a sparse but essential cell population that is understudied in the context of stress and depression. !"
"9377475","Project Summary  During the menopause transition, many healthy women with no history of cognitive dysfunction experience subjective difficulties with sustained attention, motivation for work, organization and working memory. Indicators of risk for executive function difficulties at menopause are lacking, as is an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the unmasking of this vulnerability with loss of estradiol. The overarching purpose of this project is to determine whether early life adversity (adverse childhood experiences; ACE) and insults to the serotonergic system contribute to executive system dysfunction among menopausal women. Multi-modal imaging data from healthy, menopausal women with high and low numbers of adverse childhood experiences who have undergone tryptophan depletion, a paradigm used to lower central serotonin levels, will be used to characterize the effects of adverse childhood experiences and tryptophan depletion on behavioral and brain measures of executive function. I will determine the effect of the adverse childhood experiences and tryptophan depletion on executive performance, activation, and dynamic functional connectivity in menopausal women. Next, I will investigate the role of differences in grey matter volume and resting-state connectivity as explanatory factors underlying differences in executive activation associated with adverse childhood experiences and tryptophan. Then I will determine the role of estradiol in protecting against the effects of tryptophan depletion in women with high and low numbers of adverse childhood experiences.  Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide strong support for the mechanisms underlying new-onset cognitive dysfunction during menopause. Given the evidence supporting the early initiation of estrogen therapy in those who are candidates, results of this project have the potential to impact treatment and outcomes applicable to a large portion of the population. !"
"9351525","Project Summary Human immunodeficiency virus (HlV-1) is the etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The global HIV-1 pandemic (~35 million people infected) is sustained by 2-S million new infections annually. Changing the course of this pandemic requires prevention of HlV-1 transmission, most of which occurs sexually. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the use of specific antiretroviral drugs has been investigated and shown to protect, in a partial manner, at-risk sex partners from HIV-1 infection. However, partial efficacy, drug side effects, suboptimal compliance and the emergence of drug-resistant viruses limit the general applicability of these agents as prophylactic measures. New broadly active antiviral agents that can be used as topical microbicides hold the promise of addressing these deficiencies. The HlV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), which mediate virus entry into target cells, represent attractive targets for such prophylactic agents. The HIV-1 Envs are exposed on the viral surface, are accessible to water-soluble inhibitors and are present in low numbers on each virion. Env inhibitors used as microbicides need not be systemically absorbed or taken up by host cells, limiting potential toxicity. Conserved elements of Env mediate receptor binding, conformational changes, and membrane fusion, providing several potential targets for inhibition. Although some HIV-1 entry inhibitors have been identified, drug-resistant HlV-1 variants either exist naturally or develop during treatment. To identify new broad-range inhibitors of HIV-1 entry, we have developed and utilized an Env-dependent cell-cell fusion screening assay. To date, the primary screen has been conducted on more than 600,000 compounds. The hits from the primary screen are in the process of being confirmed and validated, and two novel HlV-1 Env inhibitors have been identified recently. In this project, specific and broad range inhibitors, including analogues modified to improve potency while retaining breadth, will be characterized. We will also identify the target protein, the mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 entry, and the binding site ofthe inhibitor. The proposed studies should permit us to classify inhibitors into groups; synergy or antagonism among the groups will also be explored. The inhibitors will serve as novel probes to understand the complex, multi-step process of HIV-1 entry, and could represent leads for prophylactic microbicides and treatments for already infected individuals."
"9256220","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV) for the treatment of advanced stage solid tumors. The prognosis for patients with advanced stage solid tumors remains poor and bio-therapeutics such as VVs have the potential to improve outcomes. While VVs have shown promising antitumor activity in early Phase clinical studies, few patients have been cured. This lack of efficacy is most likely due to the inability of VVs to kill all tumor  cells and/or induce effective antitumoral immune responses. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are key players in promoting tumor growth and creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, recent studies have shown that the inherent phagocytic capacity of TAMs can be harnessed to induce antitumor responses by blocking CD47 on tumor cells and provision of an opsonization signal using a chimeric molecule that consists of the high affinity ectodomain of SIRP? fused to the Fc region of IgG4 (SIRP?-Fc). We now propose to adapt this approach to oncolytic VVs and hypothesize that an oncolytic VV that is genetically modified to express SIRP?-Fc (SIRP?-Fc-VV) will have enhanced antitumor activity in comparison to unmodified VV. Local production of SIRP?-Fc should also be superior to the intermittent direct infusion of the protein, both because the concentration of SIRP?-Fc should be highest at the sites of tumor and because it reduces the risks of unwanted side effects associated with the systemic administration of SIRP?-Fc. Since macrophages are potent antigen presenting cells, we hypothesize further that SIRP?-Fc-VV-induced phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages will result in the induction of tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific T cells. We propose to test  our hypotheses in 2 interrelated research aims. Aim 1 generates SIRP?-Fc-VV and SIRP?-VV, and compares their ability to replicate in tumor cells and activate macrophages in vitro. Aim 2 will then evaluate the antitumor activity of SIRP?-Fc-VV and SIRP?-VV in the B16 melanoma model, and assess their ability to induce B16 TAA-specific T-cell responses. If successful, this approach could be readily applied to oncolytic viruses that are currently being developed for a broad range of solid tumors."
"9356672","Project Summary/Abstract New targeted therapies are urgently needed for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where little progress has been made in improving long-term patient survival despite significant inroads into understanding the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. We previously discovered spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as a new target in AML, with FLT3-ITD a biomarker of response to SYK inhibitors in AML cells. These findings become immediately translatable as numerous SYK inhibitors are entering clinical trials for patients with cancer, including AML. The translation of SYK inhibitors to the clinic for patients with AML is the focus of this project. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will study SYK activation in AML cell lines and patient blasts to determine whether SYK activation promotes resistance to current AML therapy. In this Aim, we will also determine whether SYK inhibitors synergize with drugs currently used to treat patients with AML, both in vitro and in vivo, to inform second- generation SYK inhibitor clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses and conduct unbiased functional genomic studies to identify resistance mechanisms to SYK inhibitors in AML. We expect that these experiments will inform new drug combinations for testing with SYK inhibitors. Aim 3 will focus on performing the correlative biology studies for two Phase I/II clinical trials testing SYK inhibitors in patients with AML. In this Aim, we will use next-generation sequencing of panels of leukemia-associated genes, immunohistochemistry and intracellular phospho-specific flow cytometry to measure activated SYK, BH3 profiling, and gene expression signature assays to identify biomarkers of response to SYK inhibitors and to confirm target inhibition using AML samples from patients treated on the clinical trial. At the completion of this study, we expect to confirm on-target, anti-leukemia activity of a SYK inhibitor in patients with AML and to inform second- generation clinical trials through the identification of drug combinations with SYK inhibitors and through the identification of biomarkers of response in patients with AML treated with a SYK inhibitory drug."

"9446487","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based psychological intervention that is effective for reducing pain and improving function for patients with chronic pain. Numerous barriers exist to face-to-face delivery of this treatment, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-person sessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Leveraging technology-based interventions, like interactive voice response (IVR), which allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, may improve access to CBT-CP. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a pragmatic trial to examine the real world effectiveness of an IVR-based form of CBT-CP called COoperative Pain Education and Self-management (COPES). In the spirit of pragmatic trials, our approach will minimize clinic disruption and avoid adding research staff in the field by using the VHA?s electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate recruitment and to collect data, all while delivering COPES from a centralized VA location. In preparation for the pragmatic trial, the initial study phase (UG3) will: a) identify facilities to participate in the trial from among the 60 Women?s Health Practice Based Network (WH-PBRN) sites, b) examine the adequacy of the EHR for providing outcome data, c) determine the feasibility of using EHR provider alerts to promote recruitment and d) secure all regulatory approvals along with support from leadership at selected sites. Phase two (UH3) will then compare outcomes among Veterans randomized to either: 1) COPES, a 10-week IVR-based CBT and walking program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain treatments (COPES+UC), or 2) in-person CBT-CP provided by clinicians, previously trained through VHA?s evidence based psychotherapy program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (VHA CBT-CP+UC). Patients will be compared on a composite measure of pain intensity and functioning, EHR pain intensity, and health care use including emergency department, urgent care, and specialty pain services along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain interventions. Uptake and variation in outcomes across groups will also be evaluated where treatment disparities are possible (e.g. by sex, race, mental health comorbidities). Additionally, the cost of the COPES intervention will be examined, including intervention delivery expenditures and budget impact analysis. Finally, evaluation of the intervention process will be informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). CFIR-guided interviews with study site clinicians and administrators will assess experiences with the COPES and CBT-CP interventions and implementation findings will be communicated with participating sites and stakeholders."
"9427492","Abstract  Human O-GlcNAcase (OGA) regulates a wide variety of essential biological processes by hydrolyzing O- GlcNAcylation from numerous proteins in response to nutrient and stress. Even though dysregulated OGA has been indicated in many diseases, little is known about how OGA's function is regulated. Dynamic function of OGA is mainly reflected by the changes of its substrate specificity, which is challenging to be characterized. One part of the challenge is the lack of information on OGA substrate recognition, as no apparent sequence motif can be defined in its substrate proteins. The other part of the challenge is the paucity of strategies to investigate OGA's substrate targeting and regulatory mechanism in cells. As a breakthrough in the field, we recently solved the first crystal structures of human OGA, revealing a unique structural feature that could contribute to substrate recognition. We propose to further characterize OGA's substrate specificity by solving new structures of OGA in complex with various substrates. We also propose to develop an innovative strategy to profile OGA's physiological substrates and binding partners in an effort to uncover the molecular signatures underlying the functional dysregulation of OGA in cancer development and programmed cell death. This study will provide unprecedented insights into the critical role of OGA in coupling O-GlcNAc biology to modulation of cell survival and death."
"9304993","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment-resistant and aggressive tumors that cannot be fully and safely resected with surgery, and recur despite chemo- and radio-therapies, cause the lowest survival rate and quality of life among cancer patients. This over-arching oncology problem will be addressed with novel physical approaches to create self-regulated cell level cancer treatment. This will be realized through on-demand physical intracellular non-stationary events whose efficacy is self-amplified in cells with cancer aggressiveness, and whose safety is ensured by their stealth and cancer cell-specific nature. Such event is plasmonic nanobubble (PNB) - an intracellular explosion triggered with a short laser pulse around an intracellular cluster of plasmonic (gold) colloids that remain safe and passive until activated. Intracellular PNB creates the mechanical non-stationary threshold-activated effects that detect and destroy cancer cells and efficiently convert surgery, chemo- and radio-therapies into the cell level modality through a simple protocol by using low doses of only clinically-approved components. The innovative nature of this physical approach in cancer is in merging the mechanical event with the biological mechanisms to transform current macro-medicine into a cancer cell-specific on-demand intracellular treatment. The intracellular synergy of three PNB effects - mechanical intracellular impact, intracellular drug ejection from internalized liposomes and amplification of the external radiation - radically amplifies the therapeutic efficacy as compared to standard material-based treatments, and this therapeutic amplification increases with the gold cluster size which is driven by the cancer aggressiveness. This proposal will explore the hypothesis that that the mechanical impact of PNB will overcome cancer resistance and will convert standard surgery and chemo- and radio- therapies into a cell level on-demand modality whose efficacy will be self-amplified by cancer cell aggressiveness. This approach will be studied in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a model. The project will analyze the biological response of cancer cells to non-stationary intracellular mechanical impact in vitro and physiological response of resistant and aggressive tumor to non-stationary mechanical impact in vivo to radically amplify the efficacy of standard treatments without increasing their doses and non- specific toxicity. As a result, the self-regulated intracellular therapeutic PNB-based mechanisms (mechanical drugs) will be developed to treat aggressive and resistant tumors, and will estimate optimal clinical applications of PNB mechanisms within existing standards of care. The project will bring several benefits. In science, the multifunctiona intracellular PNBs will merge the physical and biological approaches in  novel therapeutic mechanisms. In oncology, PNBs will support the intracellular amplification of standard clinical modalities when the latter fail, will broaden the patient eligibility by offering a safe, new treatment to those patients who currently are referred only to palliative care and will offer a new efficient use of standard under-recognized drugs currently considered inefficient."

"9558812","Project Summary: Overall The Kids First Data Resource will aggregate genetic and clinical data from childhood cancer and structural birth defects patient cohorts together so that researchers can mine the data to uncover entirely new ways of understanding childhood cancer and structural birth defects. Children with birth defects are at a higher risk of also developing childhood cancer, suggesting that there are shared genetic pathways underlying some types of childhood cancer and structural birth defects. Analyzing genetic sequence data from children with childhood cancer and structural birth defects together may lead to the discovery of new genetic pathways that would not have been uncovered had the analysis only been performed using childhood cancer data alone, or vice versa. These new pathways may help researchers discover novel treatments. The current lack of available resources for researchers to perform these types of dual analyses are potentially impeding the ability to uncover new biological contributions to childhood cancer and structural birth defects, thus slowing the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures. The Kids First Data Resource will 1) establish a pediatric cancer and birth defects data ecosystem supporting the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Portal and the empowered use of the Kids First data cohorts 2) integrate with leading edge NIH platforms and associated portals to allow researchers to perform these types of analyses and hopefully accelerate research toward more effective preventions and therapies. The Kids First Data Resource will provide many valuable services to the research community, such as: ? Serve as a centralized database to assemble dispersed data sources together into one location.  Integrating data together increases the power researchers have for detecting new genetic pathways  underlying childhood cancer and structural birth defects. These new pathways may help researchers  discover novel treatments. ? Provide easy access to and querying of disparate data sets by researchers without bioinformatics  expertise. Increasing the utility of genetics data maximizes its potential to yield new clues into the  causes of childhood cancer and structural birth defects. ? Provide analytical tools for analyzing large and complex data sets encompassing genetic sequence and  clinical data. ? The Kids First Data Resource will be widely available to researchers across the entire biomedical  research community. Kids First will support projects that use the data within the Kids First Data  Resource to either uncover new insights into the biology of childhood cancer and structural birth defects  or to develop new computational methods for analyzing genetics data. The Kids First Data Resource  also will be available for researchers to use in their own studies supported by other funding sources.  This is then expected to stimulate research toward more effective preventions and therapies for diverse conditions."
"9423684","PROJECT SUMMARY The 15 million children in the United States who live in families below the poverty line are at risk for serious health problems ranging from chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes to mental health problems such as depression and substance use disorders. Many childhood interventions target low-income and high-risk children, with evidence that some early interventions improve adult health and wellbeing. However, little is known about whether, and how, the benefits of childhood interventions get transmitted across generations. This study asks whether children who benefit from early interventions grow up to become better parents and, subsequently, have children who experience fewer health problems, educational challenges, and emotional problems. We bring together two longstanding, ongoing, prospective intervention studies that follow panels of children into adulthood. Published findings show that each intervention has positive impact on a child?s adjustment, but it is not known whether this impact transfers to the next generation. The first is a quasi-experiment in which a positive income shock due to a casino opening resulted in an unearned cash transfer to American Indian children?s families. These families had already been participating in the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS), an accelerated longitudinal cohort study now entering its fourth decade, with detailed measures available pre-intervention, post-intervention, and into adulthood. The second is the Fast Track (FT) Prevention Randomized Controlled Trial that randomly assigned 891 kindergarten children at risk for serious behavior problems to intervention and control conditions. Published findings indicate positive impact at least through age 26. Participants from both studies are now in their mid-30s and are currently completing or preparing for another wave of assessments with high rates of study retention. We will collect identical measures of risks to parenting, parenting environments, and parenting behaviors and information on the over 5000 offspring of these study members via a harmonized parent and offspring survey, a low-cost daily virtual assessment of parenting and child wellbeing, and high quality educational and birth records. We test whether the positive income shock, or separately, random assignment to the FT intervention in childhood, improves future parenting and, subsequently, offspring adjustment. For GSMS, we conduct an innovative population-wide extension to include all children aged 8 to 18 living in the counties where the income shock occurred. We test hypotheses about which subgroups (e.g., highest risk, females, those showing maximal initial impact) are most likely to likely to pass on benefits of the intervention to their own children, and which mechanisms mediate intervention impact. Our findings will inform prevention science by testing whether, for whom, and how, the effects of human capital interventions are transmitted across generations. Our findings speak directly to the costs and benefits of contemporary public policy as both interventions reflect features of policies and programs that currently serve millions of high-risk children and families in the United States."
"9535556","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pathologic bone resorption due to osteoporosis, fragility fractures and cancers pose a significant economic burden to healthcare costs and lost wages. These osteolytic diseases share a similar pathophysiology, so understanding the mechanisms of bone resorption greatly aids the search for treatment options. The need to develop therapeutic options with minimal side effects is strong, but requires greater elucidation into the mechanisms of inflammatory bone resorption. We previously confirmed the role of pERK1/2 on the production of pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines such as RANKL, MCSF, COX-2 and IL-1b. Then, we focused on a seemingly overlooked target for inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, IL-1b, an inflammatory cytokine implicated in pathologic osteolysis. An IL-1b Converting Enzyme (ICE, or Caspase-1) inhibitor showed dramatic inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. However, Caspase-1inhibitor -/- osteoclast precursors did not demonstrate impaired osteclastogenesis, implying off-target components to this osteolysis-inhibition mechanism. Subsequently, our proteomic screening efforts yielded us Calregulin (CRG) as our osteoclastogenic-inhibition focus. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies met with great success as administration of recombinant human Calregulin (rhCRG) demonstrated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in vitro in osteoclast-precursor macrophages and inhibition of LPS-induced osteolysis in vivo. rhCRG inhibited NFATc1 among several osteoclastogenic transcription factors. The new direction of this competitive renewal is to test a novel hypothesis that Calregulin inhibits osteoclastogenesis in vitro and inflammation-associated osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Therefore, our aims for this proposal employ 3 parallel Aims to determine mechanisms and therapeutic translation in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1 will determine mechanisms by which rhCRG interferes with key osteoclastogenic pathways such as NFATc1 in vitro. We will determine whether rhCRG interferes with osteoclastogenic gene expression, calcium oscillation, NFATc1 activity, and bone resorption. In addition, we will examine whether rhCRG/NFATc1 functionally interact with 6 candidate proteins which we identified on Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry of His-CRG pulled-down proteins. Aim 2 will determine whether CRG regulates macrophage activation in inflammatory osteolysis in vitro and in vivo. Macrophage activation of M1 or M2 plays pro- and anti-inflammatory roles, respectively. By determining the CRG's role in the polarization of M2 macrophages and inhibition of M1, we will establish an alternative mechanism. Aim 3 will establish a therapeutic role of topical rhCRG in inflammatory osteolysis in vivo. We will induce osteolysis with clinically relevant RANKL, TNF and LPS to determine whether rhCRG can prevent or treat inflammation-associated osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. We will measure bone protective effects of rhCRG using Cathepsin K molecular imaging, dynamic bone histomorphometry and TRAP staining. Overall impact is high in that we expect to unravel novel anti-osteoclastogenic mechanisms and therapeutic promise of rhCRG in the context of inflammatory osteolysis."
"9459039","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to tell time, predict the movement of other animals, and decode complex temporal patterns- such as those in speech-are among the brain's primary functions. As such, we would put forth that it will not be possible to understand the fundamental principles underlying brain function without understanding how the brain tells time and processes temporal information. We have proposed that precisely because timing is such a fundamental component to brain function that neural circuits in general are capable of processing temporal information-that is, timing does not rely on specialized or centralized circuits. This theory posits that timing emerges from the neural dynamics of recurrent neural circuits, and predicts that even neural circuits in vitro may be able to learn to tell time.  We hae recently provided evidence that timing is a general computation of cortical networks. Specifically, by chronically exposing slices in the incubator to patterned stimuli (mimicking sensory experience) we have shown that the neural dynamics reproduces the temporal features of the experienced stimuli. Here we will use novel electrical and optogenetic methods to demonstrate that cortical circuits in vitro can learn temporal patterns, and elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms of timing and cortical computations. We propose that studying network-level forms of learning in reduced preparations is necessary to understand cortical computations because of the limitations of in vivo studies. Additionally, the ability to study network behavior and `learning' in vitro will provide a means to study pathological circuit level computations using tissue from animal models of cognitive disorders."
"9495274","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Essential tremor affects 0.5-0.9% of the general population and about 4.5% of those above age 65. Medications for tremor are re-purposed drugs found empirically rather than through laboratory research. As such they lack potency and specificity, and are often not well tolerated. In our program we seek to identify molecular targets to which anti-tremor drugs could be designed, offering greater on-target specificity and potency. A clue is that patients often report that as little as 1-2 glasses of wine can suppress tremor. Brain mapping studies in essential tremor indicate that hyper-oscillatory activity within circuits of the cerebellum underlies tremor. When patients are given low doses of alcohol, not only does the tremor diminish, but excessive activity in the cerebellar cortex also diminishes. We postulate that low-dose alcohol works on tremor by activating GABAA receptors that contain alpha6, beta3 and delta subunits, found only in the cerebellar cortex. If we can show that this receptor can mediate tremor suppression, it could represent an important target for anti-tremor therapy. The GABAA receptor is a pentamer made of alpha, beta, and either gamma or delta subunits. Delta GABAA receptors exert tonic inhibition, and are much more sensitive to GABA. Studies with receptors expressed in cells, and with brain slices, have shown that THIP, muscimol and neurosteroids such as ganaxolone selectively activate delta GABAA receptors rather than gamma GABAA receptors. In addition, ethanol in the range of 1-2 glasses of wine has been found to activate those delta GABAA receptors that use beta3 subunits. We hypothesize that activation of delta GABAA receptors by THIP, muscimol, ganaxolone, and low-dose alcohol will suppress tremor in the harmaline model of essential tremor in wild-type but not littermate delta knockout mice. In addition, the tremor-suppressing effect of alcohol in wild-type mice should be reversed by the alcohol antagonist Ro15-4513, providing further evidence that alcohol is suppressing tremor via a GABAA receptor. We use the harmaline tremor model, which has many similarities to tremor of essential tremor. Motion power is digitally analyzed to provide measures of motion in the tremor bandwidth as a ratio of overall motion power. Our pilot data indicate that THIP, muscimol, ganaxolone, and low-dose alcohol all suppress harmaline tremor in wild-type but not in delta knockout mice. The effect of low-dose alcohol was blocked by Ro15-4513. We propose to replicate these findings (Aim 1). The delta subunit is associated with either alpha 4 or with alpha 6 in GABAA receptors. The alpha4- delta receptors mediate sedation and motor impairment when activated, whereas no behavior has previously been found associated with alpha6-delta receptor activation. Our pilot experiments showed that THIP and low-dose alcohol suppress harmaline tremor in wild-type but not in alpha6 knockout mice, indicating the alpha6-delta receptor mediates tremor suppression. We propose to replicate this finding and test ganaxolone as well (Aim 2). GABAA receptors containing alpha6-delta are found only in the cerebellar cortex, where they associate with beta3, beta2 or beta1. The next step is to investigate whether cerebellar beta3 is important for tremor suppression by these delta-receptor acting drugs by breeding mice with beta3 missing in the part of the cerebellum where alpha6 is expressed (Aim 3). It is anticipated that beta3 will be critical for low-dose alcohol's anti-tremor action, but itmay not be critical for THIP or ganaxolone. Should appropriate strains of knockout mice become available, we will test whether beta2 or beta1 are important for mediating the anti-tremor action of THIP and ganaxolone. These experiments are expected to lead to the identification of a GABAA receptor subtype, alpha6-beta2/3- delta, found only in the cerebellar cortex that will constitute a molecular target to which anti-tremor therapies can be designed to activate. Such a therapy, through its high selectivity, is anticipated to be potent and well tolerated. As the first drug to be developed specifically for essential tremor from laboratory research, it would be expected to confer greater efficacy than existing drugs, preventing disability and loss of occupation in veterans with essential tremor."
"9386895","Center for Research on the Respiratory Microbiota of African Children (ReMAC): Abstract The microbiota (community of microorganisms) of the upper airways plays a key role in the development of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. Most of the important bacterial LRTI pathogens also colonize the nasopharynx (NP), which often serves as the source of infection for LRTI in a child as well as the reservoir for transmission to other children. We have assembled an interdisciplinary collaboration between investigators at three leading African research institutions, in South Africa, The Gambia and Malawi, and a leading genomic center in the USA to address key questions on the determinants, composition and biological significance of the microbiota of the upper airways in African children. We will leverage several large existing cohorts and sample repositories to conduct three complementary but not co-dependent research projects, each done at multiple African sites. The first project will focus on comprehensive description of the NP microbiota (bacterial, fungal and viral components) in healthy African children over the first year of life, using longitudinal, frequently sampled cohorts. We will also study the role of the NP microbiota in resistance to colonization with the respiratory pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae, including modulation of vaccine-induced protection. The second project will investigate the role of the NP microbiota, including consideration of antimicrobial resistance, in the incidence, severity, and recurrence of LRTI in African children. The third project will examine the association between seasonality, inhaled environmental exposures (or pollutants), the household dust microbiota, and the microbiota of the NP and oropharynx in children from South Africa and The Gambia. We will use amplicon sequencing to define the bacterial and fungal components of the microbiota, targeted nucleic acid amplification testing for the viral component, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to complement, validate and extend our findings. We will apply statistical modeling tools, including those derived from ecology, to understand the evolution of, interactions within, and determinants of, the microbiota. We will develop a Center for Research into the Respiratory Microbiota of African Children (ReMAC) which will build capacity for respiratory microbiota research in Africa, by establishing a sustainable, collaborative network of African and US investigators, with focus on specialized training, postgraduate study, technology transfer and career development. Successful completion of the proposed work will enhance our understanding of the ecology of the nasopharynx and of the pathogenesis of LRTI, promote the development of diagnostic or prognostic tools for children with LRTI, provide insight into whether therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota may be desirable and identify modifiable risk factors which negatively influence the composition of the microbiota.  1"
"9445128","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase inhibitors created a new paradigm in chemotherapy and are a major focus of new oncology drug development, but developmental success rates are low (5-10%). Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed kinome reprogramming). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore. In Aim 1, we will establish quantitative assays for activity (and therefore inhibition) of key kinases in drug sensitive and drug resistant CML cells, profiling the pathway activation phenotypes in therapeutically relevant cellular states. We will use the set of biosensors we have already established in preliminary work, and add biosensors for other kinases as they are developed. The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development."
"9312127","Aging is the major non-modifiable stroke risk factor in humans, and ischemic stroke is highly prevalent in aged Veterans and other Americans, with an economic burden exceeding $70 billion/year. Furthermore, the rate and the degree of functional recovery in aged stroke patients, as in aged animal models of stroke, are slower than in the young. In the aged brain, excitotoxicity-induced sustained neuronal peroxynitrite production is more prominent, causing sustained calpain activation and thus neurodegeneration. We observed that this deleterious activity of peroxynitrite can be blocked by S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a reaction product of NO and glutathione. GSNO inhibits neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-derived peroxynitrite formation in mouse models of stroke. Therefore, using aged mouse models, we propose to investigate the critical roles of peroxynitrite versus GSNO in functional recovery from stroke.  Mechanistic stroke studies using animal-derived cell culture models have not been validated in humans, frustrating the development of mechanism-based neuroprotective human stroke therapy. Therefore, we propose using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human neurons to investigate the effect of peroxynitrite versus GSNO-mediated mechanisms in excitotoxicity-induced toxicity under stroke conditions.  Studies on the regulation of nNOS/calpain system indicate that a complete irreversible inhibition using specific inhibitors of nNOS/calpain limits not only the cellular insult but also vital physiologic functions. In contrast, the proposed GSNO-mediated reversible inhibition of nNOS and calpain offers a novel approach which we hypothesize will be effective by maintaining physiologic function and inhibiting pathological activities.  We hypothesize that deleterious activities of the nNOS/peroxynitrite/calpain system are maintained more persistently in the aged than the young stroke brain. High levels of peroxynitrite and up regulated activity of calpains cause profound neurodegeneration, whereas, GSNO, via the mechanism of S- nitrosylation, reversibly inhibits the activities of nNOS and calpain to reduce peroxynitrite-induced neurodegeneration and accelerate functional recovery in aged stroke mice. The hypothesis will be tested via two specific aims. Specific aim 1 elucidates the regulatory mechanisms through which GSNO inhibits the deleterious nNOS/peroxynitrite/calpain system under stroke conditions in iPSC-derived human neuronal culture model. Specific Aim 2 investigates whether GSNO aids and accelerates functional recovery by blocking the deleterious nNOS/peroxynitrite/calpain system in aged mouse stroke models.  Expected outcomes include elucidation of GSNO-mediated mechanisms for inhibition of the nNOS/peroxynitrite/calpain system and functional recovery in aged animals. iPSC-derived human neurons will provide a new tool to understand the mechanisms of human stroke injury, leading to the development of a therapy of translational value for stroke survivors including senior citizens and Veterans. GSNO is a component of the human brain and body, and its efficacy has been documented in several animal models of neurovascular, cardiovascular and vascular diseases."
"9566374","PROJECT SUMMARY The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), primarily associated with cigarette smoking (CS), including emphysema and bronchitis, remain unclear. Our published studies have suggested that autophagy, a lysosome-dependent pathway for the degradation of organelles and proteins, represents a major cellular and tissue response to CS exposure, in both experimental and human COPD lung. Emerging studies suggest that autophagy, while well established as a cellular survival process, can exert homeostatic or detrimental effects in complex diseases. Our studies were the first to demonstrate deleterious effects of autophagy and mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in experimental models of COPD. Mice genetically deficient in the mitophagy regulator PINK1 were resistant to experimental COPD. We discovered that mitophagy induced by CS in response to mitochondrial dysfunction activates programmed epithelial cell death, in particular the necroptosis mode of cell death. Our Preliminary Studies indicate that CS exposure can disrupt metabolic pathways, including dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and inhibition of fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Hence, we put forth the following Hypothesis: CS exposure causes epithelial cell metabolic disruption and impaired FA synthesis that causes mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to activation of PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Mitophagy in turn drives a pro-pathogenic mechanism dependent on the activation of necroptosis. Activation of this mitophagy-dependent necroptosis pathway in response to metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction may adversely affect airway function and emphysema outcomes during CS-induced COPD pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will address three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms by which CS induces mitophagy in the lung. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of impaired OXPHOS and FA synthesis on the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis and their impact on experimental COPD. Specific Aim 3: To determine the regulation of cellular necroptosis by CS, and its impact on lung functional impairment in experimental models of COPD. "

"9477929","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss; for the greatest impact, it should be made available in the primary care setting where it can reach the many patients with overweight/obesity. We have developed a 3-month automated online behavioral weight loss program, Rx Weight Loss (RxWL), and shown that it produces clinically significant weight losses among primary care patients. Our early efforts at pragmatic implementation of RxWL have been promising, and have shed light on challenges associated with implementation, and the need to study longer-term effectiveness. We therefore propose to conduct a pragmatic study to improve the implementation and effectiveness of this behavioral obesity intervention delivered in routine and representative healthcare settings. We are partnering with the Rhode Island Primary Care Physicians Corporation (RIPCPC), a large primary care network of 58 practices with 100 physicians and 16 nurse care managers. Using the framework for Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Designs, we will simultaneously target effectiveness and implementation to maximize the public health impact of our research. We will randomly assign half of the 16 nurse care managers, and the practices they serve, to either Basic Implementation (alerts in the electronic medical record [EMR] to direct eligible patients to RxWL), or to the Enhanced Implementation (alerts, clinician skills training to motivate and support weight loss, clinician dashboard with reports on patient progress and tools to facilitate patient engagement and behavior change). We will test the hypothesis that the Enhanced Implementation will increase the proportion of patients directed to, enrolling, and completing the weight loss program. Because maintenance of weight loss is a critical problem, this project will also involve randomization of 600 patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or hypercholesterolemia to the 3 month RxWL intervention followed by one of three maintenance conditions: (a) Control- 9 monthly online education sessions; (b) Monthly Lessons and Feedback- 9 monthly online video lessons teaching self-regulation with automated feedback on the self-monitoring record; (c) Refresher Campaigns- 9 monthly on-line video sessions, teaching self-regulation and providing two 4-week courses with novel strategies and behavioral challenges to improve long-term outcomes. We will test the hypothesis that 12-month weight losses are better with Refresher Campaigns than Monthly Lessons and Feedback, and both are better than Control. Secondary outcomes include changes in weight, CVD risk factors, and medication use over a full 24 months.  Our project is significant and innovative because: it uses an empirically validated approach to obesity treatment that is integrated into the primary care setting, leveraging existing staff and EMR capabilities; it has a dual focus on improving effectiveness and implementation; it has a pragmatic design in partnership with a large primary care network that treats a diverse patient population; and it has potential to it provides a scalable, sustainable approach that can serve as a model for broader dissemination of obesity treatment intervention."
"9444173","Abstract Motor cortex (M1) plays a crucial role in the control of voluntary movement but the neuronal mechanisms by which this region converges on downstream circuits remain obscure. To better understand how activity in M1 is translated into context-appropriate behaviors, we propose to characterize the role of specific cortical projection subtypes as defined by their spinal interneuron targets. A growing body of electrophysiological and behavioral evidence suggests that interneuron subsets in the spinal cord represent functional units that, when recruited, play a role in imposing a task-appropriate pattern of muscle activation. An example of this is seen in the alternating activity of opposing flexor and extensor muscles, which is in part regulated by defined spinal circuits. These circuits can be over-ridden to achieve simultaneous antagonist muscle coactivation. Two inhibitory spinal interneuron (IN) populations, presynaptic GABAergic (GABApre) and reciprocal inhibitory GABA/glycineric (Ia) neurons, play a role in this transition, undergoing activation or suppression of their activity, respectively. Using a recently developed CVS-N2C based rabies tracing strategy combined with genetic access to specific cardinal interneuron populations, we have identified that both classes receive direct corticospinal neuron (CSN) inputs. Moreover, this input has been suggested to play a role in the task-appropriate switching from alternating activation to co-activation of flexor-extensor muscle pairs. In order to investigate the nature of this role, we have developed a motor behavioral task in, which mice are trained to either alternate or co-contract opposing forelimb muscles in response to a visual cue. For the first time, we can now simultaneously monitor and manipulate the activity of defined subsets of CSNs during a motor-cortically dependent behavior."
"9391950","CANDIDATE: Matthew J. Rossman, Ph.D., is a new postdoctoral fellow in Integrative Physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder. In this NRSA application, Dr. Rossman seeks to conduct innovative translational research providing new insight into the efficacy of a novel mitochondria targeted antioxidant, mitoquinone (MitoQ), for reducing endothelial reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria (mtROS) and improving vascular function in late middle-aged and older (MA/O) adults. His immediate goal is to acquire the research training and professional skills necessary to transition to an independent investigator. His long-term goal is to become an extramurally funded scientist focusing on translational strategies to enhance cardiovascular function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases with aging. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Rossman's career development plan consists of: 1) acquiring new experimental techniques and approaches to strengthen his research skills; 2) further training in biostatistics; and 3) professional skills development via formal course work; attendance and presentations at weekly journal clubs, university seminars, and national scientific meetings; and regular interactions with his mentoring team. ENVIRONMENT: The environment for Dr. Rossman's training plan should be outstanding. The principal mentor, Dr. Seals, is an internationally recognized and NIH funded scientist with a strong record of successful mentoring in translational biomedical research pertaining to preservation of vascular function and health with aging. Consulting-mentor Dr. McQueen is director of biostatistics in several research centers on campus. Consulting-mentor Dr. Murphy is a biochemist and the developer of MitoQ, and therefore will be able to provide unique insight regarding its biological actions. RESEARCH: Age-related vascular endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), is caused by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability secondary to oxidative stress. A major contributor to age-associated vascular oxidative stress is excessive production of mtROS. MitoQ accumulates in the mitochondria and reduces mtROS in vivo. Preclinical findings from our lab indicate that 4 weeks of MitoQ supplementation in mice reverses age-related endothelial dysfunction by normalizing vascular mitochondrial superoxide production and oxidative stress. The goal of the proposed research is to translate these preclinical findings to humans by conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study to provide the first evidence for the efficacy of oral MitoQ supplementation to improve NO-mediated EDD in healthy MA/O adults with baseline endothelial dysfunction (Aim 1). To elucidate mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of MitoQ, I will assess endothelial cell mtROS production, mtROS-mediated suppression of EDD, and systemic and/or vascular endothelial cell markers of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inflammation. I will also determine the role of changes in pro- and anti-oxidant proteins with loss of function cell culture studies (Aim 2)."
"9370390","PROJECT SUMMARY  In gout, acute arthritis flares are often severe, and impair quality of life. Acute gout flares increase early, and  persist for years, in the titration and first years of maintenance of otherwise successful urate-lowering therapy  (ULT). Yet symptomatic gout manifests variably in established gout. Furthermore, gout does not uniformly  develop in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, despite detectable tissue urate crystal deposits in ~25%. Serum urate  (sUA) level helps guide clinical decision-making, eg, ULT to specific sUA target, or to identify ULT efficacy  (monitoring biomarker). sUA fulfills criteria for gout surrogate biomarker, as a surrogate end point in clinical  trials. However, sUA has no clear role in assessing the inflammatory state in gout. As such, there is major  unmet need for better biomarkers not only for incident gout in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, but also for which  gout patients will develop more frequent and severe flares, and thereby, to advance gout precision medicine  (CORT theme), by predicting need and duration, and monitor effectiveness of potentially toxic gout flare  colchicine or NSAID prophylaxis, particularly after starting and maintaining ULT. Our scientific premise directly  addresses these needs, building on our recent discovery that the metabolic energy biosensor AMP activated  Kinase (AMPK) controls on and off switches for model gouty inflammation. Remarkably, AMPK also is a  primary transducer of therapeutic effects of colchicine and methotrexate. Moreover, we present striking  Preliminary Studies for attenuated PBL AMPK activity in gout compared to healthy controls. Here, we will  translate basic findings that constitutive AMPK activity markedly limits the inflammatory potential of urate  crystals in vivo, partly by blunting activation of the inflammation master regulator NF-?B, and by limiting urate  crystal NLRP3 inflammasome activation/IL-1? release by macrophages. Significantly, AMPK activity both  regulates and reflects nutrition, carbohydrate metabolism, and inflammatory stressors, with tissue AMPK  activity known to be diminished in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Significantly, low AMPK  activity promotes common gout comorbid conditions (CORT theme), ie, hypertension, CKD onset, progression  and associated renal fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and nonalcoholic steatohepatosis. To test the hypothesis  that low AMPK activity predicts more frequent and severe inflammatory gouty arthritis flares, we will assay PBL  AMPK activity, and specific AMPK-targeted metabolites (assessed by metabolomics) in gout, healthy controls,  and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. We will perform an ancillary study of gout subjects in the VA CSP594  comparative effectiveness study of titrated allopurinol vs. febuxostat ULT, titrated to urate target, but with flares  at 72 weeks as the primary endpoint. We also will test the hypothesis that, in gout, low PBL AMPK activity is a  marker for patients with greater than the median inflammatory flares/year, and for increased NF-?B activity.  Project completion will translate metabolic regulation of inflammation to a novel biomarker and target for  preventing acute gout flares."

"9353657","Project Summary  Growing up in a stressful family environment - marked by conflict, insensitive parenting, chaos, dysfunction and a lack of warmth - increases risk for medical problems across the lifespan. The strongest evidence for these risks is in the realm of cardiovascular disease (CVD), although early-life family stress also heightens vulnerability to other chronic illnesses, including diabetes and cancer. Collectively, these chronic conditions affect half of the adult population in the US, and as such constitute a major public health burden. Presently there is limited mechanistic understanding of how these risks arise, but insights about underlying pathways could facilitate risk stratification and preventive efforts. In that regard, adolescence is a particularly important period to consider, given that the adolescent years are marked by significant changes in psychosocial and biobehavioral processes important to health. Adolescence is also when preclinical signs of chronic diseases emerge. However, there is a paucity of research focusing on how the family context during adolescence confers early disease risk, especially within prospective designs. As such, we know little about underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, whether these processes occur similarly across ethnic groups is unknown, despite evidence of significant cultural differences in health risks, family values, and psychosocial processes.  To address these issues, the proposed research of this application aims to: 1) examine the prospective relations between adolescent family experiences and a multi-layer inflammatory phenotype and metabolic endpoints during adolescence and adulthood; 2) determine whether these associations are mediated by poor social relationships, greater threat vigilance, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity; and 3) investigate the potential moderating role of ethnicity in these processes. These questions will be addressed using two separate longitudinal studies of adolescence. This program of research will advance our understanding of how the adolescent family context mechanistically impacts health across ethnic groups, which can inform the development of culturally tailored prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing risk for adverse health outcomes. In addition to addressing a public health concern, execution of the proposed studies will foster the applicant's development as a researcher investigating the interplay between the family and cultural contexts and psychosocial and behavioral processes during adolescence and their contributions to early disease risk. More specifically, it will support the applicant's training goals of deepening her understanding of how early stress confers early risk for poor long-term health via the immune system, acquiring laboratory skills for measuring basic immunologic processes, developing and applying quantitative skills in longitudinal and path analysis of epidemiological data, and establishing a publication record in these areas."
"9374699","REDS ABSTRACT In response to the large numbers of senior center clients who suffer from untreated depression, we have partnered with the NYC Department for the Aging (DFTA) to develop SMART-MH, a community care model that can be embedded in senior centers to improve recognition, referral, and adherence to depression treatment.

With our senior center partners and our mobile technology team, we redesigned Engage-M so that it can be used in a group format by licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs) of Senior Centers. Mobile technology provides probes for client adherence and offers to therapists easy to review summary records of mood, activity, and social interaction that can be used to target their sessions. We have integrated SMART-MH and Engage-M into a comprehensive community care model ?Reaching and Engaging Depressed Senior Center Clients? (REDS). The specific aims of this developmental project are to: 1. Finalize the REDS protocol and assess feasibility of training; 2. Prepare an Operations' Manual; 3. Examine reach, feasibility, and acceptability of REDS; 4. Examine engagement of behavioral targets and preliminary effectiveness; and 5) Collect information on REDS cost, barriers to implementation, and potential savings in health care utilization. We will randomly assign four senior centers to offer either Engage-M (N=40), the treatment offered by REDS (1 individual and 8 weekly group sessions) or 8 group sessions ?Wellness in Mind and Body? plus mental health referral (W-MH; N=20). The participants will have clinically significant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9>10) and will be older and middle-aged adults (55+); 12.6% of the NYC senior center clients are aged 55-65 years. Clients will be identified by senior center staff trained in SMART-MH strategies. We will offer additional training to staff of all centers on SMART-MH outreach, depression screening, and treatment engagement. We will train and provide weekly supervision to 2 or more LCSWs per center of the two centers assigned to Engage-M. We will not offer training or supervision to senior center staff leading the groups of W-MH but we will provide oversight so that clients receive mental health referrals and are encouraged to attend weekly Wellness group meetings. Our findings will set be used in a R01 study to formally test the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, non- billable costs, and barriers of REDS beyond NYC. If proven effective, with administrative support, REDS can be extended nationally and supported by billable services."
"9444171","Abstract (30 lines) As we seek to unlock how the brain generates behavior, measuring what the brain is doing as we observe the behaviors it generates, and building models that might mimic the process are critical. As tools for imaging and recording brain activity and behavior improve, and the complexity of our models and computations increase, so does the density and diversity of our measured datasets. Handling these much data is an intellectual challenge in itself, while arguably even more data will be needed if we are to understand the relation between brain and behavior. The projects within the U19 span a wide range of different approaches to dissect the motor pathway in the awake, behaving mouse. The methodologies to be used, supported by our Advanced Imaging and Instrumentation core, are almost uniformly prototype systems, not available off the shelf, and therefore will provide both unprecedented data, and present new challenges for standardization, analysis and information extraction. To support these activities, our data science resource core will draw upon the expertise of an exceptional interdisciplinary team with expertise in computer infrastructure, analysis and modeling, data science, statistics, machine learning and the teaching and training of data science methods. With this team, we hope to build a model data pipeline that is scalable, robust and capable of addressing immediate needs and deficiencies, while establishing best practices moving forward. The location of the U19 project within Columbia's new Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior institute will further enhance the impact of this effort, firstly through our ability to establish shard, state of the art infrastructure optimized for our framework and pipeline, and second by enabling us to establish new standards that can be scaled to serve the whole institute and beyond.  Our core will have 3 main components: 1) Establishing the hardware and network infrastructure that will enable centralized, indexed, secure yet easily shared data storage and high-power analysis from anywhere. This infrastructure will also include direct access to analyze host data on our high performance cluster resources and through cloud computing. 2) Developing, tracking, modularizing and sharing novel algorithms and modeling approaches centrally, enabling version control as well as indexing, pooling and sharing of processed data. 3) Establishing a core effort focusing on training and day to day support of researchers needing to establish skills and expertise in big data analysis, modeling and statistical methods. This latter effort recognizes that data analysis becomes a bottleneck when users lack programming skills, and analytical experience or simply confidence in their ability to develop their own experimental designs and analyze their own data. We plan to share and disseminate all aspects of our core activities, from best practices and hardware configurations, raw and processed data, algorithms and models and our new pedagogical approaches and successes."
"9444308","Project 4: Neural Basis of Behavioral Sequence Loops Abstract The goal of Project 4 is to understand how discrete action motifs are organized into goal-directed behavioral sequences that evolve over timescales of seconds to minutes. Behavioral sequence loops are at the highest level of our control-loop hierarchy, where they integrate high-level sensory representations and provide descending signals to guidance and motor loops. The execution of a behavioral sequence requires the ability to sustain activity (persistence), as well as the ability to switch between behaviors (fluidity). To investigate neural mechanisms of persistence and fluidity, we will study the circuits in the fly brain that control sequential behaviors such as visually guided walking, spatial navigation, and working memory. We will combine cell-type specific genetic driver lines with in vivo 2-photon imaging and electrophysiology to understand how these circuits balance competing demands to select and drive sequential behaviors. We will then use optogenetic tools to test specific circuit models of behavioral sequence generation in freely behaving flies. These studies are divided into the following three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Defining the cellular basis of stochastic control of walking. Specific Aim 2: Identify the neural circuitry underlying path integration. Specific Aim 3: Investigate the network mechanisms of counter-turning behavior."
"9456827","Although stroke is a discrete phenotype, it is the clinical culmination of several complex and interacting biological processes, precipitated by various genetic and environmental factors, thereby making ready analyses of its underlying mechanisms a challenge. However, the formulation of successful tailor-made prevention strategies for limiting the immense personal and societal burden of stroke in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is contingent on a better understanding of the predisposing risk factors for stroke in the region, which may not necessarily match the nature of stroke risk factors described among other people on other continents. Indeed, the underlying risk factors for stroke in SSA have hitherto not been comprehensively characterized, and currently there is a paucity of expertise, experience, and infrastructure in genomics and environmental research in SSA, to initiate and sustain such investigation. We seek to establish the Stroke Investigative Research and Education Network (SIREN) as a multidisciplinary collaborative research network of investigators in SSA and the United States collectively focused on exploring ways to promote a better understanding of the genetic and environmental risk factors for stroke among people of African ancestry. SIREN will evaluate unique contributors to stroke in SSA and compare these findings with those in a cohort of African American stroke survivors, all while simultaneously building sustainable capacities in phenomics, biobanking, genomics, biostatistics and bioinformatics for future high-level investigation of stroke and other vascular disease entities in SSA. SIREN is comprised of three interwoven Systematic Investigation of Blacks with Stroke (SIBS) projects geared at a comprehensive investigation of stroke: SIBS-Phenomics, SIBS-Genomics and SIBS-Bioinformatics. These projects will be implemented at eight sites in three countries (Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa), and will leverage prior experience and ongoing collaborations including previous participation in a global stroke epidemiological study, and involvement in two current NIH- funded studies based in SSA. Input from renowned content experts in United States, where the societal burden of stroke has been successfully reduced through proper identification of risk factors and implementation of corresponding preventive strategies will be obtained through systematic network activities.

"9562224","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technology to characterize microvascular network dynamics and assess its impact on tissue oxygen delivery is only now emerging. We have recently demonstrated the unprecedented ability to map oxygen in the microvasculature and cerebral tissue with two-photon microscopy (TPM) [Sakadzic2010] and are proposing to complement this with our novel statistical intensity variation optical coherence tomography (OCT), enabling quantitative dynamic maps of microvessel flow, red blood cell flux, and vessel diameter. Combined, these technologies will provide unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution imaging of oxygen delivery to brain tissue. These technologies will have a broad impact in health science in preclinical models of neuro-degenerative diseases and cancer, and, as we elaborate in Aim 4, help guide the identification of clinically relevant imaging biomarkers. To demonstrate the technologies' utility, we will address fundamental questions about cerebral vascular physiology: How do microvascular flow properties impact tissue oxygenation, and how do age-related vascular alterations compromise tissue oxygenation? We will then relate these findings to clinically relevant imaging biomarkers."

"9387266","Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this project is to develop a novel detector technology that can yield significant improvements in clinical time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF PET) scanners by improving the coincidence time resolution (CTR) of PET detector modules. The main benefit of improved CTR in TOF PET scanners is allowing time-of-flight information to be incorporated into the time-of-flight reconstruction, leading to a large improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Investigations performed over the last decade using both physical phantoms and clinical studies have shown that this improvement can be used to improve the imaging performance of PET, through a combination of improved lesion detectability, reduced scan time or injected dose, and more accurate and precise tumor uptake measurements. The clinical benefits of TOF PET have been clearly demonstrated, but the ultimate benefits of TOF PET have yet to be realized because the CTR of current commercial TOF PET scanners is still limited to about 400?500 ps fwhm. All commercial PET detector modules read out the scintillation light from only one end of the crystal (i.e., single-ended readout), which has two serious limitations when applied to practical system using long efficient crystals: 1) they do not measure depth-of-interaction (DOI) and cannot compensate for variations in annihilation and optical photon transit times; and 2) the spatial resolution is limited because they do not compensate for parallax error away from the center of the imaging field. The proposed detector technology using dual-ended readout overcomes both of these limitations by correcting for all depth-dependent effects and using a better statistical approach in estimating the arrival time. As a result, significant improvement can be achieved in the CTR and DOI resolution. The motivation for this project is based on our recent simulation studies that show that reading the scintillation light from both ends of the crystal (i.e., dual-ended readout) with high-performance silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) photodetectors will lead to detector modules with unprecedented CTR for TOF PET applications. We expect to achieve at least a factor of two improvement in the SNR, which corresponds to a factor of four improvement in the sensitivity. We will accomplish this through a combination of advanced fast scintillator materials, high-performance SiPM photodetectors, high-performance readout electronics, and an algorithm based on the inverse variance weighted average to give the best time resolution in an innovative dual-ended readout detector module. The outcome of this proposal will be high-performance TOF PET detector modules with a dramatic improvement in the time resolution, which is needed to justify the development of the next generation of clinical TOF PET scanners."

"9410415","PROJECT SUMMARY  After transcription, RNA molecules undergo a number of processing steps that regulate the spliced sequence, RNA expression level, subcellular localization, and initiation and rate of translation, and are each controlled by the activity of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). RNA processing plays critical roles in normal development, and altered RNA processing has been shown to cause familial Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and multiple cancer types. Identifying the RNA targets of the RBP mutated in these diseases is a critical first step towards a mechanistic understanding of the disease and, ultimately, development of targeted therapeutics. However, standardized methods for identification of RBP targets transcriptome-wide were lacking, as they required large sample input amounts, had high experimental failure rates, and required high amplification leading to significant wasted sequencing and non-quantitative results.  Recently we developed the enhanced CLIP-seq (eCLIP) methodology, which showed thousand-fold improved efficiency of generating high-throughput sequencing libraries from RBP profiling experiments and enabled highly robust and reproducible RBP target profiling through the incorporation of paired size-matched inputs. Here we will develop the eCLIP method for wide-spread use by the academic and commercial biotechnology industry in the following aims:  1. Develop an eCLIP kit, and perform optimization and stability testing to ensure robust data  generation from a standardized kit format.  2. Perform alpha testing of a standardized eCLIP kit and protocol to validate experimental success  and identify areas for further optimization.  3. Develop and validate standard conditions for various cell-types, tissues, and sample types  (including flash-frozen versus fixed tissues, small sample amounts, and non-human samples).  4. Develop software tools for standard data processing and primary data analysis of eCLIP data,  including integration with publicly available eCLIP data resources.  Eclipse Bio is an ideal candidate to perform the aims described above due to our expertise in genomics and computational biology (particularly in the area of RNA processing), as well as in the starting of early-phase biology companies, make us ideal candidates to perform the research proposed above. The four aims above will take eCLIP from an academic research method to one that can be standardly performed by biomedical researchers in academia as well as commercial entities, without requiring extensive expertise in RNA biology. The development of standardized commercial kits to profile DNA binding protein targets by ChIP-seq rapidly led to large-scale adoption of this technique, and has provided significant benefits to studies of DNA binding proteins involved in various diseases; development of an eCLIP kit will similarly enable studies of RNA binding proteins. Additionally, our location in San Diego proximal to numerous academic research institutes (including UCSD and the Salk Institute) as well as biotechnology companies will provide scientific and commercialization expertise and assistance.

"9438115","Abstract Cancer ranks as the second leading cause of death, contributing to nearly 1 in every 4 death in the US. Current cancer immunotherapies, especially checkpoint blockade, is largely influenced by PD-L1 expression in tumors; and patients with limited PD-L1 positive expression are normally less responsive to the immunotherapy. These findings suggest new technologies are needed to for PD-L1 resistant tumors. Cyclic [G(3',5')pA(3',5')p] (cGAMP) has recently emerged as an exciting new class of vaccine adjuvants, which sequentially activate innate immune responses and orchestrate adaptive immunity. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), a major type of immune cells in tumor microenvironment, are a potent target for adjuvant therapy. Particulate systems are ideal vehicles for targeting TAM population within tumor. Additionally, combination therapy holds great promise for tumor prevention and treatment. Most important, the critical role of cancer microbiome is gaining increased interests for cancer therapy. We hypothesize that Particulate cGAMP adjuvants targeting TAMs can enhance anti-tumor immune response and reverse the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment in both PD-L1 responsive and resistant cancers, and improve the anti-tumor efficiency in combination with checkpoint blockade and tumor resection. We have tested and will continue to test the hypothesis using B16F10 melanoma (subcutaneous and lung metastasis models; PD-L1 responsive) and C3(1)Tag basal-like breast cancer (orthotopic and spontaneous GEM models; PD-L1 resistant), and test the following specific aims: Aim 1. Particulate delivery of STING agonist as anti-cancer immuotherapeutics: (F99 phase). We optimized liposomal NP and Ace-DEX MP delivery systems for cGAMP to evaluate the cellular uptake and M2->M1 skewing capacity, and detect major histocompatibility (MHC) gene and costimulatory gene expression and cytokine production in vitro. We also investigated the tissue distribution of particulate cGAMPs and their anti-tumor efficacy in above-mentioned tumor models. Aim 2. Mechanism by which particulate delivery of STING agonist acts an as anti-cancer immuotherapeutic and combination therapies: (F99 phase). We will study the role of macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and NK cells in anti-tumor response of particulate cGAMPs. We will also monitor long term survival and tumor recurrence by combination therapies of particulate cGAMPs with anti-PD-L1 antibodies and tumor resection in above- mentioned tumor models. Aim 3.

"9351526","Project 6: Mothes/Blanchard Conformational trajectories of inhibitor-bound HIV-1 envelope Summary The design of effective antiviral therapies directed against HIV Env pursued by this program requires a fast method to determine the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV Env inhibition by small molecule inhibitors. Towards this end, we have established single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) methods to visualize directly the structural dynamics of HIV Env in the context of the complete trimer on the surface of HIV virions. As a proof of concept we have successfully applied smFRET to the X4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3- Our work reveals that the unliganded HIV Env is conformationally dynamic and intrinsically capable of sampling receptor CD4- and 17b-stabilized conformations. Importantly, the co-receptor binding site is more likely to be accessed from the CD4-induced state. Binding of CD4 lowers the energy of the CD4-stabilized conformation and prepares the HIV Env for co-receptor binding. These data explain how HIV Env is activated in a stepwise manner by CD4 and the co-receptor. Here, we will extend the application of smFRET to include physiologically relevant R5-tropic HIV-1 Env isolates. Dually modified HIV-1 Env variants will be used to determine the conformational trajectories of HIV Env induced by CD4 mimetics and antagonists. This will allow distinction between CD4 mimics such as NBD556 that induce CD4-like conformational changes and antagonists such as DMJ-l-228. smFRET imaging will also permit an understanding of conformational molecular events underlying HlV-1 inactivation either by prematurely activating Env, kinetic traps or allosterically diverting Env into off-pathways. As such, these smFRET technologies will provide a critical tool to determine the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV Env antagonism and inactivation developed by the Program Project Team and aid in a rational design of antiviral therapies that exploit the intrinsic vulnerabilities of HIV. smFRET technologies will accelerate pharmaceutical discovery by enabling screening for desired conformational effects that block, trap or inactivate HIV-1 Env."

"9470731","PROJECT SUMMARY Treating individuals with schizophrenia requires a broad array of services, including physical health care services, which are primarily financed by Medicaid. Despite high health care costs, most patients do not receive recommended care, and minorities are less likely to do so than whites. Moreover, where patients live matters, with quality and quality disparities varying not just among states but also among counties within states. At a time of reform and fiscal constraint, Medicaid programs are challenged with improving quality and reducing quality disparities among high-needs beneficiaries, including those with schizophrenia, at no extra costs. Factors likely to impact a program?s success include its ability to 1) comprehensively measure quality of care, capturing key domains of both mental health and physical health care, 2) validly and feasibly measure the value of care routinely delivered to their beneficiaries, and importantly, 3) incorporate racial/ethnic disparities in the assessment of value. Such measurement efforts should be undertaken at the level of meaningful geographic units such as counties, where patterns of health care are influenced by policies reflecting both state and local priorities. In response to FOA 16-221, we propose a program of research that seeks to reduce health disparities and improve the health of minority populations served in publicly funded settings through measurement of quality disparities and other critical domains of Medicaid-financed care delivered to adults with schizophrenia living in five diverse states. We will measure quality using evidence- based indicators, and exploiting psychometric principles, we will create an overall composite score as well as key sub-scores. Using the composite measure, we will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in overall quality of care; value, defined as the cost to the Medicaid state program of producing high-quality care; and the cost to the program of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in quality. We will integrate quality and costs through a unique cost-effectiveness methodology, and to our knowledge, our work will be the first to quantitatively link disparities and costs of serious mental illness care. Our ultimate goal is to provide policymakers with a user-friendly interactive tool to monitor quality, quality disparities, costs, and value, thus enabling evidence-based policymaking. Aim 1 will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in quality of mental health, physical health, and overall health care routinely delivered to beneficiaries with schizophrenia. Aim 2 will develop and implement a cost-effectiveness framework to assess value, operationalized as the incremental net monetary benefit of care. Aim 3 will use the statewide white population as a reference standard to determine the cost of eliminating racial/ethnic quality disparities in each county. Aim 4 will develop and pilot a user-friendly interactive tool to enable state Medicaid programs to monitor quality, disparities, costs, and value of care. We expect that the proposed research will contribute to the eradication of disparities through advanced performance measurement techniques that will enable routine monitoring of Medicaid care."

"9437909","Project Summary/Abstract Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) is the primary enzyme critical for maintaining telomere length, but is normally silenced in somatic cells to limit the amount of times a cell can replicate. In order for somatic cells to become tumorigenic, they must re-activate the telomerase complex by re-enabling TERT expression. The most common way that many cancers re-activate telomerase is by acquiring an activating mutation in the promoter region of the TERT gene. These TERT promoter mutations occur in over 50 types of cancer, including over 80% of primary glioblastomas (GBM), and place TERT expression under the control of the GABP transcription factor complex in tumors that bear them. I have previously discovered that a specific GABP transcription factor complex, the GABPB1L-containing GABP tetramer, is recruited to the mutant TERT promoter and is required for telomerase reactivation in GBM. I found that disruption of this GABP tetramer complex via CRISPR/Cas9 editing was sufficient to reverse cellular immortality exclusively in GBM lines bearing TERT promoter mutations. Strikingly, the TERT promoter wild-type lines lacking GABPB1L displayed no phenotype, suggesting that this GABP tetramer complex is dispensable for normal cell function. Furthermore, further analysis revealed that TERT promoter mutant lines lacking GABPB1L were dying from the high- level genomic instability, a previously described mechanism of cell death with tangible therapeutic implications. These initial findings have raised two main questions the F99 research will address: (1) Why is the GABPB1L- containing GABP tetramer dispensable for normal cell function, but GABPB1L deficiency is lethal to TERT promoter mutant cancers? Understanding the specificity of GABPB1L for the mutant TERT promoter is key for assessing its candidacy as a new therapeutic target in TERT promoter mutant GBM. Answering this question will require the use of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, skills employed by the Costello lab. (2) Can we combine standard therapies for GBM with the ablation of GABPB1L to achieve synergistic anti-tumor effects? Genomic instability induced by TERT depletion sensitizes cancer cells to DNA damaging agents. Thus, I propose to evaluate the potential for synergy between GABPB1L inhibition, subsequent TERT depletion and current GBM therapies in TERT promoter-mutant GBM. I expect that my efforts will provide insight into this potential therapy targeting GBM immortality while also providing me with training critical to my career as a researcher in cancer cell immortality. For the K00 phase, I propose to leverage the broad range of conceptual and technical expertise I have amassed studying TERT promoter mutations on a mechanistic level in GBM to complete a postdoctoral fellowship studying cellular immortality as a therapeutic target in cancer. Although I hope to continue to study TERT promoter mutations, I plan to expand my knowledge base by studying other mechanisms of cancer immortality in GBM and cancer types such as lung or colon cancer. Specifically, I will combine my previous research experience with advanced training in in vivo models of cancer, bioinformatics, cancer therapeutics, and molecular biology to provide new insight into the mechanisms governing cancer cell immortality and to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms."
"9329489","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the role of thalamocortical networks in the production of cognitive control behaviors, and specifically, to understand how this network is perturbed in schizophrenia, a psychiatric illness affecting about 1% of the population, to produce cognitive control deficits in the disease. Both the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) have been implicated to play a role in cognitive control tasks that involve working memory and context processing, areas that are functionally disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. These experiments will investigate how the thalamocortical network linking the MD to the dorsolateral PFC operates to implement cognitive control by relating neural dynamics in this network to the selection of one out of several alternative responses to the same stimulus. The approach will combine large-scale neural recording, pharmacological manipulation of synaptic function, and computational modeling of synaptic interactions to investigate how communication between neurons in the thalamus and the PFC allows prefrontal networks to switch between alternative responses to the same stimulus. We will then manipulate synaptic function with an NMDA receptor antagonist, which induces the specific pattern of errors in cognitive control as is seen in patients with schizophrenia. This will allow us to relate changes in physiological dynamics of local PFC and MD-PFC network to the observed deficit in behavioral performance. We will achieve the following two objectives: (1) provide one of the best available functional dissections of the role of thalamocortical prefrontal networks in information processing, and (2) reveal how disruption of the function of these networks could lead to cognitive deficits that typify human neuropsychiatric disease. Additionally, the temporal and spatial resolution of the single cell recordings in the proposed experiments allow for the potential to complement data from imaging studies by revealing how information processing is disrupted at a cellular level in schizophrenia. Eventually, this work will pave the way for the development and testing of new therapeutics such as new drugs, neuromodulation interventions, and gene therapies."

Further, obesity and T2D are complex disorders influenced by genetics and environmental factors, and their interactions across the life-course. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that genetic variants were associated with higher risk of obesity and T2D. Individuals carrying some risk genes exhibit a markedly increased preference for high fat, but a significantly reduced preference for high sucrose food. However, the genetic evidence is mainly restricted to those of European descent and some Asian ethnic groups. There is a significant gap in our knowledge of genetic risks for Native Hawaiians and minority populations. And, the mechanisms underlying genetic predisposition to obesity and T2D and how lifestyle characteristics interact with genes remain obscure for Native Hawaiians, as well as other high-risk groups. Therefore, this proposed two-year study of secondary data from the Multiethnic cohort study of Diet and Cancer (MEC) aims to identify genetically predisposed risk groups and modifiable behavioral risk factors among Native Hawaiians and other minority ethnic groups living in Hawaii and California. We will first perform GWAS studies to identify genetic risk variants that are associated with obesity and T2D. Utilizing the identified risk genes, we will generate genetic ?barcode? and cluster subjects into various personalized genetic ?barcode? patterns. Then the genetic ?barcode? patterns and neighborhood socio-economic status will be incorporated into mixed models as cross-classified random effects to examine how our genetic patterns interact with diet and physical activities, individual socioeconomic status for all MEC racial/ethnic groups. The proposed study will provide a molecular basis for generating clinically useful classifications of obesity and T2D and will therefore contribute to identify new targets for pharmaceutical or behavioral interventions. It may lead to improved understanding of the role of epigenetics, such as DNA methylation, as a mediator of life-course gene-environmental interactions. Building upon this R21 funding, our long-term goal is to obtain R01 funding to support the collection of methylation data and perform epigenome- wide methylation studies (EWAS) of obesity and T2D. Combined results from GWAS and EWAS studies will significantly improve our understanding of the disease pathophysiology with implications for better-tailored public health interventions."
"9450149","Project Summary/Abstract   Substance use problems and HIV/AIDS disease are complex disorders that affect the health of disadvantaged  racial/ethnic minority groups, largely due to significant health disparities. To make significant progress in identifying the  underlying causes of these diseases and improve their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment requires the work of a  transdisciplinary team of researchers united by a common mission, supported by a connected infrastructure, and working  in a geographical location ideally suited for the study of the targeted diseases and disparities. The proposed RCMI, will  bolster critical infrastructure, technologies, collaborations, recruitment of new minority faculty, and professional  development of minority faculty already at Florida International University (FIU), to meet the challenges of improving the  health of traditionally underrepresented groups and reduce health disparities. FIU is among the 10 largest universities in  the US with a diverse student body of nearly 50,000 students, including 61% Hispanic, 15% non-Hispanic white, 13%  non-Hispanic black, 4% Asian, and 7% other minority groups. There are 256 early stage minority faculty in various  disciplines related to health disparities in HIV or substance use problems. FIU has demonstrated an extraordinary support  for developing the next generation of health disparity researchers with institutional support to diversify faculty and  promote equity at FIU. The activities of this proposed RCMI will provide research opportunities, mentoring from  numerous senior, NIH-funded investigators, infrastructure that includes laboratories, clinical spaces, and behavioral  studies, imaging studies, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics support. Educational opportunities will include seminars,  colloquia, journal club, lectures, mini-courses and mentorship committees. Training in responsible conduct of research is  mandatory for all senior and junior investigators. The RCMI and FIU?s Office of Research and Economic Development  (ORED) will assure inclusion and integration of infrastructure, prioritize resources to make facilities available, provide  assistance to meet requirements for institutional compliance, support operation, administration and research activities and  devise plans for sustaining research infrastructure through cost recovery. The training provided by this RCMI will  enhance the diversity of the research enterprise and will offer mentoring opportunities on community engagement,  recruitment of minority populations, and addressing the mechanisms by which health disparities and differences in health  outcomes negatively affect racial and ethnic minorities."
"9436134","Better biomarkers are needed for the diagnosis, categorization, monitoring and prognostication of SLE and lupus nephritis. In this respect, saliva constitutes one of the most readily obtainable body fluids, associated with the least complications, compared to blood draws. Using this body fluid is particularly attractive in the pediatric lupus population and in patients from whom blood is difficult to obtain. Our preliminary studies reveal that saliva from SLE patients is ANA-positive and harbors several proteins that are currently being pursued as potential serum biomarkers of SLE and lupus nephritis. Encouraged by these findings, the proposed pilot study will investigate the different isotypes and specificities of autoantibodies and biomarker candidate proteins that are elevated in the saliva of SLE and lupus nephritis patients, and establish their association with disease activity. Both targeted analyses of selected autoantibodies and proteins, as well as array-based screens of novel autoantibodies or proteins will be executed. These studies may not only lead to the identification of novel biomarkers in lupus, they may also pave the way to home-based salivary diagnostics in the near future."
"9503496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer research has consistently shown evidence of racial/ethnic disparities across the cancer  continuum from detection/screening and treatment-related outcomes to mortality; and socioeconomic status  (SES) has been suggested as a substantial factor in the racial differences; yet, the research results for SES  disparities i prostate cancer-related outcomes as well as SES as an explanatory factor in racial/ethnic  disparities in prostate cancer have been inconsistent. Some have suggested that this inconsistency may be due to imprecise (and inconsistent or incomplete) measurement of socioeconomic circumstances.   Thus, there have been calls in the cancer disparities literature for greater clarity on the pathways and mechanisms causing differential cancer outcomes across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the conceptualization AND operationalization of socioeconomic circumstances in this literature.  An expanded view of the socioeconomic context for prostate cancer patients might uncover socioeconomic factors influencing disparities in treatment-related outcomes over and above the traditional SES measures; and a construct to capture this expanded socioeconomic context is financial well-being (FWB).  The  specific aims of the research project are to:  1) Develop and refine a conceptual model of the multidimensional  construct FWB using structured interviews with prostate cancer patients and a focus group with clinical social  workers; 2) Develop and pilot test a measure of FWB; 3) Evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure  of FWB and investigate the association between components of FWB, socio-demographic characteristics, and  treatment selection and adherence and perceived quality of treatment; and 4) Investigate differences in  responses to FWB items across racial/ethnic groups and evaluate potential measurement bias across  racial/ethnic groups. The successful completion of the research project will result in a valid measurement and causal model of FWB that articulates how the dimensions of FWB are related to prostate cancer treatment-related outcomes.  The candidate, Dr. Reginald Tucker-Seeley, is a Research Associate in the Center for Community Based Research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The proposed five year NCI Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) will provide the necessary mentoring, training, and research experiences in cancer care/health services, psycho-oncology, and measures/scale development to implement the proposed research project.  His long term career goal is to become an independent investigator developing projects to reduce socioeconomic disparities across the cancer continuum from prevention to end-of-life care.   Through this work, he plans to identify the socioeconomic pathways contributing to cancer disparities and to design innovate interventions that help individuals better manage and leverage their socioeconomic and psychosocial resources for improved health."
"9433047","PROJECT SUMMARY While metabolomics is playing an increasing role in clinical and translational research, the field suffers from 1) lack of computational tools for identifying metabolites in large-scale experiments; 2) difficulty in defining biological factors that affect metabolic phenotypes; 3) transparency and availability of computational methods and tools that facilitate discovery of disease-related metabolites. To this end, the goal of this proposal is to integrate metabolite and gene pathway annotations for integrative pathway analysis, thereby facilitating and improving biological interpretation of disease-related metabolic phenotypes. The rationale for integrating biological pathways of metabolites and genes is that it expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie disease-specific metabolite profiles. Such deeper understanding may accelerate finding novel therapeutic targets, and guide identification of clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Toward these goals, I propose a collaborative approach to 1) construct and depoy RaMP, Relational database of Metabolomics Pathways, that includes gene and metabolite annotations, and 2) develop and implement pathway enrichment methods for improved pathway enrichment analysis of disease-specific metabolites/genes. Importantly RaMP and associated analysis tools will be developed in support of the open science and reproducibility paradigms, where developments (source code, database structure) will be open to the public. It is our hope that RaMP would drive further cross-talks between the fields of genomics and metabolomics, which are critical in our search for improved disease biomarkers and therapeutic options. Completion of this proposal will yield an integrated database of gene and metabolite biological pathways, including tools that perform key aspects of pathway enrichment analysis. To help ensure these tools are adopted by the metabolomics community and yield reproducible results, RaMP will be accessible as 1) a standalone database easily integrable with other tools, and 2) a web application accessing RaMP for complex queries and pathway enrichment analysis. Meeting these goals could help elucidate molecular functions that underlie disease-related metabolites, and could unravel novel gene targets that modulate these molecular functions toward a non-disease state."
"9479907","Overall Abstract The Center for Solutions for ME/CFS (CfS for ME/CFS) is an inter-disciplinary, inter-institutional center comprised of clinicians, clinical investigators, basic scientists who are committing to working together to understand the pathogenesis of ME/CFS and develop evidence-based strategies for interventions that prevent and mitigate disease. The team initially coalesced with an NIH call to respond to spurious reports linking xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) to ME/CFS. It consolidated its vision with support from the Hutchins Family Foundation Chronic Fatigue Initiative (CFI) and a crowd-funding organization, The Microbe Discovery Project, to explore the role of infection and immunity in disease and identify biomarkers for diagnosis through functional genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic discovery. The foundation for this project is a large clinical database and sample repository representing oral, fecal, and blood samples from well-characterized ME/CFS subjects and frequency-matched controls collected nationwide over a period of several years. In Project 1, we survey for the presence of molecular footprints of bacterial, fungal, and viral agents and corresponding immune responses in a 100 case/100 control subset of repository samples using high throughput sequencing, high density peptide arrays, and immune signature assays; this Project also examines the prevalence of autoantibodies selected based on clinical and literature reports. In Project 2, we profile the plasma metabolome and PBMC transcriptome in the same subjects studied in Project 1 using state-of-the-art mass spectrometric and RNA-seq methods, comprehensive mass spectral libraries, and tools for RNA profiling in bulk cell populations using cell sub-type specific markers. We also pursue metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses after orthostatic and exercise challenges using samples collected in Project 3. In Project 3, we mine existing databases at Columbia and the CFI for insights into clinical features, comorbidities, and sub-types that can be used to refine laboratory analyses, as well as enhance patient care. We will work with clinicians and the ME/CFS community to design a mobile app that will allow patients and caregivers to track clinical status in response to stressors and interventions, and will provide prospective research data. We will also investigate the utility of the Lean Test as a simple outpatient test for autonomic function."
"9483499","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core (CEDC) will create an information and dissemination infrastructure in collaboration with the Administrative and Investigator Development Cores to improve how evidence-based science is collaboratively disseminated while utilizing approaches that are aligned and culturally-centered within community contexts. The CEDC will use community engaged research approaches, including community-based participatory research (CBPR) in partnering with communities to advance and create a bidirectional translational approach called Community Centered Dissemination Science. CCDS is an innovative approach to ensure knowledge creation and dissemination, facilitated through a Community of Practice for Dissemination (COP4D), a highly active university and community/tribal stakeholder partnership. The CEDC and COP4D will collaboratively guide the TREE Center?s dissemination strategies to ensure alignment with community/tribal preference for exchange of information on research objectives, lessons learned, preliminary data, and overall findings to translate and disseminate transdisciplinary, multilevel science. By bringing together diverse expertise in multilevel intervention research, we will be able to advance implementation and dissemination science to reduce health inequities and behavioral health disparities. The co-creation process of community-centered dissemination sciences aims to identify and integrate ?scientific? aspects of traditional knowledge and traditional aspects of ?scientific knowledge? to bring together the complementary strengths of community and academic expertise. The CEDC will work with both academic and community/tribal behavior health stakeholders to implement timely and appropriate dissemination information that emerges from the Center?s research and pilot projects. We seek to have major impact on behavioral health disparities in New Mexico?s diverse population (with a focus primarily on American Indian, Hispanic/Latino and rural/frontier communities), and the many social, political, and economic antecedents which are salient in these populations. The CEDC?s three major aims will offer a framework to promote Community-Centered Dissemination Science as part of its overall innovation to help academic investigators and communities identify and translate differences between their two knowledge systems to ensure co-knowledge creation and co- dissemination."
"9552403","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Childhood Liver Disease Research and Education Network (ChiLDREN) provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of children with serious liver diseases. Continued productive contributions of this Clinical Center to ChiLDREN are proposed with 3 major aims: I. Consortium Contribution: A well-organized infrastructure that enables a high level of patient enrollment and data and specimen collection is well established, integrated into one of the largest pediatric hepatology programs in the United States with experienced investigators and coordinators, and an excellent track record in clinical research. In addition, we propose leading an analysis of clinical data and biliary atresia liver tissue to better evaluate phenotypic and clinicopathological correlations and, by competing outcomes, multivariate and neural network modeling, to better predict and determine outcomes after hepatoportenterostomy. II. Ancillary Studies: Several unique studies are linked to this proposal, developing from this Clinical  Center's pre-eminent strengths and preliminary studies: (i) serum fibrosis and novel imaging markers  will be further evaluated to improve diagnosis and monitor liver fibrosis in ChiLDREN diseases; (ii) in  parallel mechanistic studies, we are further exploring the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of  biliary atresia and CFLD, studying epigenetic, genetic, and fundamental fibrogenetic mechanisms in  liver tissue and serum, and we propose extending these studies to repository tissue and data analysis. III. Clinical Trial: To evaluate new antifibrogenic therapies, a Phase II clinical trial of pentoxyfilline (PTX), a known antifibrogenic antiinflammatory agent of proven safety in infants, is being conducted in infants with newly-diagnosed BA (registered with clinical trials.gov) to determine whether PTX has sufficient biological activity against BA, with minimal risk, which warrants further study. We hypothesize that PTX will be a safe and effective therapeutic agent to improve outcomes for select children with progressive biliary fibrosis/cirrhosis. Since there are currently no effective medical therapies for CHiLDREN diseases, proper exploration of the safety and efficacy of this agent would perfectly fit within the charge of ChiLDREN, which is uniquely poised to examine such novel therapies on a large scale. We hope to renew our productive contribution to achieving all the aims of ChiLDREN, helping to make a difference for children with liver diseases. We expect to provide high-value participation, capitalize on the well- developed ChiLDREN serum and tissue repository in the search for non-invasive biomarkers and better prediction of outcomes, embark upon fruitful mechanistic studies on the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases, and help lead investigations of novel safe therapies to help fill the current therapeutic void."
"9458852","This is a competitive renewal in support of the Discovery to Cure High School Internship Program (DTCHIP). The Discovery to Cure High School Internship was established 15 years ago in order to offer an unprecedented scientific and personal challenge to young students by pairing them with respected scientists and encouraging and fostering their interest in the fields of science and medicine. The Program has been extremely successful. Its impact on young scientists has been proven over the years, and with the support of NICHD/NIH, we have been able to expand the program and increase the number of participating students. During the current funding period (2012-2016), the DTCHIP has mentored 208 Scholars, 138 from minority or underprivileged areas. The quality and relevance of the program are recognized by top universities, which take into consideration the students' participation in the program for their selection. Top colleges and universities throughout the country, including Yale University, have accepted the graduated high school Scholars from the program, with a record number in their early action. This proposal is a continuation of this well-established, rigorous, step-wise, research-training program. Our objective is to continue and expand our objective to provide, thought the Discovery to Cure High School Internship Program high-quality research experience to qualified students, undergraduates, and high school teachers and to expose them to the excitement and possibility of biomedical research careers. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1) To provide high school students with a rich intellectual and investigative environment. Interns work in state-of-the-art laboratories, under the mentorship of a PI, post-doctorate or research assistant, learning basic laboratory methods and techniques and producing an independent research project, which he or she presents to mentors, faculty, and peers at the end of the Program. Aim 2) To encourage scientific curiosity, cooperation and foster critical thinking. Interns develop their own scientific projects, which will be further expanded during the academic year at their institution, encouraging them to participate in National Science events. As proven so far, the DTCHIP provides the Scholars with the training required to contribute in an active, productive and significant way to the ongoing research within the laboratories that they are assigned. The data generated by the Scholars has been incorporated into publications where they are co-authors, further contributing to their academic careers."
"9396633","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  A number of mental disorders involve dysfunction in facial emotion recognition, that often entails biases in their interpretation (e.g., towards negative interpretations). Emotion recognition dysfunction has received considerable attention in psychological and neuroscientific research given its relation to social well-being and psychopathology in clinical groups and the general population. Emotional states are considered one route cause of these biases due to their involvement in mental disorders and tie to emotion perception in psychological theory. However, there is a poor understanding of whether emotions in fact bias perception (as opposed to judgment) of facial emotions, and the neural bases of associative and perceptual processes underlying this bias. The current proposal applies cutting-edge methods across social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience to address these outstanding questions. It is proposed that the orbitofrontal cortex provides top- down emotional predictions which bias perceptual facial emotion representations in the fusiform gyrus. This research has the potential to provide significant insights into the nature of emotion-perception interactions, with considerable implications for the study of their deficits in mental disorders. Specifically, the proposed studies apply advanced connectivity and multivariate voxel pattern analyses to fMRI data to explore the perceptual and neural basis of emotional biases in facial emotion perception, and a human lesion patient study to investigate the causal role of brain regions in this process. The experiments study the impact of sad and happy transient emotional states and moods on facial emotion perceptions. Overall, the proposal aims to (i) assess whether emotion perception biases occur at perceptual levels of processing, (ii) involve interaction of the OFC and FG perhaps through the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus (IFOF), and (iii) whether the OFC plays a causal role in providing top-down biases towards the emotion perceptions. The candidate has proposed a thorough training plan to acquire proficiency in the integration of theories and methods of social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience to answer the research questions at hand. The training plan at New York University (NYU) is ideal given the departmental resources for fMRI and lesion patient studies, access to lecture training experiences (colloquia, workshops, journal clubs, lab meetings), and advanced courses in related theory and methodology. Importantly, the proposal includes sponsors who are experts at the forefront of interdisciplinary studies into the neural bases of face perception (Dr. Freeman) and emotion (Dr. Phelps). Together, the mentorship team provide a promising opportunity for the candidate to obtain premier training in the proposed theoretical and methodological areas. The long-term goal of this training plan is to provide the candidate with training to complete the proposed research and pursue a tenure-track faculty position to continue advancing this research area."
"9354179","ABSTRACT  The Research Project serves as the principal research directive of the AACORT. The overall goal of  the AACORT is the comprehensive study of the pathology of Alopecia Areata, which the Research  Project formalizes into four key goals: 1) the study of the microbiome, 2) proteomic research into  AA autoantigens, 3) mouse model studies of AA pathology and drug discovery, 4) and studies of human  AA patients for molecular pathology and drug response. These four goals will result in the full  characterization of the microbiome, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic loads that contribute to  AA pathology. This, in turn, will provide the foundation for the development of biomarkers to track  AA progression and response to treatment (both genomic and molecular), and the identification of  drug targets and drug candidates. To drive the pursuit of these objectives, the Research Project  will serve as a key mediator between the TRAC Core, which will be responsible for designing and  acquiring human patient biosamples for analysis, and the DATA Core, which will oversee the  annotation, storage, and analysis of all data generated by the TRAC. It will be one of the Research  Project?s roles to identify targetable biological objectives to these two cores, which will then  acquire the data and analyze it for the key molecular drivers that the Research Project can then  validate as a complement to their ongoing research. Experiments pursued by the Research Project, in  human or mouse models, will be continuously cross-checked with the bioinformatic analyses of human  cohorts to develop an unprecedented systemic model of AA pathology. In this manner, all ongoing  research in the AACORT will be mediated by the central biological questions posed by the Research  Project, thereby providing uniform objectives for which the AACORT can leverage its multiple  analytic pipelines."
"9540471","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) was created in 2005 to evaluate the clinical course of perinatally acquired HIV infection among adolescents and pre-adolescents and the consequences of fetal and neonatal exposure to HIV and antiretroviral chemotherapy among a representative cohort of children in the United States. PHACS is comprised of a Scientific Leadership Group (SLG), which is overseen by a Coordinating Center, a Data and Operations Center (DOC), and 22 clinical units (CU). The Department of Epidemiology and the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research at the Harvard School of Public Health, Westat, and the Frontier Science Foundation form the PHACS DOC. The DOC collaborates with the SLG to define the PHACS research agenda; provides methodological leadership for the development of all PHACS analytic projects; maintains CU subcontracts and trains and monitors sites in proper procedures for PHACS research; plans and conducts all leadership and full PHACS network meetings; develops HIV- and health- related educational materials and opportunities for the PHACS community; and, supports an active Community Advisory Board. The Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP), a cohort of 450 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and preadolescents age 7-16 at enrollment, was established to investigate the impact of HIV and ART on organ systems, growth and development, sexual maturation, pubertal development, cognition, emotional development, and socialization; AMP Up was subsequently designed to extend follow-up of AMP participants and other HIV-infected young adults who have reached 18 years of age using a streamlined, mobile-friendly protocol. A drug toxicity surveillance system, Surveillance Monitoring for Anti-Retroviral Toxicities (SMART), has enrolled 3,506 perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected children to evaluate long-term effects of in-utero ART exposure. In PHACS III, the DOC will continue to carry out the PHACS scientific agenda in an increasing efficient manner, enrolling and following an additional 1,000 newborns into SMARTT and an additional 525 HIV-infected and HIV-exposed, uninfected young adults into AMP Up. Together, HSPH, Westat and Frontier Science bring a long and successful history of providing the scientific and operational leadership required by PHACS, as well as innovative methods to enhance and maximize the efficiency of the PHACS study design, conduct, and analyses. Given our prior experience we are uniquely positioned to continue to provide the scientific/epidemiologic and operational leadership essential to the continued success of PHACS."
"9379366","Thermal ablation of focal prostate cancer (PCa) with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has recently received FDA approval as a non-invasive alternative to first-line treatment options that are still associated with significant morbidity and adverse side effects. However, current clinical transrectal HIFU systems have several limitations including the potential for collateral damage due to heat diffusion and minimal real-time ability to monitor treatment efficacy. These limitations associated with the thermal nature of the method delayed FDA approval and subsequent proliferation of this technology. Our joint team at the University of Washington (UW) and Moscow State University (MSU) has recently developed a non-thermal HIFU-based method termed boiling histotripsy (BH). The method uses sequences of milliseconds long HIFU pulses with shock fronts to mechanically fractionate targeted tissue to subcellular levels, with real-time ultrasound imaging feedback. Preliminary analysis by our joint group suggests that delivery of BH treatments with shocks may be feasible using the miniature transrectal probes similar to the existing clinical HIFU systems. The main goal of this project thus is to combine complementary strengths of the UW/MSU teams for developing the BH modality to realize effective and safe focal treatment of PCa. Specifically, we propose to determine relationships among the miniature transducer form-factor, shock wave amplitude at the focus, and BH treatment outcome through numerical modelling (performed at MSU); modeling results will guide the design (at UW) and fabrication of two HIFU probes for BH studies, one at each site. A series of experiments in ex vivo canine tissue (at UW) and human prostatic tissue from autopsy (at MSU) will be performed to develop BH exposures and provide recommendations for the design of BH treatments for future clinical trials (SA2). In SA3, the optimized treatment protocol will be applied more in the orthotopic canine PCa tumor model using a preclinical transrectal BH system developed at UW based on the results from SA1 and SA2. The initial feasibility, safety, and tolerab ility of this intervention will be evaluated in a series of acute and short-term (14 days) survival studies. Comparative morphological analysis of the treatment outcomes will be performed at UW and MSU and ultrastructural analysis will be done at MSU. Mutual visits are planned for major joint experiments on transducer characterization as well as for ex vivo and in vivo studies. We expect that the proposed method of nonthermal ablation of PCa through BH can be translated rapidly to the clinic to improve both the efficacy and safety of focal PCa therapies, thereby improving outcomes with regard to patient oncology and quality of life."
"9466383","PROJECT SUMMARY Polycystic kidney diseases (PKD) are a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive cyst development in the kidney resulting in bilateral renal enlargement and often end stage renal disease (ESRD). The most common form of PKD, autosomal dominant PKD occurs at a frequency of 1:400 to 1:1000. Currently, there is no treatment that can slow or reverse the growth of cysts and progression of the disease. While mouse models have been developed to characterize the pathology and progression of PKD, they tend to be poor indicators of therapeutic success in humans. To solve this, we used our innovative gene-editing platform to prototype four distinct model genotypes in pigs (PKD1R2220W/-; PKD1R3277C/-; PKD1+/R3277C and PKD1+/-), predicted to lower the level of functional polycystin-1 protein (PC1) to 10-50% of normal. We found severe disease in compound heterozygous founders, the first evidence that severe PKD can develop in pigs, whereas heterozygotes had very mild disease. We have established a breeding herd of PKD1+/R3277C and PKD1+/- from which we will breed two models, PKD1R3277C/- (RC-null) and PKD1R3277C/ R3277C (RC-RC). We will produce these two congenital models of ADPKD by standard breeding, and conduct initial analysis on newborn and sale-aged piglets (30 days) to determine the consistency of production and phenotype in the swine products. This analysis will be followed with state-of-the art clinical imaging procedures extending to seven months of age with concordant clinical chemistries to evaluate renal morphology, function, and the development of cysts. Results from these studies will be compared to the pathology and development of PKD in patients and will benchmark the progression of disease in our novel models in a setting consistent with their use in preclinical testing. A second focus of this proposal is to generate a conditional model of ADPKD in a strain of miniature swine. This strain will build on the ADPKD product line with the unique ability to induce disease development shortly after birth for real-time analysis of disease progression, furthermore enabling preclinical evaluation to begin in the earliest phase of disease. The miniature size will also enable chronic studies to proceed past seven months of age where conventional swine outgrow clinical imaging equipment. The development and characterization very specific modified pigs, as described here, are likely to revolutionize ADPKD research and to fast-track treatment options. This is underscored by the tremendous industry support for a PKD model that provides a more rigorous preclinical testing platform."
"9383810","Project Summary The goal of the proposed work is to create bacteria that detect the level of a micronutrient (vitamin or mineral) in a sample, with ultimate application to human blood tests. The micronutrient to be detected is zinc. These cells will enable the later development of minimal-equipment testing of blood zinc levels in remote, resource-poor locations, a significant improvement in both the time and cost necessary using current state-of-the-art methods. The cells use a genetic circuit controlled by zinc-sensitive transcription factors to produce different colored pigment based on the zinc concentration in the sample, indicating whether zinc levels are acceptable or low. Thus, the cells function as a sort of easy-to-read ?bacterial litmus test?. Strong preliminary work supports the likelihood of our success. The first aim involves creating the bacterial strain capable of producing three different pigments in response to different levels of extracellular zinc. The second aim involves making the existing circuit repress pigment production until the assay is performed, allowing for the pre-culture of colorless cells that will enable fast coloration and overcome obstacles to sensor cell survival in human blood samples.The third aim consists of tuning the cells' performance when grown in actual blood samples, since work to date has used laboratory growth medium which may yield different results than growth in the long-term target samples. This project will yield the underlying technology that can be used for the first-ever bacterial blood test for low-resource settings to provide population-level assessment of micronutrient status. By being low-cost and essentially point-of-care, such a long-term result would enable nutritional epidemiologists and policymakers to make more informed decisions about nutritional interventions, as well as to assess the success of interventions after the fact, potentially improving the health of millions of undernourished people. Moreover, the pigment-producing genetic circuit establishes a framework that can be applied for the development of other micronutrient sensors using different nutrient-binding proteins, potentially allowing a whole panel of inexpensive tests."
"9413675","The overarching goal of the proposed Northwestern University (NU) Core Center for Clinical Research (CCCR) is to promote cutting-edge clinical research aimed at prevention or control of rheumatic and musculoskeletal conditions and poor outcomes associated with them.

In the Center for Brain Science at Harvard there is an existing Engineering Core that consists of (a) an integrated laboratory to design, prototype, iterate, and produce custom devices for neuroscience experiments and (b) an engineer-neuroscientist who solves the most challenging engineering problems in the user laboratories and trains young scientists to do this themselves. By adding a dedicated staff engineer, the Engineering Core will be able to support the team-based neuroscience research proposed here. ?The specific aims are to implement engineering solutions to problems faced by the Projects and other Cores. The Engineering Core will (a) design and build apparatuses to image rapidly swimming larval zebrafish; (b) build other apparatuses to quantitatively assay complex zebrafish behavior; (c) build rigs to record neural activity in larval zebrafish brains via calcium imaging; (d) fabricate rigs to record neural activity in larval Drosophila and rat; and modify software for data acquisition in many existing experimental apparatus, including microscopes."
"9346662","PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE INFORMATICS CORE (CORE 3)  The Informatics Core is responsible for clearly communicating the results from the Interaction Projects as  demonstration of a comprehensive and systematic approach for investigating natural product-drug interactions  (NPDIs). Creating a permanent repository with a public portal is crucial in providing access to the organized  raw data, summaries of these results, and background information. Because NPDIs have diverse target  audiences, encompassing researchers, health care practitioners, and the lay public, the Informatics Core must  build a public portal that ensures these users can access the scientific results in a reliable and reproducible  way, as well as enables them to better appreciate the clinical relevance of NPDIs. The Informatics Core brings  together two teams with complementary expertise to meet these goals: the UW Drug Interaction Database  (DIDB) and the WSU College of Communication. Previously successful approaches will be leveraged with  existing resources to build a new repository and public portal ? collectively termed the NaPDI (pronounced  ?nap-dee?) app for Natural Product-Drug Interaction application ? accessible via the Internet. First, the  Informatics Core will establish a permanent and publicly accessible repository for the data resulting from the  Interaction Projects. The DIDB is currently the largest manually curated repository of preclinical and clinical  drug-drug interactions, with a well-vetted standard format for data submission, trained data curators for data  entry, and robust quality assurance procedures. The data submission format will be modified to incorporate  the unique elements of Interaction Projects, such as the NP characterization data generated by the Analytical  Core. Traditional elements of the Interaction Projects, such as the pharmacokinetic data generated by the  Analytical and Pharmacology Cores, also will be entered. Open source technologies will be used to build an  easily maintainable infrastructure in which research data will be stored and displayed in a flexible and user-  friendly format. Second, a user friendly public portal will be created for dissemination of the results from the  Interaction Projects. Validated communications tools will be used to create a public portal that has interactive  features tailored to researchers/practitioners and the lay public to enhance two-way communication regarding  NPDIs. User experience studies, specifically focus group sessions with early versions of the public portal, will  be conducted to optimize clear communication of the Interaction Projects? results. Third, the transparency and  transferability of the NaPDI app will be ensured using open source technologies in a cloud-based environment.  Finally, clear and consistent documentation will be provided to a future successor to the U54 Center.  Leveraging the unique DIDB experience, the Informatics Core is well-equipped to meet the objective of clearly  communicating results from the Interaction Projects, with the NaPDI app representing a novel means to help  improve the safety of the concomitant use of NPs and medications."
"9437360","Abstract Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by inflammation, irreversible fibrosis, and necrosis of pancreatic parenchyma, resulting in exocrine and endocrine insufficiencies. Management of CP patients is particularly challenging due to poor understanding of its pathology, lack of reliable and definitive diagnostic markers and complete absence of therapeutics for interventions. The etiology of CP includes multiple genetic and environmental factors including alcohol, smoking, and high fat diet. Alcohol increases the lysosome and zymogen granules fragility and facilitates the pre-mature activation of proteolytic enzymes in acinar cells, resulting in auto-digestion. This recurring damage to parenchyma activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSC), leading to secretion of various cytokines, growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins likecollagens I, III, and IV, fibronectin, and laminin to promote fibrosis. In addition, pancreatic pathologies have characteristic mucin profile. Mucins (MUC) like MUC1, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6 are upregulated during pancreatitis and shown to play critical role in inflammatory response. Studies have established that pancreatic acinar cells can metabolize alcohol both by oxidative and non-oxidative pathways. The products of ethanol oxidation and smoke exposure include aldehyde, reactive oxygen species, and fatty acid ethyl esters, all of which exert multiple toxic effects on pancreas. Aldehydes can make stable adducts with the intra- and extracellular proteins, modulate their function and are suggested to participate in tissue destruction and fibrosis, act as signaling molecules and elicit immunological response. However, the intricate mechanism and the precise contribution of aldehyde- Our preliminary studies have demonstrated the increase immunoreactivity of the aldehyde adducts (4HNE) in the pancreas of alcohol fed animals. Concurrently, smoke exposure significantly increased the activation of the PSC and upregulate the expression of SMA. herefore, the protein adducts in CP pathology remain elusive. T proposed study is based on the hypothesis that aldehyde protein-adducts mechanistically contribute to the progression of CP and can serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers. Aim 1: Identification and correlation of aldehyde-adducts with pathobiology of CP using murine models. Using appropriate CP mouse model, we will investigate the generation of protein adducts in the alcohol fed and smoke exposed animals and correlated them with the severity of the CP including necrosis, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix proteins. Simultaneously, we will evaluate the adduct formation on the mucins expressed during CP and will further evaluate their diagnostic and prognostic potential. Aim 2: Investigate the mechanistic contribution of aldehyde- adducts during CP using 3D co-culture system. This aim will comprehend the mechanistic contribution of aldehyde- adducts on acinar and PSC cell biology. Taken together, the proposed studies will delineate the contribution of alcohol and smoking mediated proteins adducts in progression of CP that will provide novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets."
"9447889","Project Summary The microbes that inhabit the human body are viewed as an integral component of our biology, and microbiome variability has been found to result in differences in disease predisposition. The proposed research will develop and apply methods to infer how variation in the human genome mediates composition and function of the gut microbiome. To achieve this objective, we will pursue four specific aims in an analysis of genome-wide SNP genotype data already available from the TwinsUK project to identify genetic determinants of microbiome composition. For Specific Aim 1, we will use whole- genome sequence data of the twins along with deep metagenomic sequencing of their gut microbiomes to infer heritability and gene-specific associations with a) greater resolution taxonomic data, and b) metabolic attributes of the bacterial community. These data are already in hand, and provide unique opportunities to dissect the means by which variation in the human genome mediates gut microbiome properties. For Specific Aim 2, we will infer individual strains in the gut microbiomes from the metagenomics data, making use of the fact that our sequencing depth is sufficient to identify clonal haplotypes of the most common ~50 bacterial species. The biological impacts of specific strains can vary widely, and this strain-specific analysis is likely to be highly informative by improving specificity and accuracy of associations between host genes and microbiome composition. For Specific Aim 3, we will resample 1000 individuals from the original TwinsUK microbiome survey, and use this information to identify attributes of the gut microbiome that are stable over time, and to test the relationship between heritability and stability of microbes in the microbiome. For Specific Aim 4, we will use the gnotobiotic mouse experimental system to dissect the effects of the heritable bacterium Christensenella minuta on gut function as well has whole-organism physiology. The results of this research will be used to establish links between regions of the human genome and composition of the microbiome. The results of this study have the potential to reveal fundamental human host-microbe interactions that may be applicable to the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases."
"9468094","The World Health Organization estimates that by 2020, major depressive disorder (MDD) will be the most common cause of disability, worldwide. Although approximately 1 in 6 Americans will suffer from MDD during their lifetime, many patients with MDD go undiagnosed in primary care settings, and 20% are incorrectly diagnosed with MDD. Given the substantial medical, economic and social costs involved with MDD, there is tremendous need for a simple objective biomarker test to aid clinicians in accurately identifying MDD. No test currently exists that can accurately diagnose MDD and distinguish it from other psychiatric conditions. Further, clinical response to antidepressant therapy requires as much as two months. There is enormous need for a test that can predict response within a few days of the inception of treatment. The potential market for an accurate diagnostic test for MDD is estimated at $5-8B annually. Payers of medical services would cover the cost of such a diagnostic test because accurately identifying and treating MDD would reduce the high medical costs arising from medical service delivery to patients with untreated depression, as well as improving outcomes for patients with comorbid medical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.  Another market for an MDD diagnostic test is pharmaceutical companies. These companies have uniformly retreated from discovery efforts in mood disorders, in part due to large- scale failure of numerous clinical trials. Part of the reason for these failures is the enrollment of inappropriate patients. An objective test of MDD could address this concern by providing certainty about the appropriateness of recruited subjects.  The Pax Neuroscience diagnostic biomarker G?s Sequestration Assay (GSA) indicates that MDD patients have a significantly greater proportion of G?s captured in lipid rafts compared to non-depressed controls and can accurately identify patients suffering from MDD. Pax used the same principles that underpin the GSA to develop a C6 glioma (G?s -GFP) FRAP assay which can reliably predict antidepressant efficacy. The proposed studies will convert that assay into high content screening (HCS) format, enabling an HCS campaign to find novel small molecules that target MDD. In addition we will develop a secondary screen using Neural Stem Cells, i n d u c e d from f i b r o b l a s t s o f d e p r e s s e d subjects with known responses to antidepressants (SSRIs), to confirm the efficacy of the screen. This secondary screen can be modified to evaluate treatment efficacy in MDD patients. This is an exciting proposal that offers an underlying technology that can both find new drugs and develop personalized therapy for depression."
"9456032","ABSTRACT: Improving Veteran Access to Integrated Management of Chronic Back Pain LBP is among the most prevalent and disabling medical problems for Veterans. Improving patient care for LBP is a high priority for many federal agencies and recent clinical practice guidelines emphasize the importance of non-pharmacological management of LBP. However, optimal care pathways involving non-pharmacological treatments have not been established. Care pathways aligned with a ?biopsychosocial? conceptualization of LBP are highly valued, but are rarely delivered in routine practice environments and still need to be investigated for their effectiveness. The overall goal of this UG3 (Planning Phase)/UH3 (Demonstration Project) proposal is to improve access to recommended non-pharmacologic therapies for LBP in the Department of VA Health Care System. In UG3 phase trial planning will be accomplished through two aims: 1) establish policies, procedures, and regulatory agreements for data management and resource sharing needs and 2) finalize research design and clinical protocols needed to conduct a high-quality, multi-center pragmatic cluster randomized trial. The pragmatic cluster randomized trial proposed for the UH3 Demonstration Project will compare the effectiveness of two LBP management approaches designed to enhance access to non- pharmacological pain treatments and biopsychosocial oriented care: a) sequenced, multi-modal integrated care pathway incorporating physical pain treatment, tailored behavioral treatment, and home base activity versus 2) care management by pain navigator program that facilitates coordinated use of existing VA or non- VA pain management resources. With clinical practice guidelines in mind, both pathways have been purposefully structured to include non-pharmacological pain modulation. Veterans enrolled in the trial (n = 1,250) will be followed for primary outcomes (PROMIS Short Form scores for pain interference and function) captured from the electronic health record and a subset (n = 630) will complete phone captured patient reported secondary augment electronic health record capture. In Aim 1 we will examine the effectiveness of a sequenced, multi-modal integrated care pathway for LBP, compared to a care management by pain navigator program. Our central hypothesis is that the multi-modal, integrated care pathway will reduce pain interference with normal activities and improve physical function compared with the care management program. In Aim 2 we will determine participant characteristics associated with greater improvements in pain interference and function, and better adherence to each care pathway. Aim 2 will inform the potential for matching Veteran subgroup characteristics to a specific care pathway that provides greater potential for improvement in pain and function. This proposal is directly aligned with primary goals of the NIH-DoD-VA Pain Management Collaboratory by aligning existing VA health system resources to expand capacity to deliver earlier non- pharmacological pain management for the Veteran with LBP."

"9485640","Investigator Development Core: Abstract Representation of underrepresented minority professionals in biomedical workforce is critical for addressing the issues related to changing demographics in the United Sates. Therefore, it is essential to increase the diversity in the research workforce that focuses on minority health and health disparities. Career advancement for faculty conducting research is measured by their ability to obtain external funding. The objective of Investigator Development core (IDC) is to train and support the eligible scholars (post-doctoral fellows, junior faculty and early stage investigators) to establish successful extramural research programs and mentor them for a successful research career. We have developed the Steps Toward Academic Research (STAR) Leadership program that provides training, pilot project support through U54 mechanism and from institutional funds. IDC will work closely with the Program Executive Committee and Community Engagement and Dissemination Core to accomplish this objective. In Aim 1, we will implement the STAR Leadership program for scholars to develop competitive research grant applications in minority health and health disparities. Our diversity recruitment plan recruits 10 scholars each year, and provides intensive training for effective grant writing, conducting health disparity research, and developing research proposals working with subject experts and community stakeholders. In Aim 2, we will conduct rigorous peer-review to select 3-5 new pilot projects each year to fund investigator-initiated minority health and health disparity research. We will also support pilot project awardees for the successful completion of their projects adhering with NIHMD research frame work by providing post-award support including institutional resources (eg., access to core facilities, statistical expertise, manuscript and grant writing support). In order to appreciate and encourage promising investigators, we will assess project performance and supplement the scholars with high potential for extramural funding with a second year of support through institutional funds. In Aim 3, we will immerse our scholars into the network of faculty and professionals conducting minority health and health disparity research. Scholars will be connected with UNTHSC partners, NRMN and NIMHD professional development and networking programs.

"9331641","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overactive bladder (OAB), often associated with detrusor overactivity (DO), is a debilitating pathological condition affecting more than 34 million Americans, at an annual cost of more than $65 billion in the US alone. Current OAB therapies are limited in efficacy and relief. Novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed, especially those that directly target detrusor smooth muscle (DSM), in order to facilitate DSM relaxation during bladder filling and urinary storage. We are the first to identify functional Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) melastatin-4 (TRPM4) channels in human DSM and we have shown that TRPM4 channel expression is much higher in DSM as compared to the vasculature. This project will examine the novel concept that the Ca2+- activated TRPM4 channels have a key role in human DSM excitability and contractility and that inhibition of TRPM4 channels decreases DSM contractility. Our central hypothesis is that TRPM4 channels play critical roles in human DSM physiology and the etiology of DO/OAB, and therefore represent a novel therapeutic target for DO/OAB treatment. Our strategy is to use a multi-level experimental approach at molecular, cellular, tissue, and whole organism levels. We have the unique advantage of regularly using clinically-characterized human DSM tissues from open bladder surgeries on control (non-OAB) and OAB patients. Aim 1 will use multiple state-of-the-art approaches including single-cell RT-PCR, qPCR, Western blot, in situ proximity ligation assay, confocal immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical analyses of DSM whole tissue and single cells to identify the TRPM4 channel expression and localization in human DSM cells from control and OAB patients. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of TRPM4 channels in the excitability of freshly- isolated (not cultured) native human DSM cells from control and OAB patients and their functional link with IP3 receptors. This aim will use advanced electrophysiological approaches, live-cell Ca2+ imaging, and the novel selective TRPM4 channel inhibitor, 9-phenanthrol. Aim 3 will elucidate the functional roles of TRPM4 channels in myogenic and nerve-evoked contractions of human DSM tissues from control and OAB patients, and in vivo in mice. We propose that TRPM4 channels are novel targets for DSM dysfunction and their pharmacological modulation offers a previously unexplored mechanism for treating bladder disorders. Targeting TRPM4 channels with selective inhibitors has the potential to reduce DO and alleviate OAB. Therefore, this investigation has important clinical significance. The highly innovative nature of this translational research is strengthened by the collaboration between basic scientists and urologists, allowing the linking of molecular (Aim 1), cellular (Aim 2), tissue, and in vivo (Aim 3 findings. Upon completion of this project, the regulation of human DSM by TRPM4 channels under physiological and pathophysiological conditions will be revealed. The knowledge gained from this project will advance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating human DSM function and dysfunction and validate TRPM4 channels as a novel therapeutic modality for OAB."
"9466321","Project Summary  For modern flow cytometry, high-throughput multiplexing is extremely important because of the great need in analyzing a large number of biomolecules on and in a single cell. The multiplexing performance of flow cytometry is hindered by the probe performance including their fluorescence brightness and emission bandwidth. However, there is renewed interest and effort to develop highly multiplexed (e.g. ~20-30 probes) fluorescence based flow cytometry analysis of cells. For this high degree of multiplexing with fluorescence, both probe brightness and narrow emission are critical - specifically, because of how compensation for spectral spillover works, a very bright probe greatly facilitates multiplexing by minimizing spillover spreading, which is a key driver for extremely bright probes in flow cytometry. The ability to detect low- expression antigens is also another important capability provided by very bright probes. Recently, we and others have developed fluorescent nanoparticles based on semiconducting polymers called Pdots. The motivation of adapting fluorescent semiconducting polymers into nanoparticle labels stems from a number of favorable characteristics, such as large absorptivity, high quantum yield, fast emission rates, and excellent photostability. The resulting Pdots exhibit extraordinarily high fluorescence brightness under both one-photon and two-photon excitations, a factor of 102 - 104 higher than conventional fluorescent dyes, and a factor of 10-103 higher than Qdots depending on the particle size. We have successfully designed and prepared a Pdot series with 405nm excitation. Following on this successful development, we propose to design three additional Pdot series for flow cytometry, excitable at 355nm, 488nm, and 561nm, thus matching the laser wavelengths of existing flow cytometers."
"9472656","Project Summary/Abstract High throughput screening promises to help both drug discovery and therapeutic response to personalized medicine. A challenge to the development of tissue constructs is the lack of an effective noninvasive assay that is capable to monitor cellular anatomy and physiology. The major limitation of efficacy testing in in vitro models is the cost and inefficiency of histologic preparation. Our group has recently developed a confocal imaging approach to create images that mimic the contrast mechanisms and even the appearance of standard Hematoxylin and eosin-stained histology nondestructively on whole tissue specimens. Our technique, which is noninvasive and relatively easy to perform, may enable high-throughput cellular analysis of 3D bioprinted skin constructs (3DBPS) such that longitudinal drug screening experiments can be supported. Although 3DBPS can test a variety of disease models and drug targets, we will begin working with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as a model, based on our experience in this area. This project builds and characterizes a 3DBPS model of SCC, defines imaging biomarkers for SCC as verified by histology in order to characterize treatment by known chemotherapeutic agents, and monitors drug response using the imaging biomarkers defined for SCC 3DBPS. Data generated will be used as a standard to rapidly and non-destructively screen novel, potential cancer anti-cancer drugs. Successful completion of this project will yield a new drug discovery platform for rapid, parallel and massive testing of chemotherapeutic agents."

"9528113","DESCRIPTION:   My goal in seeking a Mentored Research Career Development Award is to acquire the necessary training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator who harnesses biomedical Big Data Science for the investigation of multilevel influences on health. To continue my progress towards this goal, I am proposing to build the infrastructure to establish a neighborhood data repository, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers and policy makers. I am a highly trained researcher in social epidemiology and quantitative analyses, particularly large health surveys. Before coming to Utah, I worked as a full-time statistical programmer/data analyst on a NIH-funded project to evaluate the health effects of a large neighborhood relocation policy experiment on low-income families in five cities. Our study results suggested that moving from high- to lower poverty neighborhood is related to reductions in obesity and diabetes and improved mental health. Other extant research has provided evidence on associations between the neighborhood environment and mortality and morbidity-even after adjusting for individual characteristics. Poor access to healthy food, fast food chains, the lack of recreational facilities, and higher crime rates all correlate with hiher obesity rates. Nonetheless, the dearth of neighborhood data, especially measures of neighborhood quality that are consistent across geographic areas, limits neighborhood effects research. Moreover, neighborhoods are not only defined by their resources, but also by the social interactions and activities of people who live there. The widespread usage of the internet and open recording of many transactions has led to the availability of massive amounts of data that permits capture of previously hidden micro-level interactions. We will build the data algorithms and infrastructure to harness relatively untapped, cost efficient, and pervasive social media data to develop neighborhood indicators such as food themes, healthiness of food mentions, frequency of exercise/recreation mentions, metabolic intensity of physical activities, and happiness levels. The creation of HashtagHealth requires the use and refinement of Big Data methods to perform data mining, processing and storing of heterogeneous, unstructured data. We will build a testable version of HashtagHealth for the state of Utah and then apply the data resource to the examination of neighborhood effects on young adult obesity. My rigorous training and previous research experiences in social determinants of health, causal inference, and data analyses uniquely prepare me to make significant contributions to the field of Big Data, particularly at the intersection of public health and social sciences.  My Specific Aims are: 1) to develop a neighborhood data resource, HashtagHealth, for public health researchers, 2) to develop Big Data techniques to produce novel neighborhood quality indicators (e.g., healthiness of food mentions, frequency and type of exercise/recreation and happiness levels), and 3) to utilize HashtagHealth and individual-level data from the Utah Population Database to investigate neighborhood influences on obesity among young adults. My mentorship team includes experts in biomedical research (Drs. Ken Smith, Jim VanDerslice), computer science (Dr. Feifei Li), and statistics (Dr. Ming Wen). My team has the breadth of expertise to help me obtain critical multidisciplinary skills and successfully implement my research aims. In addition to my research aims, my Specific Career Development Aims include the following: 1) to develop expertise in data mining and database systems, 2) to acquire training in natural language processing and machine learning, 3) to further gain knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS), 4) to develop expertise in study design and analysis of neighborhood effects, and 5) and to develop grant writing and research management skills to lead future projects. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to successfully compete for R01 funding to create a national neighborhood data repository and to investigate national patterns of neighborhood effects on obesity. This proposal makes significant, relevant contributions to the field because 1) neighborhood environments are increasingly linked to important health outcomes, and 2) this project addresses the limits to research resulting from the lack of neighborhood data by providing new, cost-efficient data resources and methods for characterizing neighborhoods."
"9444314","The proposed project seeks to determine the manner in which genetically mediated psychological and metabolic factors influence risk for anorexia nervosa (AN) using a prospective longitudinal design. AN is a disorder of considerable public health importance due to high chronicity, low recovery rates, high mortality, and significant individual and family costs. Despite years of research, we still understand little about the pathophysiology of AN, hampering the development of pharmacological interventions and early intervention strategies. Recent findings from our investigative team suggest that body mass, metabolic factors, and growth patterns might not only prospectively predict AN onset, but also might reflect underlying genetic contributions of these parameters to illness risk. Extending these findings, the overarching aims of our proposed research are: first, to test if high genetic risk for AN and low genetic risk for obesity (using polygenic risk scores) are associated with a broad and narrow AN phenotypes; second, to examine associations between these polygenic risk scores and metabolic, growth, and body composition patterns prior to AN onset; and third, to determine whether high genetic risk for AN and low genetic risk for obesity are associated with severity and persistence of AN. We will leverage the considerable wealth of existing data in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a longitudinal population-based cohort that includes existing genome-wide, metabolic, growth, body composition data, as well as data on AN behaviours and AN diagnoses with measurements from before birth to age 25 on ~7,000 individuals. Our findings will clarify the developmental pathophysiology of AN, contribute to deepening the understanding of the biology and genetics of the illness, and potentially inform the development of effective approaches to treatment of this too often lethal illness."
"9416007","Project Summary (Overall) For the brain (or any other biological systems), cells are a fundamentally important level of organization between genes/molecules and networks/systems. The mammalian brain is composed of millions to billions of neurons and non-neuronal cells with diverse properties and extremely intricate connections to form highly specific and hierarchically organized circuits and networks. To unravel the principles of information processing in brain circuits, it is essential to have a systematic understanding of its components ? the cell types, and to have tools to monitor and manipulate them in the living brain to probe their roles in the circuits. However, it is still unclear how many cell types there are in the brain and how to even define them. Recent high-throughput technology advancement, especially in the areas of sequencing and imaging, has created an unprecedented opportunity to collect comprehensive information about individual cells in large scales to enable data-driven cell type classification. We will form a Comprehensive Center on Mouse Brain Cell Atlas, and our goal is to create a comprehensive whole-brain atlas of cell types in the mouse encompassing molecular, anatomical and functional annotations of cell types. We will conduct large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis across the entire mouse brain, as well as systematic sampling of neuronal morphology and connectivity in a wide range of brain areas. In selected proof-of-principle cases, we will examine the correspondence among the transcriptomic, morphological, connectional and/or functional properties of the same cells, to gain an understanding what defines a cell type. Finally, we will generate a census of the number and location of cells for each type, and new genetic tools targeting selected cell types. We will establish a Data Core to provide data management systems for integrating the diverse data collections and to provide data processing and mapping infrastructure and expertise to transform raw data into quantitative cell characterization features. We will also establish an Administrative Core to address the operational management of the Center, including fiscal management, project management, strategic planning, progress reporting, and support for collaboration and communication. Altogether this project will create a first version of a comprehensive cell type atlas for an entire mammalian brain with enduring values to the community towards the understanding of brain function in healthy and diseased states."
"9569799","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma affects 5% of the world population. In the U.S., asthma death rates are four-fold higher in Latinos and African Americans compared to Whites. Latinos and African Americans have varying degrees of African, European, and Native American genetic ancestry. This genetic heterogeneity has important clinical implications. In fact, we demonstrated that we can improve the diagnosis of lung disease among African Americans by as much as 15% by including genetic measures of ancestry into clinical lung function prediction equations (NEJM). We improved upon our results by incorporating sub-continental Native American ancestry into clinical lung function prediction equations for Latinos (Science). We also demonstrated that exposure to air pollution is associated with increased asthma risk among Latino and African American children, and that this increase in risk was greatest among African American children (AJRCCM). Subsequently, we demonstrated that environmental and social risk factors cannot fully explain the correlation between genetic ancestry and asthma severity and lung function (JACI). Clearly, we demonstrated that ancestry plays a strong role in determining normal clinical measures such as lung function and asthma severity. We hypothesize that gene- environment interactions contribute to population differences in lung function and asthma severity following exposure to air pollution. Racial/ethnic differences in the frequency and composition of genetic variation likely play an important role in asthma severity. To test this hypothesis we recruited the largest gene-environment study of asthma among minority children in the U.S. (N > 10,000). Our goal is to use integrative genomics to identify gene-by-air pollution interactions that influence lung function and asthma severity in minority children. We will leverage existing 1,600 whole genome sequences with air pollution-induced gene expression in nasal airway epithelial cells (NECs) from children with mild and severe asthma. We will integrate individual-level whole genome sequencing data with precise cell-level genetic and exposure-response experiments. We will identify genetic risk factors and gene-environment interactions that contribute to asthma severity, and determine cellular response mechanisms that mediate poor lung function and severe asthma using NECs exposed to air pollution."
"9465618","! ABSTRACT Significance: Spinal cord injuries (SCI) cause costly and morbid chronic conditions such as lack of voluntary movement, increased chance of pressure sores, problematic spasticity, loss of bowel, bladder, and sexual function, and more physical impairments which result in a lower quality of life and lack of independence. Approximately 285,000 people in the U.S. have SCI with ~17,000 new patients added each year. Current treatment options include an array of electrical stimulation interventions or high-intensity fitness regimens, but all share one common limitation of being episodic in their treatment delivery. There is a compelling need for a treatment option that can be used daily, improves Activities of Daily Living (ADL?s), allows for in- home rehab and most importantly provides patient independence. Enabling technology exists, often proven in other medical device applications, that can facilitate the design of an upper limb orthotic system to deliver the functional performance required by SCI patients. The OlympEX Medical Actively Powered Exoskeleton (APEX) device can meet the functional movement requirements, will be designed for in-home use and be affordable to the user. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the APEX orthotic system will achieve clinically meaningful improvement in a SCI patient?s range of motion (ROM) capability to perform ADL?s and to perform upper limb rehab in an in-home setting. Preliminary Work: The APEX orthotic system will be the third generation of orthotic device system to be developed by OlympEX Medical. Generations 1 and 2 are passively powered device systems that have provided the OlympEX design engineering team experience with mechanical apparatus requirements to elevate an upper limb. Likewise, the team has developed capabilities in advanced materials for the body chassis for these devices. The APEX orthotic system evolves from these product platforms to introduce system features in device guidance and user control only obtainable with an actively powered system. Specific Aims: This project entails the APEX hardware/electronic architecture development and the acute pre-clinical evaluation of the system on N=3 patients to evaluate patient safety and device feasibility. In Specific Aim 1 we will design, fabricate and evaluate the APEX mechanical design with electronic architecture. A subset of the APEX functional arm movements will be developed to demonstrate feasibility in performing a limited number of high priority ADL?s. In Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate the performance of this subset of ADL?s on 3 SCI patients. Success criteria will be Pass/Fail as evaluated by clinicians. In addition, an initial patient safety assessment will be completed. Safety factors including discomfort or pain before and after the fitting of the device and no uncontrolled arm movements will be evaluated. Together, these studies will demonstrate the feasibility of APEX device to guide arm movements required to complete ADL?s and therapeutic arm movements in an ambulatory setting. !"
"9356789","Core 1: Pathology SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT The individual research projects comprising this Ovarian Cancer SPORE application require the procurement, processing, and analysis of histopathological material from patients with ovarian cancer and benign ovarian diseases. The research projects have needs for frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of tumor and normal tissue. The proposed Pathology Core augments the already established MD Anderson Cancer Center Gynecological Tumor Bank and the P30-sponsored MD Anderson Cancer Center Centralized Tissue Repository with supporting database and intranet access. The Core provides for tissue acquisition by experienced gynecological pathologists to assure high-quality tissues for the investigators participating in this SPORE as well as investigators of other SPOREs. The goal of the Pathology Core is to provide frozen tissue, paraffin-embedded tissue, and histopathological expertise related to the specific needs of the research projects comprising this SPORE proposal. To achieve this goal, the Pathology Core proposes the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 is to maintain a frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue repository of ovarian cancer, benign ovarian processes, and normal ovary. The primary tissue source will be operative and biopsy specimens submitted to the Department of Pathology at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Aim 2 is to provide pathological review for all clinical specimens utilized in the SPORE projects and to provide histopathological technical services as necessary. Such technical services include immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, creation of specific tissue microarray slides, pathological evaluation of mouse tumors, and microdissection of tissue sections. Aim 3 is to establish a blood/urine/ascites fluid repository from patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer and benign ovarian processes. These fluids will provide the resources for the testing of putative prognostic and diagnostic markers derived from experiments in the SPORE projects. Aim 4 is to create and maintain a relational SPORE Database for all samples collected by the Pathology Core. This SPORE Database will provide for a virtual tissue repository that can be shared electronically with all SPORE investigators."
"9341800","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In developing countries, anemia is a major public health problem including children and pregnant women. In Africa, the prevalence of anemia is extremely high, affecting two thirds of preschool-age children and a half of women. When anemia is not detected and managed in a timely manner, it can result in major health consequences, including fatigue, heart failure, pregnancy disorders and poor physical/cognitive conditions. Early and accurate diagnosis of anemia can reduce a need for complicated treatments.  Although portable (in-house) or point-of-care blood analyzers are currently available, these still remain unaffordable and inadequate in low- and middle-income country settings. Clinical examinations, digital photography, and smartphone-based noninvasive measurements have also received attention, but these still lack sensitivity and specificity for anemia diagnosis. Considering the imperative clinical need in developing countries, the `right' technology would be an accurate and sensitive noninvasive hemoglobin measuring technology that can easily be embedded into conventional mobile smartphones.  We will develop a mobile smartphone-based noninvasive spectrometer-less hemoglobin analyzer (mHema) and to conduct studies with Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) program in Kenya. Our approach takes advantage of virtual hyperspectral (each pixel has detailed color information) imaging to have similar results compared with laboratory-based hemoglobin tests (gold standard). This platform will be implemented as a user-friendly application in conventional mobile smartphones. We propose the following three specific aims: i) develop a two-step algorithm for accurate and sensitive hemoglobin quantification, ii) implement the hemoglobin detection algorithm within an electronic health record system- integrated smartphone application, and iii) evaluate the performance characteristics of mHema in a real-world clinical setting in Kenya.  As the proposed study is at the intersection of medical device development, clinical laboratory testing, and computer science, our interdisciplinary team is well poised to carry out this proposed work as a part of AMPATH. Given that the detection technology is completely noninvasive and rapid, we will piggyback patients undergoing routine blood tests. Successful completion of the planned studies will facilitate clinical translation of this mobile application tool and maximize the quality of current available standard of care. This work will provide a foundation to comprehensively evaluate the accuracy and precision of mHema for a larger patient population with a broader set of conditions, further serving as a model clinical setting to tailor our technology for other resource-limited settings."
"9404863","Project 3 Abstract Viral oncogenesis is responsible of 20% of total cancer. In particular, KSHV and HPV are the most common oncogenic viruses infecting millions of patients per year. Although the efficiency of these viruses to alter cell cycle regulation and manipulate cell signal pathways they need a co-cofactor to develop neoplastic lesions. Frequently, HIV co-infection is the most important association with KSHV and HPV because attenuates immune response. Active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has become an effective therapy but at time patients progress and require additional treatments . Galectin-1 (Gal1), a glycan binding protein with immunosuppressive effects modulates tumor microenvironments by inducing apoptosis of activated T cells, promoting IL-27- Foxp3+ Tregs. Recently, we have tolerogenic dendritic cells and expanding demonstrated that Gal1-N-glycans on VEGFR2 links tumor hypoxia to aberrant angiogenesis and preserves vascularization in anti-VEGF refractory tumors facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. These data, suggest that targeting Gal1-N-glycan interactions may overcome resistance to anti-cancer therapies by promoting compensatory angiogenesis and by potentiating immune responses. Specific changes in the glycome and up-regulation of Gal1 in infected viral oncogenic-cells seems to be the key for the development of a new generation of therapies for sarcoma kaposi tumors and HPV-associated malignancies. Anti-Gal1 mAbs could re-educate immune system improving actual therapies. In this project, we propose to use an interdisciplinary approach to explore the Gal1-N-glycan axis as a potential player in pathogenesis of viral-associated tumors by fine tuning critical signaling pathways and promoting oncogenic inflammation with the ultimate goal to improve a new generation diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at limiting tumor growth by suppressing PDGFRA-dependent aberrant signaling and potentiating antitumor immunity."
"9449084","PROJECT SUMMARY AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT ABSTRACT  Rett syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder for which there are currently no viable treatment strategies. The majority of RTT cases result from loss of function mutations in a transcription factor known as methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), and knockout of Mecp2 (Mecp2-KO) results in RTT- like phenotypes and pathologies in rodents. The brains of RTT-model mice are characterized by acquired microcephaly, which results not from neural atrophy, but rather a reduction in synapses and the subsequent simplification of the neuronal arbor. As such, the preclinical treatment strategies that have garnered the most attention are those designed to normalize synaptic density, often through the replacement of late response (LR) or direct modulation of their receptors. In this capacity RTT-mouse models are valuable tools to guide therapeutic design; however, given the challenges associated with translating data from mice to humans, we have recently adopted a different strategy. Using cortical and cerebellar tissue from 8 RTT patients, we performed RNA-sequencing (seq) analysis to screen for novel points of intervention that are rooted in human patient data, and then back-modeled relevant hits in mice. Excitingly, we identified the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) as a gene significantly decreased in RTT patients. This finding is salient, as M4-modulators have been shown to rescue symptom domains in diseases like schizophrenia that overlap with RTT and M4- KO mice have cognitive and social deficits similar to Mecp2-KO mice. This raises the exciting possibility that attenuated M4 expression and signaling could be underlying cognitive and social phenotypes in RTT patients. In Aim 1, we propose to further develop preliminary data indicating that cognitive and social phenotypes in Mecp2-KO mice are responsive to M4 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). In Aim 2, we propose to conclusively link M4-signaling to RTT in patients by perform an RNA-seq analysis on autopsy samples from patients that have been clinically diagnosed with RTT, but who do not have mutations in MECP2 (MECP2- mutation negative). Finally, in Aim 3 we propose co-administer our M4-PAM with modulators of glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling, to establish whether a complimentary symptom domains can be rescued.  My career goal is to become the head of a lab with a research focus on pediatric diseases of the nervous system, and I have identified four areas of insufficient training that I propose to remedy to assist in achieving long term success in that role. The four areas are: 1) Training in electrophysiology 2) Training next generation sequencing analysis 3) Clinical exposure to RTT and 4) Mentor experience. To remove these technical and conceptual barriers, I have developed a training plan that integrates formal didactic training with hands-on mentorship, with the goal of turning these weaknesses into strengths. It is anticipated that completion of the proposed project and training plan will place me in an ideal position to receive a tenure track faculty position, and as such, I believe that this application is well suited for a K01 Career Development Award."
"9418807","Abstract - CREP The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research and Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT-CHD), a partnership between Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) and Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC), presents a unique opportunity for joint efforts to advance biospecimen-based research in cancer health disparities. There is an unmet need for cancer researchers who are culturally competent with unique expertise to conduct health disparities research. The Cancer Research Education Program is an integral component of the SPIRIT-CHD and is designed to meet this need. The CREP will be a joint, collaborative, innovative program with three primary aims: Research Experiences, Curriculum, and Outreach. 1. (Research Experiences): to provide undergraduate and medical students with hands on summer research experiences that address biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. We will build upon and expand an infrastructure between the LSUHSC and MCC for biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities research training for undergraduate and medical students with emphasis on underrepresented minority (URM) students. Over the funding period, we expect to train a total of 44 trainees. 2. (Curriculum): to provide students with formal training in cancer research, focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. All students (LSUHSC and MCC) will share the same overall curriculum: a) a series of web-based modules, b) experiences in cancer health disparities research, biobanking, precision medicine and biomedical ethics, and c) didactic learning activities. 3. (Outreach): to expand existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) by engaging summer interns in outreach education activities to minority communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. Specifically, this infrastructure will provide students with opportunity for immersion experiences and for skill development in communicating about biobanking, precision medicine, and cancer health disparities research to lay audiences. We have incorporated formative (process) and summative (impact/outcome) evaluation metrics into each of the activities associated with the three aims. These processes will help to monitor and gauge success as well as pinpoint areas for improvement and refinement. The CREP will help to create the next generation of clinical and research scientists who are prepared to address the challenges of cancer health disparities research in relation to precision medicine and participation in biobanking. We also expect this educational program to generate preliminary data that will lead to competitive grant applications for extramural peer-reviewed funding by NIH/NCI (e.g., R25e)."
"9442430","Project Summary  Resistance to existing antimicrobial drug classes continues to spread in bacterial pathogens of man and other animals. The pipe-line of new antimicrobials or their alternatives is limited, and the timeline is uncertain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stated the risk of ?running out of drugs to treat serious Gram-negative infections?. Of these, nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica infections cause thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths annually in the U.S. and are often foodborne. The first-line treatment choices for serious salmonellosis are fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin) and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone). The current treatment regimens were designed using the pharmacodynamic, PD, data for the pathogen strains that were highly susceptible to the drugs; the regimens are ineffective against the strains with reduced susceptibility that continue to spread. Recent experimental data show there may be predictable and consistent changes in an antimicrobial's PD for the reduced susceptibility strains compared to the susceptible strains within a pathogen species. Also, all relevant PD parameter values change, not only the drug minimum inhibitory concentrations for the strains (which is often the only metric considered in making decisions about the regimens). This signals a possibility the treatment regimens for existing antimicrobials could be modified to cure infections by the strains that have acquired reduced susceptibility. The long-term objective is to determine the PD changes between the susceptible and reduced susceptibility strains of pathogens in which antimicrobial resistance is of biggest concern, to enable design of the modified treatment regimens. The specific objective for this proposal is to determine the PD changes in nontyphoidal S. enterica for the two first-line antimicrobials. The first aim is to determine the PD parameter value changes for ciprofloxacin between S. enterica strains that are susceptible, and that carry genetic determinants of reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility most often detected in this foodborne pathogen in the U.S. The second aim is to determine the PD parameter value changes for ceftriaxone between S. enterica strains that are susceptible, and that carry genetic determinants of reduced cephalosporin susceptibility most often detected in this foodborne pathogen in the U.S. The third aim is to investigate whether the PD changes in the S. enterica strains that have just acquired fluoroquinolone or cephalosporin resistance via horizontal plasmid transfer are similar to those in circulating field strains that acquired such resistance at an earlier time. Thus, the project will provide the ground data on the PD changes between the susceptible and reduced susceptibility strains of nontyphoidal S. enterica for the two first-line treatment choices: the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin and the extended spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone. This will enable the research team to evaluate how the treatment regimens could be modified to cure infections by the pathogen strains that have acquired reduced susceptibility to these drugs, and thus to prolong the usable life-span of these critically important antimicrobials.

"9396428","PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing epidemic in the United States, and continues to increase with the aging population. CKD is generally progressive and irreversible, with complications including cardiovascular disease and progression to end-stage renal disease. Consequently, there is a compelling need to reduce the complications of CKD.  Unfortunately, managing CKD is limited by the lack of disease-specific treatments, and we must rely on broad, indirect strategies to reduce the risk of poor CKD outcomes. These strategies rely heavily on CKD patients to actively participate in behavior changes that promote health and manage the disease (e.g., adhere to blood pressure medications, participate in healthy behaviors, etc.), collectively referred to as self- management behaviors. To date, research of self-management among those with pre-dialysis CKD is limited, although early CKD is arguably the most critical time to limit disease progression and prevent complications.  The overall objectives of this study, within the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, a large pre-dialysis CKD cohort, include: 1) describing engagement in CKD self-management behaviors overall and by key characteristics, 2) exploring for sub-groups of individuals with specific patterns of CKD self-management engagement, 3) assessing for potential predictors of engaging in CKD self-management behaviors, and 4) investigating the association of CKD self-management engagement with long and short term clinical outcomes. Through these initial analyses, we aim to gain insights into CKD self-management engagement and its association to clinical outcomes in a pre-dialysis CKD cohort. We anticipate this project will yield critical insights into the clinical factors associated with CKD self-management engagement and will generate new hypotheses to drive future research in the area of improving CKD self-management through the identification of barriers to self-management engagement and groups at the highest risk for poor outcomes.  The proposed application for the NRSA fellowship award will provide Dr. Schrauben with intensive training in clinical epidemiology, biostatistics, health behavior and health literacy research, multifaceted career development with complementary mentors with diverse backgrounds, support her to generate high-quality data, perform statistical analysis, interpret the findings, and prepare manuscripts for publication. Ultimately, Dr. Schrauben will gain skills that will enable her to mature as an investigator and compete successfully for a K- level career development award to further understand the role of self-management in CKD and help inform targeted interventions in high-risk groups."

The Functional Genomics Theme uses genetically engineered mouse models and patient-derived xenograft analysis to determine the significance of genetic alterations in human cancer as identified by the Computational Biology Theme. The Cell Signaling Theme functions to conduct in vitro mechanistic analysis of signaling pathways identified by the Computational and Functional Genomics Theme to determine how these pathways regulate cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. The role of this group is to identify which pathways are targets for biomarkers or therapeutic development. Finally, the Translational Theme consists of clinical researchers and researchers involved in development of novel therapeutics. The goal of this Theme is to facilitate the translation of the basic science findings of the CBP to the patient. This group aids CBP researchers in determining how these findings can be translated to the development of therapies and biomarkers for the treatment of cancer."
"9551792","PROJECT ABSTRACT Cirrhosis is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States, however patient treatment for hepatic fibrosis is essentially non-existent. Fibrillogenesis, defined by chemical cross-linking of alpha I and other fibrillar collagens, is critical to the progression of liver fibrosis. The matricellular protein, periostin, resides in ECM but serves as a regulatory molecule for fibrillogenesis by working in concert with lysyl oxidase-like proteins (LOXLs) to promote collagen cross-linking. We have found periostin mRNA and protein are increased in C57BL/6 mice subjected to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) gavage. Conversely, in vivo studies performed in periostin global knockout mice revealed protection against CCl4-induced liver stiffness. Periostin strongly co-localized with alpha smooth muscle actin expression in myofibroblasts in either CCl4-gavaged WT mice, or WT mice subject to BDL. The preliminary data acquired along with published literature provide a firm scientific premise to test the central hypothesis of this proposal: Periostin produced by myofibroblasts (MyoFs) promotes hepatic fibrosis via a novel signaling pathway by direct binding to DDR1, activating Pyk2, and increasing liver stiffness by activation of lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity which together amplify the fibrotic response. This hypothesis will be tested by the following three aims. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Demonstrate that hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary cellular source of periostin during induction of liver fibrosis in vivo, and that subsequently hepatic MyoFs preferentially synthesize and secrete the pro-fibrogenic periostin splice variant periostin 2 containing exon-17. Using HSC-specific Lrat-Cre reporter mice, we will lineage map HSCs to establish the spatiotemporal hepatic source of periostin during liver fibrosis. We have found the splice variant exon-17 containing periostin is uniquely present in MyoFs, but absent in quiescent HSCs. We will isolate both quiescent HSCs and MyoFs by fluorescence-activating cell sorting (FACS) to identify downstream effectors of the profibrogenic effects of periostin by RNA-Seq. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Establish that periostin is a DDR1 ligand which promotes fibrogenesis by triggering a Pyk2-mediated signal transduction pathway. Immunoprecipitation (IP) studies have demonstrated that periostin binds DDR1 in MyoFs and activates DDR1-RTK activity. We will identify the periostin binding site for DDR1 via solid phase binding assay, and by use of His-tagged periostin protein isoforms. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Establish an in vivo mechanism whereby periostin functions independently of TGF?1 as a pro-fibrogenic stimulus through increased LOX expression and activity. Periostin and LOX have been previously thought to be dependent on TGF?1?activity, but preliminary data indicate periostin can directly drive activation of Smad binding element-4 and Smad phosphorylation. Therefore we will determine the direct contribution of periostin following either CCl4gavage or BDL in TGF?1 null mice crossed with Postn+/lacZreporter mice to demonstrate that periostin actions are TGF?1/Rag1 independent."
"9464080","Project Summary  Design of neuromodulatory devices targeting the kidney requires detailed knowledge of the structural and functional neurobiology of renal nerves. Our current understanding is fairly rudimentary and based on classical but outdated methodologies. For example, it is generally agreed that renal efferent nerves increase renin release, stimulate sodium reabsorption, and decrease GFR secondary to arteriolar constriction. However, the dose-response relationships for these effects are based on supramaximal electrical stimulation of renal nerves in anesthetized animals. Recent studies in conscious animals suggest this dogma may be incorrect. Even less is known regarding the structural and functional neurobiology of renal afferent nerves. Although it is well accepted that the renal pelvic wall in densely innervated, preliminary findings in our laboratory, as well as reports by others, suggest sensory nerves may also innervate vascular and tubular targets throughout the kidney. However, the physiological role of renal afferent nerves is unclear. Finally, it is well established that the afferent and efferent innervation of the kidney is heterogeneous. Distinct subsets of sympathetic renal nerves express the neuropeptides NPY and VIP. In the afferent renal innervation there is partial overlap of expression of the neuropeptides CGRP and SP and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1. In addition, our preliminary results demonstrate for the first time the presence of renal afferent nerves that express the sensory neuron-specific voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.8. The functional significance of the neurochemical diversity of renal afferent and efferent nerves represents a critical gap in our understanding of neural control of kidney function.  Our central hypothesis is that efferent and afferent nerves with distinct neurochemical signatures differentially control renal functions through their association with distinct renal structures. We will use state-of- the-art neurophysiological and neuroanatomical approaches to generate an integrated functional and structural map of neural control in the mouse kidney. We will also initiate translation of these finding to the human kidney through comprehensive neuroanatomical analysis. In Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that neurochemically distinct renal nerves differentially control renal function. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that neurochemically distinct renal nerves are associated with distinct structures in the kidney. Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will define the structural neurobiology of renal efferent and afferent nerves, and their relationship to vascular, tubular and renal pelvis anatomy in the human kidney."
"9568086","Abstract This is a renewal application for the Rutgers University CounterACT Research Center of Excellence, which is focused on the discovery and development of drugs to treat poisoning from exposure to vesicants including sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and other mechanistically related chemical threat agents.

"9473300","Project Summary/Abstract Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently suffer from autonomic dysfunction in addition to the neuromuscular ailments that represent their hallmark symptoms, and one of the most common and debilitating of their autonomic problems is constipation. Our theory is that constipation develops as a form of collateral damage from the central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response that occurs in MS. During this inflammatory response, the patient's immune system generates antibodies that target proteins in the cellular debris of dying neurons and glial cells in affected areas, and these autoantibodies could have actions at distant sites. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is unique in that it contains intrinsic reflex circuitry that regulates motility, secretion and vascular tone in the gut, independently of CNS innervation. The ENS contains glial cells that share transcriptome features of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, including proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein. These are two known antigenic targets in MS that could be incidentally targeted where they are also expressed in the ENS. This grant proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that autoantibodies generated in MS patients can target proteins on neuronal and glial membranes in the ENS, resulting in altered enteric neural reflex activity leading to constipation. In support of our hypothesis and the feasibility of our proposed studies, we have demonstrated that GI function is altered in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the predominant mouse model of MS, in ways that are consistent with the development of constipation. Furthermore, we have found that blood samples from MS patients and EAE mice contain antibodies that bind to neurons and glial cells in the GI tract. In our proposed studies, we will examine the features of GI dysfunction in EAE mice, and confirm that the changes in gut motility involve circulating autoantibodies. We will determine the ENS cell types that MS autoantibodies bind to, and what effects these antibodies have on GI function in nave mice. We will also directly examine the physiological activities of glial cells and neurons in the GI tract, and we will elucidate how these activities are altered in EAE mice, and in response to treatment with autoantibodies from MS patients. In these studies, we will also use colons from mice in which a calcium indicator protein is expressed by enteric glial cells or select populations of enteric neurons, and we will use intracellular recording to evaluate the strength of excitatory and inhibitory neuromuscular transmission. Finally, we will test potential therapeutic approaches for their effectiveness in alleviating constipation in the MS mouse model. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for constipation in MS is a clinically relevant goal since it is a critical step toward developing an effective therapeutic solution for the GI ailments of affected MS patients and others with autoimmune-mediated dysmotility."

"9272749","Project Summary One of the more challenging aspects of science education for many public elementary school teachers is the lack of a dedicated science laboratory space. Teachers must conduct science experiments in the same room where they will be teaching literature or math in the very next period. For many teachers this severely limits the kinds of experimentation that can occur in the course. By moving experimentation to a Virtual Science Laboratory space (VSL), teachers will be relieved of these logistical challenges and expand the type of experiments that elementary students are able to conduct. The technology offered through the proposed software platform will put students in control of two virtual hands that allow them to naturally coordinate bimanual movements to execute complex tasks in a virtual 3D space in ways that mirror those same tasks in the real-world. By carrying out experiments with their hands, students will learn by doing, absorbing the material more quickly and at a deeper level. The VSL will be developed and validated in three steps: 1. Implement a Virtual Science Laboratory platform that is capable of expressing elementary school  physical laboratory lessons. The platform will consist of hardware and software components that  support two-handed motion-tracked interaction to let students carry out investigations and  experiments in a natural real-world manner. 2. Build a typical lesson in terms of that platform. The core-based lab assignment will directly target  the performance expectations of fifth graders to demonstrate grade-appropriate proficiency in  planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, using mathematics and  computational thinking, engaging in argument from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and  communicating information. 3. Determine the effect of the VSL lesson in a live classroom setting and analyze the results.  Specifically, the VSL's effectiveness and potential cost savings will be measured by comparing how  it conveys the learning material in two classes -- one using the traditional physical lab and the other  using the VSL. Assessment of content learning will follow the interaction in addition to assessment  of student engagement and enjoyment."

"9465846"," Project Summary Tractions exerted by individual cells on their surroundings play a critical role in mechanical events in biology such as tissue contraction, folding, cell shape changes, or cell movements, and in many basic cellular functions such as biochemical signaling, proliferation, and differentiation. These processes are in turn implicated in the progression of diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, and other chronic fibrotic conditions. Recently, this remarkable link has been utilized to develop exciting new therapeutic interventions that rely on disrupting mechano-signaling machinery within the cell, and the pathways that lead to the remodeling of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Techniques that can precisely quantify the spatial variation and heterogeneity of cellular traction within and between cells have found important applications in understanding and controlling these processes. Of these, three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3D TFM) has emerged as a particularly valuable tool since it is applied to cells embedded in a three-dimensional ECM, the natural state for most cells. Current 3D TFM approaches are challenged by the critical steps of using optical images to generate a 3D geometrical model of the matrix surrounding the cell, and inferring cellular tractions from displacement estimates of micro-beads embedded in the matrix. Approximations incurred in these steps lead to significant errors in computed tractions that in turn lead to erroneous biological conclusions. Thus there is critical need to develop more accurate and high resolution 3D TFM techniques. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to improve and automate the 3D TFM process so that it can be effectively used to answer mechanobiological questions and design new therapeutic interventions. This will be accomplished by (a) applying advanced segmentation and mesh generation techniques to optical images to generate 3D geometric models and finite element meshes of the matrix surrounding a cell, and (b) by developing and implementing new algorithms to determine the spatial distribution of cellular tractions from measured micro-beads displacements, while accounting the nonlinear elastic response of the matrix. These developments will be validated through benchmark studies, and their utility will be demonstrated by quantifying the traction exerted by cancer cells embedded in a synthetic extracellular matrix."

"9428053","ABSTRACT The objective of this application is to investigate glymphatic impairment and cognitive deficits during progression of aging with and without diabetes. Emerging data1-5 indicate that the glymphatic system in the brain mediates the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-interstitial (ISF) exchange and solute clearance from the brain parenchyma. However, despite the well-described dysfunction of the glymphatic system in the development of neurodegenerative conditions, there is still no reported study that focuses on the role of the glymphatic system in the development of cognitive impairment during aging and aging with type-2 diabetes (DM). Using non- invasive MRI methodologies to investigate cerebral solute waste clearance in middle-age control and type-2 diabetic (DM) rats, we have found increased impairment of the glymphatic system, as indicated by reduced clearance of interstitial Gd-DTPA in brain parenchyma, primarily in the hippocampus and hypothalamus in DM rats (Fig.2&3)6. In parallel, 3D confocal microscopic analysis of the brain-wide distribution of fluorescent tracers revealed increased delayed clearance of ISF in the hippocampus and hypothalamus from DM rats (Fig.2&3)6. Impairment of the glymphatic system in DM rats was shown to be highly correlated with cognitive deficits as measured by an array of cognitive tests including the Morris Water Maze (MWM) for hippocampal related learning and memory. Importantly, histopathological analysis shows that delayed clearance of interstitial solutes is associated with sporadic cerebral microvascular thrombosis in the hippocampus 2 months after hyperglycemia (15 months from birth), while extensive microvascular thrombosis and para-vascular accumulation of beta- amyloid (A?) are detected at 4 months after induction of hyperglycemia (17 months from birth), suggesting that the impairment of the glymphatic system leads to A? accumulation. Collectively, our preliminary data, for the first time, demonstrate that non-invasive MRI methodologies can detect DM-induced early impairment of the glymphatic system which is highly correlated with hippocampal related dysfunction of learning and memory. Based on our novel preliminary data, we will employ MRI and 3D confocal microscopy to evaluate and quantitatively measure kinetic clearance parameters of the glymphatic system during progression of aging with and without DM (Aim 1). We will then investigate: whether impairment of the glymphatic system predicts cognitive dysfunction, the sensitivity and association between impairment of the glymphatic system, the onset of brain vascular dysfunction, and cognitive deficits during aging with and without DM (Aim 2). Data generated from this application will provide new insights into aging and age-matched DM associated impairment of the glymphatic system and the relationship of the glymphatic system with vascular and cognitive dysfunction."
"9413565","PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Yiling Lu is a Research Non-Tenure-Track-Professor at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) where she has served as a Core Manager of the CCSG Core of Functional Proteomics by Reverse Phase protein Array (RPPA). The Core is located in the Department of Systems Biology chaired by Dr. Gordon B Mills who acting as the Primary Unit Director in this award application. The RPPA Core provides MDACC investigators, their collaborators and the cancer research community with a powerful high throughput, quantitative, cost-effective technology for functional proteomics studies. The Core has analyzed more than 125,742 samples from 547 cancer researches across from the world over the last 8 years and supported for over 265 publications including high profile journals and more then 10 million dollars of peer-reviewed grant funding from the NCI and other agencies. The most significant evidence for the utility and robustness of the RPPA Core is that its inclusion in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis for each disease type and its participation in over 25 of ?pancan? ?markers? papers in New England Journal of Medicine, Nature, Cell and Science and their clones. In addition to the generation of high quality RPPA data, one of the key aspects of the Core is the provision of functional proteomics data to the community. This is facilitated through the RPPA data being integrated into the cBioportal and being made available for downloading, analysis and visualization through The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA portal). The RPPA contributions to progress in cancer research impact this scientific field around the world. Cancer targeted therapy is designed to capitalize on the vulnerabilities of tumor cells arising from the rewiring of functional networks as a consequence of the genomic and epigenetic changes in tumor or their effects on the tumor environment, impacting cellular protein functions. Thus, direct assessment of the targeted effects, both predicted and unexpected, on the key proteins in signaling networks is required. As clarified in this application, the facility will continue to provide RPPA services to MDACC investigators and the worldwide research community. 1) The facility will continue to expand the validated antibody repertoire to cover varies signaling pathways. 2) The facility will continue to improve the quality and accuracy of RPPA data sets. 3) The facility will continue to work with a contractor to build a RPPA pipeline automation program to decrease turnaround time. 4) The facility will develop the RPPA technology to maximize its applications for clinical usage. 5) The facility will develop single cell analysis through Nanostring technology and add it to functional proteomics service to meet the interests from investigators. To ensure the utility of the RPPA resource, Dr. Lu has multiple active collaborations at MDACC, as well as, nationally and internationally for her scientific activities and career development."
"9341772","Malaria infection led to 584,000 deaths in 2014, and despite disease control efforts; 3.3 billion people remain at risk of infection. These control measures have included both conservative strategies as well as more aggressive approaches. While these methods have made in-roads in managing the global malaria epidemic, there is a great need for sustainable, effective diagnostic tools to help direct elimination campaigns.  One such approach is the test-and-treat elimination strategy. In Zambia, at the local level, test and treat has drastically lowered disease incidence in settings with low malaria transmission. In these efforts, a malaria- positive rapid diagnostic test (RDT) initiates a reactive-case management response. This involves a dated, even by low and middle-income countries standards, communication chain that ultimately results in a community healthcare worker traveling to the home of the index case patient and testing those at risk of infection within a specified proximity. Despite its successes, the slow flow of information and the heavy reliance on a large number of volunteer community healthcare workers result in concerns over scalability and sustainability. As a result, this elimination strategy has failed to gain traction among other countries.  To overcome these critical challenges, we propose an integrated mHealth-based strategy that will streamline the information workflow, provide efficient resource management, and direct evidenced-based decision-making. Our strategy utilizes mobile phone image-processing to quantitatively interpret RDTs and the built-in reporting capabilities characteristic of mobile devices. The accurate POC analysis will immediately benefit the patient by directing them to the appropriate treatment and improve disease surveillance from the field. This near real-time aggregated data will allow national health officials to make informed decisions that result in more targeted interventions. To achieve these goals, we propose: Specific Aim 1. Development of mobile Health and Treat (mHAT) software. Specific Aim 2. Field evaluation of the mHAT reactive case management strategy.  We have assembled a team of malaria researchers from chemistry (Wright), biomedical engineering (Scherr), biomedical informatics (Were), and clinician and field scientists with experience in Zambia (Conrad, Thuma) to address the need for integrated diagnostic tools for malaria elimination. At the individual patient level, we expect our tools will provide patients and community healthcare workers with an accurate and rapid diagnosis; at the community level, we anticipate a more efficient and sustainable strategy. At the national level, outcomes include more effective monitoring and focusing of healthcare specific resources, and the potential for data-driven interventions."
"9444134","Project Summary: Project 5, Analysis and Modeling of Neural Data  Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. Large population recordings, such as those that will be obtained in other components of this proposal, open the door to assessing the dynamics of brain states on a single-trial, moment-by-moment basis. Yet their size and complexity present a challenge, as does the variety of data that will be collected, incorporating anatomy, behavior, neural activity, and perturbations. This project will develop and apply novel statistical analyses and modeling approaches to meet these challenges. The lion?s share of the variance in neural population activity is often dominated by variations in a small number of variables, which are called ?latent variables.? This project will leverage the very large data sets, collected in other components of the project, of many simultaneously recorded neurons to develop advanced linear and nonlinear methods to identify the most informative latent variables. To analyze these datasets, the researchers will develop new latent variable discovery methods. First, they will combine advanced quantitative behavioral analysis with advanced statistical neural analysis. Second, they will combine latent space discovery with ??tting of generalized linear models to neural data. The resulting nonlinear methods will provide an unprecedentedly complete statistical description of the data: these methods aim to simultaneously discover and capture the dynamics of the most important latent variables, and to produce a full statistical characterization of the responses of each individual recorded neuron. In biophysical modeling work, critical to creating a mechanistic understanding at the neural circuit level, this project will develop and test models of both local and multi-brain-region activity during working memory and decision-making. These models will build upon rigorous sensitivity-analysis techniques for identifying the critical network interactions underlying observed behavior. The models will be used both to interpret existing data and to design maximally informative experiments about inter-regional network interactions, and they will provide a principled platform from which to design future experiments that test speci??c hypotheses about function and further constrain the models.

"9493655","Abstract  Immune checkpoint inhibitors like ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD1) are revolutionizing cancer treatment. Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for developing new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no benefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is influenced by multiple variables. The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic basis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrates that response to immune checkpoint blockade is strongly determined by the tumor mutation landscape and dictated by a specific neoantigen repertoire. We will apply a conceptually and technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to elucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our contribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint inhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and immunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive evidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. Should our work succeed, we envision substantial utility for similar studies for other cancers. Such an understanding will provide great insight into the mechanisms underlying how immune checkpoint blockade works, provide much needed precise biomarkers, and establish a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapy."

"9377506","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Perception, cognition, and other high level brain functions are thought to arise in the neocortex, a laminar sheet of neurons forming the surface of the brain. However, the billions of neurons and trillions of synaptic connections in the cortex form an overwhelmingly complex system, and therefore more insight into the organization of the cortex at the local circuit level is needed. Previous research has suggested that ontogenetic columns (columns of clonally-related neurons) play a critical role in excitatory neuron integration in local microcircuitry, and may represent a fundamental module of cortical computation. However, the functional relationships within an ontogenetic column and the principles of ontogenetic column integration into the local circuit of inhibitory interneurons have not been examined.  This project will use multi-photon in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the visual feature selectivity of clonally-related neurons across all layers of primary visual cortex, and examine the distribution of feature selectivity within a layer, and how that distribution changes between cortical layers. Additionally, using octuple simultaneous whole cell patching, this project will test different classes of cortical inhibitory interneurons for patterns of connectivity to ontogenetic columns, in order to gain insight into how clonally related neurons integrate with unrelated neurons in the local circuit. Together, these experiments will delineate the influence of ontogenetic history on the functional organization and microcircuitry of adult neocortex. The results of this work have the potential to reveal fundamental new insights into how the brain processes incoming sensory information, and how that information is transformed as it passes from one cortical layer to another. These results will thus enable a more principled understanding of normal and abnormal circuit function, with broad implications for a wide range of currently intractable neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia."
"9419085","Pilot Research Project 1: A Phase 1b Trial of Oligomeric Procyanidin Complex in Combination with Metformin for Reduced AGE Levels in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy RESEARCH SUMMARY Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are reactive metabolites produced as by-products of sugar metabolism and oxidative stress. An extensive literature links AGEs with the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and other chronic diseases. The U54 investigators have identified preferential accumulation of AGEs in prostate cancer (PCa) serum and tumor, compared with normal serum and prostate tissue. Furthermore, among PCa patients, AGE accumulation is higher in blacks with African ancestry (AAs) than in European Americans (EAs). As AGEs appear to promote cancer survival and growth, interventions to limit their accumulation may be viewed as potential cancer therapeutic agents. These agents may be attractive components of multi-faceted treatment regimens for populations with high prevalence of poor diet, low income, obesity, and lack of exercise. These are all lifestyle factors that are known to increase cancer burden, and are often prevalent in AAs. The study investigators propose to conduct a Phase Ib clinical trial of a combination of two potential agents to reduce AGE levels ? metformin and oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC). Each agent has been shown to reduce AGE levels in some patients with either diabetes mellitus (metformin) or cancer (OPC). Their combination may be more effective than either agent alone. The study will be co-led by Dr. Shanora Brown from South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Dr. Michael Lilly from the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC). As a Phase Ib study, the primary objective will be to define toxicity for the drug combination. However, all analyses will compare results in AA and EA participants. Aim 1 is to conduct a Phase Ib trial of a combination of metformin and OPC in PCa patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This aim will be led by Dr. Lilly (MUSC-HCC). Aim 2 is to perform correlative biochemical studies of inflammation and oxidative stress during the Phase Ib trial. This aim will be led by Dr. Brown (SCSU). No studies to date have investigated AGE effects on PCa treatment. The proposed study provides a novel, unifying mechanism to account for the poorer PCa response to ADT, and the higher PCa incidence, as well as poorer quality of life, in patients with obesity, oxidative stress, and hyperglycemia. This mechanistic model may also mediate cancer racial disparities in PCa outcomes."
"9329274","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many bone fractures show compromised regeneration-healing slowly (delayed union) or failing to heal (non-union). These injuries can be complicated by pain and loss of function, often requiring revision surgery, and are a significant cost to society. A robust vascular response is required for proper bone regeneration, thus a lack of vascularization is a primary risk factor for compromised bone healing. Therefore, methodologies that enhance vascularization will promote greater healing of compromised fractures. Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and its closest family member thrombospondin 2 (TSP2) are extracellular matrix proteins and potent endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis that are over-expressed in non-healing wounds. TSP1 and TSP2 are highly expressed during the fibrovascular phase of compromised fracture healing and an absence of TSP2 results in enhanced vascularization and bone formation during ischemic fracture healing. A dominant mechanism for the influence of TSPs on revascularization in tissues is the interaction of these ligands with the CD47 receptor, a pleiotropic receptor that strongly influences ischemia-reperfusion. However, the significance of TSP-CD47 interactions in enhancing ischemic fracture healing has not been studied. We hypothesize that TSPs are endogenous inhibitors of ischemic fracture healing by binding to CD47. Blocking TSP-CD47 binding will promote fracture vascularization and enhance bone regeneration in compromised fracture healing. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims. First we will examine the contribution of TSP1 and TSP2 to ischemic fracture healing by studying TSP1-null, TSP2-null, and double-knockout mice. As well, we will add back TSP2 using adenovirus. In Aim 2, we will ask whether CD47 regulates fracture vascularization and bone regeneration in compromised fracture healing by binding to TSP. We will examine ischemic fracture healing in CD47-null mice, and then evaluate whether a TSP1-based CD47 activating peptide inhibits ischemic fracture revascularization. Finally, we will ask whether disruption of TSP-CD47 ligand-receptor interaction following fracture healing using CD47 blocking agents, delivered either locally or systemically, can enhances fracture vascularization and bone regeneration in compromised healing.  Successful completion of these studies could have significant near-term clinical implications for the patient with a compromised fracture."
"9418806","ABSTRACT ? Research Pilot Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide, yet there are pronounced differences in incidence and mortality between racial/ethnic groups. Hispanics/Latinas (H/L) are a growing and understudied group characterized by a variable admixture of European, Indigenous American, and African ancestry. Breast cancer is genetically and biologically heterogeneous, consisting of multiple molecular subtypes which differ in terms of prognosis and response to treatment. The PAM50 gene expression panel distinguishes five main intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer: Luminal A, Luminal B (both ER?-positive), Her2/Neu enriched, Basal-like and Normal-like. The Luminal B subtype has a poorer prognosis than Luminal A, lower expression of nuclear hormone receptors, and higher expression of proliferation markers. These tumors benefit less from endocrine therapy, and remain the largest cause of breast cancer mortality. In a cohort of 301 clinically annotated H/L breast cancer patients, we found that among mixed-ancestry Hispanic/Latina patients, the frequency of Luminal B tumors is remarkably high (>42%). Among these H/L patients, Luminal B tumors are characterized by a more aggressive clinical presentation than Luminal A tumors, suggesting that the high frequency of Luminal B tumors is associated with a strong health outcomes disparity. A higher incidence of Luminal B tumors has been reported among US H/L patients, but the number of H/L in the study was too small to draw definite conclusions. Using RNASeq, we found that H/L Luminal B tumors are frequently characterized by increased expression of the ERBB2 (Her2/Neu) receptor, the GRB7 adaptor and the migration and invasion enhancer, MIEN1. Expression of these three genes was linked to Indigenous American (IA) ancestry and all are located at Ch17q12. ERBB2 and GRB7 are co-amplified in Her2/Neu enriched tumors, and are correlated with endocrine resistance and poor prognosis in ER?-positive tumors. A link between genetic ancestry and Luminal B breast cancer can help identify prognostic biomarkers as well as molecular features for specific therapeutic approaches (precision medicine) in H/L. Our primary hypothesis is that H/L ethnicity/IA ancestry are associated with a high incidence of Luminal B tumors and with increased expression of ERBB2, GRB7 and MIEN1. Furthermore, we propose that the elevated expression of these three genes may be the consequence of altered promoter or enhancer methylation linked to IA ancestry. To test these ideas, we will examine a novel cohort of H/L breast cancer patients in two specific aims: (1) to determine the molecular portraits of PAM50- confirmed Luminal B tumors from H/L breast cancer patients utilizing RNASeq, and to correlate these findings with clinicopathological parameters and outcomes, and (2) to establish the relationship of ERBB2, GRB7 and MIEN1 with promoter methylation, ancestry, clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes."
"9370391","PROJECT SUMMARY  Gout is a common and excruciatingly painful inflammatory arthritis associated with hyperuricemia. The  prevalence of gout has increased over the past few decades to 3.9% of US adults (8.3 million individuals),  which is further complicated by a high level of comorbidities (CoRT theme, including chronic kidney disease  (CKD)) and their sequelae (e.g., premature death). Despite our understanding of gout's pathogenesis and  available medications, gout management remains suboptimal with recurrent attacks occurring frequently, and  there is a clear need to broaden the evidence-based and personalized precision approach to gout care. Our  previous Boston Online Gout Study successfully provided the relevant evidence about the role of traditionally  purported risk factors for gout flares in pre-existing gout patients, which was endorsed by the latest ACR gout  guidelines. However, evidence for purported novel common modifiable risk factors as well as genetic and  other key attributes, which are essential for precision gout care, are lacking. To fill this key evidence  gap, we will expand our successful platform of the Boston Online Gout Study by following 800 gout patients  from the Partners Biobank cohort (N >75,000) and 200 black gout patients from the UAB Rheumatology Arthritis  Database and Registry over the course of 1 year. We will first examine novel common modifiable factors (i.e.,  sugar-sweetened beverages, coffee, and tea) for the risk of gout flares (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will translate  recent genomic research data towards precision medicine in gout care for both lifestyle and  pharmacologic interventions. Specifically, we will examine the purported influence of urate genes involved in  sugar transport (SLC2A9) and metabolism genes (GCKR, IGF1R, and INHBB) on the impact of key risk factors  for gout flares (Aim 2). We will also examine the purported impact of the ABCG2 variant (Q141K) and PRKAG2  variant (which encodes the gamma chain of AMPK (a master regulator of gouty inflammation)) on allopurinol's  clinical efficacy for gout flares, as well as the purported role of the SLC2A9 variant on diuretic-induced gout  flares (Aim 3). Finally, we will examine the role of other key attributes (i.e., race (black) and CKD status  (stage 3 or higher)) on the impact of key triggers of gout flares among gout patients to further precision gout care  (Aim 4). These aims address novel, common risk factors, gene-environmental interactions,  pharmacogenomics, and race/CKD impact, all of which can be readily translated into clinical practice to  optimize gout care. Further, the innovative and cost-effective study design leverages our group's extensive  gout research experience and provides key research translation for precision medicine in gout. This project  will have an important positive impact on millions of gout patients by filling key evidence gaps on modifiable  factors and relevant subgroups at risk for gout flares."
"9462254","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hepcidin is the peptide hormone responsible for regulating circulating iron concentrations. Overexpression of hepcidin results in severe iron deficiency and anemia, whereas hepcidin deficiency leads to iron overload. Not surprisingly, abnormalities in hepcidin production and circulating concentrations are highly correlated with various disease states such as renal disease, cancer, hereditary hemochromatosis, hypoxia, anemia of inflammation, infection, inflammatory diseases, and heart disease. Accurate methods for detecting hepcidin in serum will lead to improvements in our understanding, diagnosis, and clinical management of iron metabolism disorders. Unfortunately, there is no FDA-approved assay for measuring hepcidin levels in plasma. The development of a clinically relevant hepcidin assay has been hindered by hepcidin?s very low immunogenicity, making it extremely challenging to produce antibodies against the hormone. The few immunoassays that do exist are poorly characterized in terms of specificity, and they struggle to differentiate hepcidin from the multiple inactive forms of the hormone that are found in the circulation. Affinergy plans to develop a phage-based clinical chemistry assay that will enable frequent, simple, and affordable monitoring of plasma hepcidin-25 levels. Using our core technology of phage display biopanning, we have already identified a proprietary ?capture? peptide that binds to hepcidin-25. In this Phase 1 application, we intend to identify a hepcidin-25 specific ?detection? phage and incorporate the hepcidin-25-binding peptide and phage in a rapid, easy-to-use sandwich ELISA-based assay. At the conclusion of Phase 1, we expect to have a technology that can be scaled up in Phase 2 for use by clinicians and researchers to measure hepcidin concentrations in plasma."
"9377020","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Numbers of individuals living with cancer are fast growing, reaching 19 million by 2024. More than 50% of cancer survivors live with multiple concurrent symptoms after treatment completion. There is immediate need for effective strategies that can manage multiple symptoms simultaneously. Linkages between circadian aberrations and cancer-associated symptoms are supported by the current literature and our preliminary data. Therapeutic bright light has shown effectiveness in treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders and alleviating various symptoms associated with circadian aberrations. Although previous trials have shown that morning bright light prevented fatigue and quality of life from worsening during and after chemotherapy, those observed effects may have been compromised because individual differences in circadian patterns were not considered. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a personalized bright light intervention and to estimate the effects of bright light on 4 common long-term or late effects of cancer (sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, and cognitive dysfunction) and on quality of life in post-treatment survivors of breast cancer. To test our hypothesized mechanism, effects of bright light on circadian rhythms will also be examined. The long term goal is to identify the therapeutic effect of bright light and to develop effective interventions to attenuate multiple symptoms associated with cancer that are feasible for patient self- management. The specific aims are: 1) To assess the feasibility of implementing a home-based, personalized bright light intervention and the proposed data collection plan; 2) To estimate the effect of bright light on sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, cognition, and quality of life, and 3) on circadian rhythms, in survivors of breast cancer. This randomized, controlled pilot study will recruit 34 female survivors with Stage I-III breast cancer. The participants will be randomized to either 30-minute blue-green light therapy at 12,000 lux or dim red light control at 5 lux. Light will be self-administered using a light visor cap at home for 14 consecutive days. Tailored to the individual's circadian pattern, light will be delivered either within 30 minutes of waking in the morning or between 1900-2000 hours in the evening. The nocturnal sleep patterns will be monitored by all- night in-lab polysomnography; sleep quality, fatigue, depression, and quality of life will be self-reported; cognition will be objectively assessed before and after the intervention. Circadian rhythm will be indexed by nocturnal core body temperature before and after the intervention. Feasibility will be determined by the proportion of contacted, recruited, and retained subjects, and completeness of the data collected. Subjective feedback and burden will be assessed at study exit."
"9280605","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Persistent viral infections (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis B & C) represent a significant source of morbidity  and mortality with over 500 million persons infected worldwide. The underlying mechanisms that promote persistent viral infection remain incompletely understood. We use a mouse model of viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to define fundamental virus-host interactions that can tip the balance toward resolution and clearance of persistent infection.  The  site-1 Protease (S1P) is a host protein required late in the arenavirus life cycle to produce infectious LCMV and other hemorrhagic arenaviruses that cause rapid fatality after aerosol contact. We generated mice conditionally deficient for S1P in targeted cell types to define the role of productive viral infection in antigen presenting cells (APC) during persistent viral infection. Using this approach, we identified dendritic cells (DC) as key cell types where productive viral replication is required for persistent systemic infection. This observation highlights a potential Achilles' heel for persistent viral infection where one may target only a single specific cell type to eliminate overall persistent viral infection.  Overall Hypothesis: We propose that persistent viral infections specifically engage APC and subvert their function to persist-effectively turning the host's immune sentinels into viral factories that exhaust rather than activate the antiviral T cell response. A corollary to this hypothesis is that by blocking the  viral life cycle in DC we can activate DC (Aim 1) to drive the otherwise exhausted LCMV-specific T cell response in vivo (Aim 2). Obtaining this knowledge will increase our understanding of persistent infections and how to treat them. We will delete genetically delete S1P in DC to determine its function during chronic viral infection. More specifically, we will determine the rol of host S1P in generating fully processed LCMV glycoprotein and subsequently infectious arenavirus from DC. We will be able to do this efficiently and in vivo by using recombinant virus with a complementing mutation in its glycoprotein cleavage site. This complementing mutation will allow growth of the recombinant virus in S1P deficient cells.  Our Specific Aims will identify  cell-specific molecular mechanism. We will determine the effector molecules modulated in an S1P-dependent fashion during viral infections and subsequently demonstrate their relative sufficiency in conferring susceptibility or resistance to infection via altering APC-T cell interactions. We propose to mechanistically delineate how a viral protein (e.g. GPC) inhibits the host response at a molecular level. This information is significant for potential application to modify inappropriate immune responses in patients.  In summary, this application not only addresses a basic biological question of why viral infections persist, it also outlines a significat translational strategy for controlling or eliminating persistent viral infection by specific modification of APC. By delineating mechanism, the fruits of these studies may be used to modify immune responses in patients undergoing infectious and/or immune-mediated diseases."

We provide the necessary reagents and expertise to mouse geneticists who do not normally work with the kidney to facilitate and encourage their move into this field. We encourage investigator who do not normally use mouse models, including and especially clinical investigators, to venture into the mouse system and to ease this transition. We will also assist the generation of non-genetic models of acute and chronic kidney disease to assist investigators in their studies. We will accomplish our objectives in several ways. First, the core has generated and will distribute many kidney-specific conditional (inducible activator and repressor lines), glomerular or tubule segment-specific Cre recombinase lines to be crossed to floxed or tet responder lines of interest to the investigator. We will provide advice as well as the actual mousselines. Second, core personnel will assist in the generation of additional transgenic mice, knockout/in mice and cell lines as required by co-investigators. We will either offer advice or if the demand is high, we plan to add a new line t our Core once a year. Finally, core personnel will perform for or train investigators in the use of various models of organ injury/repair as well as ex vivo culture. We will always have exploratory modules where we participate in the cutting edge of technologies in renal research. We have developed technologies for 4-D live imaging of kidneys, metabolite labeling and quantification in organ culture, metabolomics in organ culture, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome engineering, isolation, expansion and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells. The ultimate purpose of this core is to facilitate research on kidney development, genetics, physiology and pathophysiology."
"9398911","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is estimated to have occurred in 10 to 23% of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) combatants, resulting in cognitive, neurobehavioral, and emotional sequelae and disability. Diagnosis in the chronic phase is difficult because conventional brain imaging is insensitive, acute injury records may be unavailable, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often overlap with those of TBI. Advanced brain imaging of TBI could potentially identify disruption of white matter (WM) tracts on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), alterations in brain activation while performing cognitive tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and changes in functional connectivity (FC) measured from resting state fMRI. Rationale: We reported that TBI indexed by DTI was related to increases in brain activation in Veterans while they performed a spatial conflict resolution (SPCR) task, a finding that we and others have attributed to increased demand upon neural resources due to WM injury. PTSD symptom severity had the opposite effect of reducing task-related brain activation. Limitations of this study included restriction to blast TBI, lack of a definitive diagnostic instrument for PTSD, and the possibility that our findings were specific to the SPCR task. We also did not evaluate resting state FC. Objectives: Study blast and non-blast mechanisms of mild TBI (mTBI), add an fMRI task of complex attention that is likely to be more sensitive to diffuse WM injury, measure FC of the default mode network (DMN), explore the effects of blast exposure in Veterans without a history of mTBI, and perform a comprehensive analysis to examine multi-modality brain imaging in relation to outcome measures. This project will determine relationships between WM tract injury (DTI), fMRI brain activation during SPCR and attention tasks, connectivity during resting state fMRI, and functional, emotional, and cognitive status in mTBI and non-TBI groups. Methods: Study SPCR and complex attention-related brain activation in 60 mTBI (e 3 months post-injury) and 60 non-TBI without blast exposure, as well as 20 Veterans and Service Members with a history of blast exposure but not TBI. DTI will measure WM integrity and resting state fMRI will provide a measure of FC. We will assess cognitive, emotional, and functional outcome to address the Aims and the Clinician Assisted PTSD Scale will be used to identify subjects with PTSD. Statistical analyses will integrate the multimodality brain imaging to evaluate the contributions of mTBI and PTSD to brain activation on the SPCR and attention tasks, as well as FC. The array of brain imaging variables will be analyzed in relation to cognitive, emotional, and functional outcome. Relevance to Veterans' Healthcare: Improved diagnosis of chronic mTBI, including effects of blast exposure without a history of TBI, would facilitate treatment planning and lead to earlier referral. Information about mechanisms may also suggest intervention approaches for TBI and PTSD and provide methods for assessing treatment response."
"9395612","Project Summary/Abstract  The transformative impact of catalytic cross-coupling methods on the assembly of organic molecules cannot be overstated, as evidenced by their widespread adoption for the synthesis of both pharamecuticals and small molecule products. A recently developed paradigm-shifting cross-coupling method that employs both photoredox and base-metal catalytic cycles working in concert has enabled the formation of carbon-carbon bonds that were inaccessible via traditional cross-couplings. These dual catalytic reactions proceed under exceedingly mild conditions (room temperature and near-neutral pH) and with excellent functional group tolerance, enabling the cross-coupling of various prefunctionalized alkyl and aryl halide partners. The goal of the proposed research is to utilize a photocatalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process for the selective activation of alkyl C?H bonds at room temperature and their subsequent functionalization within a base-metal catalyzed cross-coupling cycle. Intra- and intermolecular HAT cycles will be explored, enabling both the directed functionalization of unactivated C?H bonds as well as the utilization of inexpensive commodity chemicals as coupling partners. The use of polarity reversal catalysts will further increase the diversity of C?H bonds that can be functionalized within this dual catalytic cross-coupling manifold. The ability to engage ubiquitous alkyl C?H bonds in cross-couplings will allow for the rapid and streamlined assembly of complex molecules under mild conditions from a virtually limitless pool of alkyl precursors, while simultaneously minimizing waste and improving the sustainability of the process."
"9393045","Modern health monitoring devices at hospitals and wearable sensors in households generate a large amount of time series data at high rate, capturing the physiological status of patients in a real-lime fashion. The premise is that these technology advances enable a data-driven healthcare system that starts making fast, accurate, objective and inexpensive decisions based upon data, in addition to an individual physician's experience and preference. However, there is a significant gap in the mathematical theory and computational tools to promptly extract actionable information from multi-modal non-stationary time series data in a robust and tractable manner, which has become a serious roadblock to further utilize bigger data for better healthcare monitoring. The goal of this research program is to develop a mathematical framework for extracting time-frequency and geometric representations of multi-modal physiological data, in an online and robust manner, and use them to design machine learning algorithms to improve real-lime health monitoring. Specifically, we hypothesize that the development of time-series and geometric methods for large streaming multi-modal monitoring data will lead to more accurate diagnosis on various physiological monitoring applications, including detection and prediction of rare events such as seizure and arrhythmia, classification of sleep stages for newborns and children, and real-time artifact removal of physiological data. To achieve our goal, we plan to develop novel theoretical and computational tools for analyzing non-stationary multi-modal time series data with noise, corruption and missing data as well as real-time algorithms for filtering and event detection from such data. The tools and algorithms will be applied on clinical tasks at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. In addition, the real-time workflow will be implemented on Hadoop clusters with a mission of public sharing of both data and software. The development from the interdisciplinary team composed of mathematicians, biomedical informaticians as well as the hospital will not only transform the frontiers of mathematics knowledge, but also significantly impact clinical applications, data science education, and the development of the $11 O billion emerging market of wireless health."
"9273890","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory process caused by bacterial infection of the bone. The infection is generally limited to a local area of bone and surrounding soft tissue resulting from bacterial contamination following musculoskeletal injury. Treatment of bone infections can be difficult due to poor penetration of antibiotics into the infected tissue owing to the physiologica and anatomical characteristics of bone, the increased prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens, and the protective properties of biofilms formed by the infecting bacteria. Extremity injuries are the most common injuries associated with infection complications in the battlefield. Approximately 15% of these patients develop osteomyelitis, and of those, ~17% suffer from infection relapse or recurrence. An increasing number of active duty personnel are receiving their care at VA facilities and a significant proportion of these patients suffer from musculoskeletal infections. With the increasing prevalence of pathogens resistant to antibiotics, treatment of infections has become more challenging. Current standard treatments for infected bones require adequate debridement of the involved or exposed bone with systemic administration of antibiotics, which can last for weeks and have potential toxicities. Despite current infection intervention strategies implemented to treat combat-related injuries in soldiers, one- third of such injuries have been complicated by infection. The direct medical costs relating to the treatment of osteomyelitis has previously been found to be approximately $35,000 per patient. Our lab has challenged the current paradigm that bone infections require long durations of systemic antibiotics. We have developed a model for local intramedullary delivery of antibiotics into long bones. Our delivery system allows for the repeated dosing of antibiotic to an infected rat tibia model. We have shown that local delivery of antibiotic can result in high therapeutic levels of drug locally while maintaining low systemic levels. Using this model, we will test whether local antibiotic delivery results in improved resolution of infection in a rat tibial osteomyelitis model while maintaining bone integrity and reducing systemic drug concentrations and resultant toxicities compared to traditional systemic delivery. Additionally, we will evaluate this local delivery method in the setting of a contaminated fracture model to determine whether local antibiotic delivery can prevent infection and allow for fracture healing compared to controls Outcomes will be evaluated by radiographic resolution of infection, bioluminescent resolution of infection, bone culture and histology. We expect that local antibiotic delivery will result in fastr and more effective resolution of osteomyelitis and will prevent the development of infection in the contaminated fracture model, without the untoward effects of lengthy systemic antibiotic therapy. The results of this study will allow us to translate this technique to clinical practice ad offer patients that suffer from osteomyelitis or contaminated fractures as the result of combat or non-combat trauma a chance at improved recovery and easier re-integration into society and normal activities."
"9446241","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain is a ubiquitous problem and growing concern for the Military Health System (MHS). Low back pain (LBP) is the most common condition that leads to chronic pain. Numerous recommendations have been made to improve care for LBP and chronic pain in the MHS, including implementation of a Stepped Care approach. Stepped Care is a treatment process that begins with broadly accessible, less intesive interventions that can benefit many patients. Those who do not respond to initial treatments are stepped up to more intesive treatment. While Stepped Care is advocated for pain management, and has been beneficial for improving care in other chronic conditions, many questions remain about which treatments to use within each Step, and the importance of sequences of care decisions. The SMART Stepped Care Management Project will support an innovative Sequential Multiple Randomization Trial specifically designed to address these key questions. The Project brings together a team of researchers and clinicians from the MHS and Department of Defense along with a strong research team at the Unversity of Utah with expertise in the planning of multi-site clinical trials, managing and analyzing research data, and facilitating the dissemination of the results. After a Planning Phase to finalize procedures, the SMART trial will be conducted. Patients in the MHS with chronic LBP will be randomly assigned to either receive Physical Therapy or the holistic Move to Health intervention. After 6 weeks we will determine patients' responsiveness to their first treatment Step. Non-responders will be re-randomized to receive either a mindfulness-oriented treatment program or treatment from an Integrative Pain Medicine Center. Specific Aims for the SMART trial are 1) Conduct a SMART trial comparing effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Step 1 and 2 treatments in a Stepped Care approach for patients with LBP in the MHS with patient-centered and healthcare cost outcomes. Sub-aims will compare main effects of Step 1 and 2 treatment options and the sequencing effects of different treatment combinations; and 2) Examine SMART trial results in pre-specified sub-groups based on sex/gender, age, and pain-related co-morbidities (PTSD, sleep disturbance, post-concussive symptoms)."
"9420061","PROJECT SUMMARY DESCRIPTION: Dementia, especially Alzheimer's dementia (AD), is a growing public health problem with a prevalence of 5M in the US alone (33M worldwide). Despite a decrease in incidence rates, with the aging of the population, the prevalence of dementia is expected to increase to 16M in the US (115M worldwide) with associated costs rising to $1T. Delaying long-term care by 1 month for older Americans would save $60B annually in direct care cost. Efforts to prevent or delay dementia have been largely unsuccessful. However, major depressive disorder in late life (?late-life depression?, LLD) has been identified as one of six treatable risk factors for dementia, especially AD and vascular dementia. The depression-dementia relationship may be magnified in elders who do not respond to antidepressant treatment and experience persistent symptoms. Thus, resolving whether those with treatment-resistant late-life depression (TRLLD) are at higher risk of cognitive decline and progression to dementia compared to those with treatment-responsive LLD is critically important. Leveraging a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded treatment study of N=1500 people with LLD, across 5 sites, we propose to comprehensively delineate neurocognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers associated with progression to dementia in people with persistent LLD (i.e., TRLLD) compared to those whose LLD remits with treatment. We anticipate enrolling 750 elders with LLD and characterizing their symptomatic trajectory over 24 months. We will assess each participant at three time points with neurocognitive and advanced neuroimaging. We hypothesize that changes in executive functions and the executive control network, as well as changes in episodic memory and the default mode/cortico-limbic network, will be greater in those with TRLLD than in those who respond to treatment and stay well. We also hypothesize that changes over two years in executive function and episodic memory will be specifically associated with changes in executive- control and cortico-limbic circuitry, respectively. Based on our recent findings that inflammatory and related molecular markers can differentiate those with neurocognitive impairment and LLD from those with LLD alone, we will build a predictive multivariate model combining baseline neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and plasma protein data to determine who is at greatest risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Finally, we will also explore whether latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms can go beyond the dichotomy of remission/non-remission to identify subsets of elders with LLD at highest risk of cognitive decline, neural circuit change, and progression to dementia. This work will set the stage for neural circuit- targeted preventive care to delay dementia in subsets of older patients with LLD. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting the depression- dementia pathway and reduce suffering for large numbers of elders and their families."

"9560116","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goals of the Cancer Cell Biology Program are: (i) to understand, at the molecular and cellular levels, mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic treatment, and (ii) to identify and validate new targets for cancer therapy. Insight derived from these studies, when integrated with research and development from other programs, will provide targets and guidance for the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer. Toward these two goals, the Program faculty investigates various aspects of cancer cell biology, including growth factors and receptors; angiogenesis and vascular biology; apoptosis; cell cycle regulation; chromatin biochemistry and transcriptional regulation; cell microstructure and function; DNA replication and repair; metabolism; regulatory RNA; and signal transduction. Led by two co-leaders with complementary expertise, Yue Xiong and James Bear, the program organizes these different areas into four major research themes: (1) Cell Cycle, (2) Cell Signaling, (3) Cell Movement and Organization, and (4) Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology. The major emphasis of the Program is to foster integrated research that spans these inter-related themes, enhancing the research and translational capabilities of program investigators through the establishment, expansion and utilization of appropriate core facilities, and promoting interactions with investigators from other LCCC basic, clinical and population sciences programs.         The Cancer Cell Biology Program consists of 45 members who are associated with 7 basic science and 4 clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill. During the last funding period, program members have published 644 cancer-related articles (30% collaborative).

"9438075","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In 2016, an estimated 250,000 new cases of female breast cancer were diagnosed in the U.S., causing an estimated 40,000 deaths. Almost all breast cancer deaths are due to tumor progressive resistance to systemic therapies, followed by metastasis. Anticipating breast cancer chemoresistance is a significant clinical challenge because the changes in commonly monitored parameters, including tumor volume or glucose-analog uptake, have been shown to be poor predictors of resistance and often manifest only after resistance has occurred. The ability to accurately predict the onset of chemoresistance would allow physicians to make evidence based treatment changes in a timely manner, which could substantially improve patient outcomes. New preclinical imaging techniques designed to track resistance over the appropriate spatial and temporal scales could provide key insights into the effective management of chemoresistance in the clinic. The goal of the F99 phase is to develop a novel imaging technique called Diffuse and Nonlinear Imaging (DNI) that combines two different contrast mechanisms over spatial scales ranging from cm to ?m to monitor resistance in vivo. DNI utilizes multiply scattered photons for widefield mapping of tumor metabolism, and multiphoton interactions to achieve molecular, structural, and metabolic tumor imaging with cellular resolution in 3D. These techniques will be combined to make an integrated preclinical imaging system that is co-registered, providing unprecedented evaluation of tumor heterogeneity over a range of spatial scales and contrast mechanisms. DNI will integrate exogenous and molecularly targeted imaging agents with endogenous sources of imaging contrast to obtain a more complete picture of the in vivo tumor state. The first aim is to co-register nonlinear sectioning of vascular organization with oxygenation maps from diffuse imaging of preclinical mammary tumors through a window chamber. The second aim is to identify optical signatures of chemoresistance via DNI monitoring of treated preclinical mammary tumors. Lastly, the third aim is to link optical resistance metrics to heterogeneity in tumor vascular organization. The goal of the K00 phase is to study how the scheduling and spatial distribution of treatment affect the time-to- resistance. This entails tracking distinct clonal populations, and their complex dynamics and competition during drug-tumor interactions. Genetic and phenotypic markers of resistance and heterogeneity will be labeled with engineered nano-optical probes. These will enable longitudinal and simultaneous multiplexing and imaging of complex clonal interactions, and capturing of individual clonal dynamics in vivo in preclinical and clinical tumors. An optical technique will then be developed to use photorelease technology to control spatiotemporal treatment parameters and track drug distribution among clonal nests to study the effects of drug-tumor interactions on long-term resistance. Engineering an all-in-one investigative optical oncology platform that uses light to control treatment, map drug distribution, and image the resulting effects with various contrast mechanisms across different spatial and time scales, will provide novel insights into the effective treatment of resistant tumors."

These studies are critically important as IF are major elements of the cytoskeletal system of mammalian cells and yet their specific functions in cell motility remain unknown. The 6 Project Leaders, and their research aims are as follows: R. Goldman, Northwestern University, will determine how the vimentin IF (VIF) system changes in response to mechanical and chemical signals, and will purify and characterize the vimentin precursors that form as VIF assemble and disassemble. V. Gelfand, Northwestern University will determine the relationship between VIF with microtubules and actin filaments, identify the molecular motors responsible for translocating VIF precursors, and investigate how VIF affect cytoskeletal dynamics and microtubule (MT) dynamics. G. Danuser, Harvard University, will test the hypotheses that VIF network formation involves a spatially distributed assembly line, that this process involves molecular motors, and that VIF network assembly modulates assembly of MT and microfilaments (MF). D. Weitz, Harvard University, will determine the micromechanical properties of in vitro assembled VIF networks prepared from purified vimentin, native VIF networks isolated from cells and in living cells. P. Janmey, University of Pennsylvania, will determine how the VIF network contributes to the micromechanical properties of living cells and how this changes in response to substrate stiffness and external forces. P. Burkhard, University of Connecticut, will use biophysical techniques and X-ray crystallography to determine the structure and biophysical properties of the vimentin dimer and study the formation of VIF assembly intermediates. In all of these studies, the regulatory function of different posttranslational phosphorylation events will be examined."
"9425032","Project Summary/Abstract: Precise control of synaptic development and connectivity is essential for normal brain functions. Defects in synaptic transmissions lead to the disruption of neuronal circuits, which are the underlying cause of various neuropsychiatric diseases. To understand the in vivo functions of key synaptic regulatory proteins, we have conducted studies on a new mouse model for 14-3-3, which is a family of brain-rich proteins implicated in synaptic functions and genetically linked to schizophrenia. We found that inhibition of 14-3-3 functions in the mouse brain impairs synaptic transmission, and causes a variety of behavioral deficits that correspond to the core endophenotypes of established schizophrenia mouse models. We further identified the NMDA receptor as one of the potential targets of 14-3-3 signaling at excitatory synapses in forebrain neurons. These findings are exciting and suggest that mouse models of 14-3-3 dysfunction may provide unique tools to elucidate synaptic mechanisms underlying the development of schizophrenia-associated behaviors. In this proposal, we will 1) develop more precise animal models to define the brain regional- and developmental- specific contributions of 14-3-3 dysfunctions to behavioral deficits; 2) determine the impact of 14-3-3 dysfunctions on neuronal excitability, synaptic physiology and synchronized network activity in the mouse brain; and 3) delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying 14-3-3-dependent regulation of synaptic NMDA receptors. This research encompasses expertise, strength and existing resources in our three laboratories. Results from this study will significantly advance our understanding on the synaptic functions of 14-3-3 proteins and their role in mental disorders."

"9404235","ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma."
"9560987","Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center  Chemistry and Cancer Scientific Program  Project Summary/Abstract  The Chemistry and Cancer (CC) Program combines the expertise of synthetic and medicinal chemists,  molecular biologists, biochemists, structural biologists, and clinician scientists to discover, design, and optimize  drug-like small molecules that regulate biological pathways deregulated in cancer. There are a total of 16  members who are drawn from 4 departments on campus. CC's discovery process takes a two-pronged  approach, starting from a chemistry-to-biology or a biology-to-chemistry direction. For the chemistry-to-biology  approach, the discovery process starts with identifying natural or unnatural small molecules that are selectively  cytotoxic to human cancer cell lines, followed by a rigorous target identification program. During this ?discovery  biology? phase, chemists design specific derivatives to aid in biochemical pull-down and cross-linking studies.  Or, if specific drug-resistant clones against the small molecule of interest can be generated, genetic and  molecular biological studies can provide additional approaches to identify target pathways and/or drug  resistance mechanisms. This unbiased approach is expected to identify novel cancer-specific pathways that  can be chemically interrogated/regulated for proof-of-concept, early drug-discovery efforts. In the biology-to-  chemistry approach, hypotheses regarding the ?drugability? and cancer relevance of specific biological  pathways investigated by Simmons Cancer Center scientists can be tested with small-molecule agonists or  antagonists.  The CC Scientific Program will continue broadly with the following themes:   Theme 1. Identifying the molecular targets of cancer cell?specific small-molecule toxins;   Theme 2. Biochemical dissection of novel, cancer cell?specific pathways;   Theme 3. Proof-of-concept preclinical development of cancer cell?specific small-molecule toxins; and   Theme 4. Dissection, regulation, and targeting of the hypoxia response pathway.  Current peer-reviewed funding for the CC Program is highlighted by $1.5 million from the NCI and $2.8 million  from Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas for total peer-reviewed funding of $7.1 million. CC  Program members have authored 103 peer-reviewed publications since 2009, of which 19% were intra-  programmatic and 30% inter-programmatic, and 15% of them inter-institutional with investigators from other  NCI-designated cancer centers."
"9438293","Recent evidence has showed that the tumor microenvironment (TME) may form a sanctuary for immune suppression and evasion. Although Immunotherapies based on checkpoint inhibitors and chemical modulation of the TME have garnered success, many challenges remain, including the heterogeneity of patient response and the serious side effects resulting from systemic autoimmunity. These observations suggested that biochemical stimuli are not the only factor that suppresses T cell functions within the TME. One emerging concept in the field is that the physical properties of the TME such as extracellular matrix stiffness, composition, and architecture also contributes to cancer cell proliferation and survival. However, whether the mechanical properties of the TME specifically modulates T cell activity, and thus contributing to immune evasion, remains unclear. There are two overarching goals for this proposal. First, to better understand the role of mechanical forces in T cell receptor activation, and T cell functional responses. Second, to understand how the physical aspects of TME affect T cell/tumor interactions and T cell function.  My PhD work is focused on developing enabling technologies to study mechanobiology at the molecular scale, with a particular focus on the roles of mechanical forces in T cell activation. My work has shown that i) the T cell receptor transmits pN forces to its antigen during initial recognition, and in immunological synapse and ii) T cells use mechanical energy to discriminate antigens during the earliest step of T cell activation. For my remaining F99 phase, I will focus on investigating whether mechanical forces are important for T cell function. To achieve this goal, I will use recently developed proximity labeling technologies to identify mechanosensitive proteins that mediate T cell signaling. This strategy will allow for using proteomic analysis to determine the mechanical interactome (mechanome) in T cells. Then, I will determine whether mechanical forces affect long term T cell biological functions using ELISA and flow cytometry coupled with RNA-SEQ. Overall, the results from this integrative -omics study will offer better understanding of how T cells use mechanical energy to potentiate their biological functions.  For my postdoc studies (K00 phase), I aim to understand how the physical aspects of TME affect cytotoxic T cell function (cancer killing). The goal is to quantify how ECM mechanics alter T cell function. This data will support the hypothesis that TME contributes to metastasis by enhancing immune evasion through physical mechanisms. The significance of this work pertains to developing new strategies for promoting T cell anti-tumor response. I propose to work in a lab that employs 3D matrices that mimic the TME and to use these scaffolds for co-culture of T cells and tumor grafts. The work will better define the physical parameters of the matrix (e.g. the extent of hydrogel stiffness, physical cues composition, and architecture) that affect T cell/tumor interaction and T cell function. Collectively, the work from both F99 and K00 phases will provide new fundamental understanding on the physical basis of T cell functions at molecular level and cellular levels. The outcome of this research may offer new design principles for targeted cancer immunotherapies."
"9277638","ABSTRACT: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer related death in the United States, with a five year survival rate of only 4%. We have recently shown that circulating pancreatic cells (CPCs) can be detected in the blood at the onset of the disease cycle in both mice and humans. These findings present an opportunity to develop a non-invasive diagnostic for pancreatic cancer that has enormous potential to improve patient outcomes. The current gold-standard for circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection fails to measure the extremely sparse and heterogeneous CPCs. Even next generation microfluidic technologies, which do not rely on epithelial markers, have limited utility due to the inherently low-throughput of microfluidics and the large sample volumes of blood (V > 10 mL) necessary for ultra-rare cell detection. To address these challenges, we are developing a new approach to rare cell detection, using magnetic micropores, which combines the benefits of micro-scale sorting with extremely fast flow rates (100x faster than typical microfluidic approaches2,5-7). In addition to its improved throughput, our technique is robust against unprocessed clinical samples, allowing rare CPCs and CPC clusters to be isolated directly from whole blood. Moreover, we are integrating this approach with ultra-rapid on-chip RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (RNA FISH), enabling single molecule, multiplexed RNA analysis in individual rare cells. Our device, which combines the above features into a self-contained, automated format, is designed to extract the RNA expression of single CPCs in clinical settings."

"9514401","Contact PD/PI: DREZNER, MARC K NRSA-Training-001 (001)  J. NRSA Training Core Project Summary: The University of Wisconsin (UW) Graduate Program in Clinical Investigation (GPCI) was developed by the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) and continues to be administered by the ICTR Workforce Development group. GPCI houses multiple educational options for trainees in the translational research continuum, but all are based on a common didactic foundation encompassing biostatistics, epidemiology, clinical study design, clinical trials conduct, and the ethical and responsible conduct of research. These essential curriculum elements are shared by the Certificate in the Fundamentals of Clinical Research, the MS in Clinical Investigation, and two PhD programs. The PhD in Clinical Investigation is an applied degree in which trainees focus on the creation of novel methodologies and tools for translational science within the context of a specific biomedical discipline. The PhD in Clinical and Translational Science leverages the core curriculum to give trainees the skills and tools necessary to move their biomedical research along the translational pathway. Since its inception in 2008, GPCI has created a robust infrastructure for training future members of the translational workforce that has allowed students in the program to accumulate an impressive record of publications and research awards. For this NRSA application, new leadership has been appointed distinct from the parental UL1. David DeMets, PhD, and Elizabeth Meyerand, PhD, both have outstanding training records with mentees at all levels and are exemplary investigators in translational sciences. Specific aims include maintaining both existing, high-performing PhD programs; applying an integrated evaluation approach for continuous program improvement and longitudinal outcomes tracking; and developing recruitment strategies to foster trainee diversity and success. In addition, a new postdoctoral training program will be created for individuals with professional degrees (MD, DVM, PharmD, Nursing) to enhance the translational potential of their prior research and provide a bridge to future independent careers in translational sciences. All trainees will benefit from the existing comprehensive mentoring approach, development of individualized career development plans (ICDP), and integrated program activities including federally-mandated training (HIPAA, CITI, GCP, RCR, etc.) and additional training in team science, scientific leadership, mentor-mentee relationships, and writing manuscripts and grants. GPCI also provides career development seminars and workshops in innovation and entrepreneurship. The expanded program will support 15 two-year appointments combined in all pre and postdoctoral categories.

"9421826","Abstract: The goal of this project titled ?Developing chemical probes for oncogenic signaling pathways? is to promote identification of small molecules/chemical probes for cancer targets to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms driving cancer and drug discovery efforts at the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC). My Unit Director Dr. Said Sebti, is the Program Leader of the Chemical Biology Molecular Medicine (CBMM) program and Chair of the Drug Discovery Department, and recently awarded an R35 outstanding investigator award. I have demonstrated success in several medicinal chemistry projects in collaboration with Principal Investigators, and the 5 projects described in this application are funded via NCI. These projects will involve development of: 1. ACK1, 2. Mutant KRas, 3. Dual Aurora A /JAK2 inhibitors 4. Chemical probes to understand the mechanism of action of targeted drugs, and 5. Bifunctional molecules to target protein degradation. The synthetic chemistry strategies/approaches described in my proposal are expected to generate novel compounds to address significant challenges in several types of human cancers. The synthesis and validation of bifunctional molecules as PROTACs in kinase projects (ACK1, Aurora A-JAK2) is expected to advance the field/help to define tractable targets for this approach and provide new cancer therapies. As part of this award, I will continue to provide the Moffitt research community with critical enabling chemical biology support. This will include: structure based design and synthesis of focused libraries (hit-to-lead-optimization) to identify new compounds/chemical probes to explore the molecular mechanisms of proteins involved in cancer; scale-up synthesis and formulation of potent compounds (e.g. prodrug/salt formation, solvent/excipient optimization) for in-vivo studies; design/synthesis of chemical probes for affinity-based proteomics. In addition to the projects described here, I have several other medicinal chemistry collaborations with Cancer Center members that will lead to new directions in cancer therapy and I am in a unique position to integrate projects from the CBMM and Immunology programs. My contribution via synthesis of compounds was essential for peer reviewed publications and grant applications. Some of the major findings enabled by my contributions over the past 5 years include: (i) synthesis and development of Aurora A-JAK2 inhibitors and their application in GVHD; (ii) identification of novel, potent ACK1 inhibitors; (iii) synthesis of chemical probes for assessing target specificity of in-clinic tyrosine kinase and PARP inhibitors; (iv) synthesis/development of dual BRD4-kinase inhibitors, and (v) development of novel non- covalent proteasome inhibitors. I strongly believe the research projects described in this application will facilitate new directions, approaches, new chemical probes and drugs to study and target cancer, and I will devote 70% of my efforts (8.4 calendar months) to this award."
"9339509","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Candidemia, the fourth most common bloodstream infection in the U.S., and other forms of systemic candidiasis are associated with mortality rates of 40% or more despite treatment with antifungal agents. The Candida albicans cell wall is central to the pathogenesis of candidiasis, but mechanisms that link cell wall regulation and virulence are only beginning to be understood. Recently, we demonstrated that C. albicans rapidly delocalizes phosphatidylinositol-(4, 5)-bisphosphate (PI (4, 5) P2) and septins as part of the natural response to the cell wall-active antifungal caspofungin. Furthermore, we identified a novel C. albicans PI (4, 5) P2-septin pathway that regulates cell wall integrity and virulence among mice with candidiasis. We hypothesize that the ability to activate or down-regulate the PI (4, 5) P2-septin pathway as dictated by the environment (i.e., balanced regulation) is necessary for optimal C. albicans responses to cell wall stress during drug exposure or invasive candidiasis. The objectives of this project are to prove our balanced regulation hypothesis, validate the proposed PI (4, 5) P2-septin pathway, and identify its outputs. We will pursue three specific aims. The first aim is to demonstrate that balanced PI (4, 5) P2 regulation correlates with protective responses to caspofungin. Dynamic PI (4, 5) P2 responses will be correlated with cellular viability in PI (4, 5) P2- regulatory mutants and caspofungin-susceptible and -resistant C. albicans strains. The second aim is to establish interactions between PI (4, 5) P2 and other PI (4, 5) P2-septin pathway components during caspofungin exposure and invasive candidiasis. Interactions will be assessed by tracking components during time-lapse live cell imaging, demonstrating physical interactions, and visualizing interactions within cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). PI (4, 5) P2 levels in pathway mutants will be directly correlated with PKC- MAPK cell wall integrity pathway activation. The third aim is to link transcription factors to the PI (4, 5) 2-septin pathway, and identify transcriptional outputs and pathway targets that contribute to caspofungin responses and pathogenesis. Transcriptional outputs will be defined during intra-abdominal candidiasis of mice by using RNA-Seq, a largely unbiased method that comprehensively quantitates gene expression. The project employs a series of innovative techniques to study a novel pathway that is relevant to antifungal drug resistance and the pathogenesis of candidiasis. Therefore, it is likely to yield clinically useful insights that wouldnot be obtained through other studies. Our findings will be significant because they will explain how the PI (4, 5) P2-septin pathway governs cell wall integrity, echinocandin susceptibility and resistance, and pathogenesis, and place the pathway within the context of other regulators of these processes. The project will open new avenues of investigation that will define, in detail, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the PI (4, 5) P2-septin pathway contributes to diverse types of candidiasis, and the impact of cell wall regulation on interactions with the host."
"9337585","Project Summary/Abstract  Accumulation of A? peptide in the brain appears to initiate Alzheimer?s disease (AD), including tau aggregation which then plays a major role in disease progression. In humans and animal models of AD, brain regions with the highest levels of synaptic activity show the greatest amount of A? plaques, suggesting A? production is closely related to synaptic transmission. Studies from our lab have demonstrated that direct modulation of synaptic activity dynamically regulates brain A? and tau levels in awake animals, with increased synaptic activity rapidly increasing brain interstitial fluid (ISF) A? and tau levels and vice versa for suppressed activity. These findings strongly suggest a close temporal relationship between synaptic activity and A? and tau levels in the brain ISF. The brain extracellular space plays a particularly important role in AD biology. A? plaques are extracellular structures with the majority of A? that builds onto an existing plaque coming from the brain ISF. Hyperphosphorylated tau tangles are intracellular structures and were long thought to be independent of the ISF; however, recent studies demonstrate that tau can be secreted from one neuron into the ISF, then internalized into a nave neuron to corrupt intracellular tau in that neuron and cause aggregation. Understanding mechanisms that regulate A? and tau kinetics within the brain ISF should provide valuable insight into disease pathogenesis.  We hypothesize that pathological forms of A? and tau are spread between brain regions in a synaptic- dependent manner. We propose that neurons function within a network to regulate not only the amount of A? and tau released, but also the conformation (monomer, oligomers, etc.) of A? and tau that is released. Aim 1 will determine the relationship between synaptic frequency and A?/tau levels and species. Aim 2 will determine how glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons independently impact A? and tau in the ISF. And Aim 3 will determine how local synaptic activity within target brain region affects tau propagation. While several studies suggest that synaptic activity within the initiating brain region drives A? and tau secretion in the target region, how local synaptic activity within the dendritic target region affects tau uptake, propagation and seeding is unknown.  We have developed a novel micro-immunoelectrode electrode (MIE) technology that detects A? and tau  with very high temporal resolution in the brains of living mice (measures A? in vivo every 60 seconds over  several hours). MIEs are highly selective for either A?40, A?42, tau, or their aggregates, enabling us to  determine how synaptic activity regulates the rapid dynamics of these peptides and conformations in vivo.  In this proposal we will utilize MIEs to measure rapid changes in A? and tau levels within intact neuronal  networks and from specific cell types. Studies will include young APP/PS1 mice and young P301S mice  prior to A? or tau pathology, as well as aged pathology-bearing mice to determine how pathological events  change the relationship between activity and ISF protein metabolism. We will also use the APP/PS1 and  P301S mice bred together to determine how synaptic A? impacts synaptic tau generation, and vice versa."
"9419236","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is growing evidence for the role of stress in cardiovascular pathologies, cancer, and other diseases. Work from our group and others has shown that psychological states such as chronic stress or depression may accelerate growth of existing tumors and promote chemoresistance. Importantly, a significant number of ovarian cancer patients are clinically depressed or lack social support. These emotional states have been linked to sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and decreased survival. Our group has shown that activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to increased levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the tumor microenvironment and ovarian cancer progression by inducing pro-tumoral pathways. Our preliminary data in cancer cell lines suggest that norepinephrine significantly changes the expression of genes implicated in ovarian cancer and attenuates cisplatin-induced ovarian cancer cell apoptosis. Given the importance of BRCA1-regulated DNA repair mechanisms in cisplatin response, adrenergic regulation of BRCA1 expression in tumors may also impact ovarian cancer progression and resistance to platinum-based therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms behind these observations are not completely understood. In this pilot we will test this hypothesis by achieving the following aims: 1) To dissect the effects of adrenergic signaling in ovarian cancer cells and 2) To explore the association between perceived stress and depressive symptomatology with tumor catecholamines, DNA damage, and BRCA1 protein expression. This proposal provides a unique approach to explore the link between stress and ovarian cancer outcomes at both the tumor level and the patient level. This proposal will provide the groundwork for additional research on precision medicine by linking psychological risk factors with underlying tumor biology."
"9032886","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this K23 proposal is to support the early career development of Dr. Anne Fernandez, a clinical psychologist with specialized expertise in addiction and health psychology. This award will facilitate her program of research - evaluating and implementing screening, brief interventions, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol use disorders in novel medical settings. Her career goal is to improve patient health, enhance hospital outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs through carefully timed alcohol-use interventions. In this career development award (CDA), she will facilitate these career goals by developing expertise in four training areas: (1) multi-disciplinar health services research, (2) SBIRT implementation practices, (3) qualitative data collection and analysis, and (4) quantitative methods in medical research. She will acquire this training through expert mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on research. The research portion of this CDA is a randomized controlled trial that will pilot test SBIRT for risky alcohol use prior to elective surgery. This CDA builds on existing research indicating that moderate alcohol use (> 2 drinks/day) increases the risk of postoperative morbidity, while heavy alcohol use (> 4 drinks/day) increases the risk of postoperative mortality. These risk factors increase utilization f health care services, placing undue burden on patients, providers, and the healthcare system. To date, no randomized controlled trial has ever evaluated whether SBIRT can reduce alcohol use prior to elective surgery and improve postoperative health outcomes. This K23 will take the first steps in addressing this research gap. The three research aims are to: (1) assess the healthcare system to guide implementation of presurgical alcohol SBIRT, (2) to conduct an open trial of SBIRT in a presurgical clinic, and (3) to conduct a randomized pilot trial of alcohol SBIR prior to elective surgery. These research aims incorporate several novel components, including a mixed-method healthcare assessment and simultaneous evaluation of both efficacy and implementation outcomes. These steps will ensure the protocol addresses the needs of the larger healthcare system. Successful study completion will result in new information regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of SBIRT for risky drinking prior to surgery. This program of research and training will allow the candidate to initiate a career conducting patient-oriented research that will ultimately reduce problematic alcohol use, improve patient health, bolster hospital outcomes, and reduce the cost of postoperative care."
"9435051","Project Summary  Of the non-coding genome that makes up about 98% of the human genome and plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression, about half consists of retrotransposons, a large group of transposable elements (TEs) that can ?copy and paste? their own DNA in the host genome. Variations in DNA sequence and RNA expression of regulatory elements, rather than of protein-coding genes, act as major risk factors in neuropsychiatric disorders, like schizophrenia (SZ). While evidence is emerging that RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation may rewire gene-networks, we still lack a detailed knowledge of these processes in the neural genome.  HERVs are the most represented elements of the Long Terminal Repeat class (LTR) of TEs, and make up 8% of the nuclear DNA. Intact HERVs maintain the structure of a retrovirus, but the vast majority are truncated or just Solo-LTRs. Yet, HERVs can be functionally expressed, acting primarily as enhancers or promoters of neighboring genes in various tissues, as in the brain, with a putative functional role in diseases, like SZ. However, almost all HERVs studies looked at the expression of a given sub-family, like up-regulation of HERV- K expression in SZ, rather than pinpointing the exact genomic instance of a specific HERV (eg HERVK-1), limiting our understanding of their functional role.  We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to improve the assessment from RNA-sequencing data of individual HERV transcriptional profiles at their chromosomal location and further confirmed our in silico findings with an independent experimental validation. Building on our expertise in developing methods and algorithms for detecting and analyzing TEs from sequencing data, we propose to map HERV transcripts to their specific chromosomal locations and quantify their expression in the CommonMind dataset (n = 600), the largest publicly available post-mortem Dorsal-Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) dataset for SZ. We will test whether their expression is altered in SZ (Aim 1); whether HERV-associated SNPs are functional eQTL in SZ (i.e. HERV-eQTL) (Aim2); and, finally, whether differentially expressed HERVs are regulatory elements by assessing their interaction with protein-coding target genes using Chromosome Conformation Capture on Chip (4C) (Aim 3).  Following the identification of differential expression of HERVs in brain tissues, we are now prepared to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which HERVs impact on the neural genome and detect how their dysregulation contribute to Schizophrenia. Identification of these mechanisms will make a major contribution to our understanding of how epigenetics can reprogram the neural genome, opening up new avenues for developing pathogenic-targeted drug treatments in schizophrenia."
"9339536","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Epilepsy occurs in about 1% of Veteran patients and is not controlled by current anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in approximately one third of patients. For the third who do not have their seizures controlled and for those who find AEDs to have unacceptable side effects, new treatment approaches are needed. An alternative treatment can be metabolic and a protein and high fat diet without glucose, the ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control in those patients who do not respond to conventional AEDs. The ketogenic diet inhibits glycolysis, the breakdown of sugar, and seizure control is lost when glucose ingested.  A novel alternative to the diet is to inhibit glycolysis using 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), a glucose analog that interferes with the initial isomerization step in the glycolytic pathway. 2DG is being evaluated as investigational new drug and offers a new therapy option. 2DG has been shown to decrease the development of epilepsy in the kindling model as well as having acute antiepileptic effects in the 6 Hz and audiogenic stimulation models, and against chemoconvulsants in hippocampal slices. We will try to determine what effects 2DG has on neuronal excitability at a single neuron level and at the neuronal network level. By defining mechanisms of 2DG's antiepileptic properties, we expect new approaches to therapy of epilepsy will follow. 2DG also appears to have disease-modifying actions, and this proposal will study the use-dependent action of 2DG's effects. Our underlying hypothesis is that inhibition of glycolysis by 2DG results in antiepileptic effects, and we will address possible mechanisms as they relate to neuronal membrane excitability and changes in synaptic transmission.  We will assess the following 2 specific aims:  Aim 1: To identify changes in membrane excitability produced by 2DG treatment. We will evaluate a number of possible mechanisms of action as they relate to inhibition of glycolysis and a change in energy substrate near the membrane. This will include analysis of action potential generation which may be changed by a decrease in sodium-potassium pump, enhancement in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensitive potassium channel that is activated with a decrease in ATP levels, and changes in the afterhyperpolarization that follows action potential generation.  Aim 2: To assess 2DG's effect on synaptic transmission mediated by presynaptic mechanisms that alter the network excitability of the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Specifically we will see how 2DG alters the abnormal synaptic activity that occurs after prolonged activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor activation and produces CA3 epileptiform synchronization. We will also define changes in synaptic transmission using minimal stimulation and analysis of miniature post synaptic currents.  All studies will use the CA3 region of the hippocampus which is vulnerable to epileptiform synchronization, in part related to the properties of the CA3 neurons and their recurrent excitatory synaptic network. We will assess CA3 neuron firing characteristics using sharp intracellular electrode recordings and how they change after 2DG. We will also use patch and whole-cell voltage clamp recordings to study intrinsic and postsynaptic currents.  Our approach will test for specific changes in single neuron and network synaptic function that are modified by 2DG and will elucidate potential mechanisms of action for the antiepileptic effects of glycolytic inhibition. In the proposed study, we will be performing experiments that will increase neuronal activity to load neurons with DG and monitor for use-dependent effects that may explain any disease modifying features of 2DG treatment. Defining these actions will give new therapeutic targets for antiepileptic drug development as well as understanding the mechanism of 2DG's acute antiepileptic action."
"9560997","Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center  High Throughput Screening Shared Resource (Translational Research Resource)  Project Summary/Abstract  The High Throughput Screening Shared Resource has a strong track record in both chemical and RNAi  screening. The former is carried out via full-file and subset screening of our compound library (+230,000  compounds) and by supporting confirmation, dose-response studies, and secondary activity profiling of  selected hit compounds as well as synthesized and purchased synthetic analogs. For early, preclinical drug  discovery efforts, the Resource provides advanced project support that encompasses structure-activity  relationship (SAR) studies, bioassay-guided fractionation of natural products, cheminformatics and  bioinformatics support, and data storage and integration via our Laboratory Information Management System  (LIMS). For the identification of novel therapeutic protein targets and pathways, the Core carries out screening  of genome-wide siRNA libraries and supports confirmation and characterization of the genes and pathways  identified as potential points of therapeutic intervention. All of these activities are engaged in ~3900 square  feet of laboratory space using the latest in screening technologies and instrumentation by a director who has  several years experience in industrial and academic drug discovery and a well trained and experienced  scientific staff. Together, the director and scientific staff bring more than 30 years of experience to bear on  every screening project.  The Resource works collaboratively with principal investigators (biologists, chemists, and statisticians) and  other shared resource and core facilities to achieve both therapeutic and basic research goals. The success  and impact of the Resource can also be measured in terms of the pre-clinical drug and target discovery  activities that are enabled downstream of screening. To date, the Resource has executed over 195 screening  projects (98 small molecule and 97 RNAi screens). From these efforts, over 64 publications derived from high  throughput screening have appeared in high profile journals and the patent literature. These results have  provided the foundation for successful funding of over 60 grant applications for screening programs and  advanced characterization of established chemical leads and drug targets. Importantly, several discoveries  from screening programs have led to commercial follow up via licensing. One of the keys to our success as a  collaborative core facility has been the tight integration of our expertise with medicinal chemistry, ADME  (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion), and in vivo efficacy. Seven (7) chemistry faculty  members in the Biochemistry Department enable lead optimization and development in pre-clinical drug  discovery programs. Their efforts are supported and enhanced by the Pharmacology Core which carries out  ADME, toxicity, and efficacy studies.

For human genes these identifiers can come in many forms in many different databases, e.g. EnsembI ENSG00000087053, Vega OTTHUMG00000153837, Entrez Gene GenelD:8898, UCSC uc001pfu.2, GeneCards GC11M095566, H-lnvDB H1X0010045, OMIM *603557, but the most user friendly unique identifier is undoubtedly the HGNC gene symbol, which in this example is MTMR2. Gene symbols are more easily recognized, remembered and pronounced, and hence are used as the primary descriptors in all of the above databases. These symbols enable communication, collaboration and understanding across the biomedical sciences and beyond. The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is the sole worldwide authority assigning standardized nomenclature to human genes, and maintains a searchable public database of over 32,000 named human genes at www.genenames.org. This funding will allow for the continuance of the vital work of the HGNC, in particular naming newly identified human protein-coding and RNA genes, pseudogenes, and copy number variant genes in regions annotated by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC). A further key activity will be the reassignment of genes with uninformative identifiers to function-based names as this information is elucidated and published. The HGNC will also continue to play a pivotal role in the coordination of annotation of the remaining unresolved gene structures in the human genome. In 2009 representatives from the vertebrate genomics community met at a workshop organized by the HGNC and agreed that gene naming across all vertebrate species should be based on human gene names. Building on their years of experience the HGNC will establish a resource for naming genes in other vertebrates, in collaboration with phylogenetics experts, specialist advisors for complex gene families, and communities working on specific species. This resource will be initially populated with expert-curated data for the cytochrome P450 and olfactory receptor gene superfamilies."
"9383829","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized patients. Understanding the pathophysiology of AKI is essential for the development of therapy. This application proposes to study the role of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) in AKI. This protein is expressed exclusively in the kidney by cells of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) of Henle. In the last few years, we uncovered a key role of THP in mediating a protective tubular cross-talk in AKI. We showed that THP regulates inflammatory signaling and injury to S3 segments, which are neighboring tubules to TAL in the kidney outer medulla. The immediate goal of the current proposal is to study the importance of the interaction of THP with S3 segments in regulating neutrophil infiltration and limiting oxidative stress in AKI. These studies will form the basis to transition into therapeutic applications. Indeed, the PI's long term goal is to understand how the role of THP can be modulated to treat patients who develop AKI. The central hypothesis is that Tamm-Horsfall protein regulates the inflammatory response triggered by ischemic injury in the outer medulla; an effect that requires an interaction of THP with the surrounding tubular elements. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary and published data. The following specific aims will be used to investigate this hypothesis. Aim 1 will investigate the role of THP as a key regulator of neutrophil infiltration in the kidney after AKI. Aim 2 will study the functional significance of the interaction of THP with neighboring epithelium in kidney injury Aim 2 will investigate therapeutic modulation of THP to inhibit neutrophil influx and promote recovery after AKI This research will involve the use of THP knockout and wild type mice. The animal model used for AKI is renal ischemia-reperfusion injury achieved through renal pedicle clamping. In vitro studies will involve cell lines for proximal tubules. Other techniques used in this work include: Immunofluorescence laser micro-dissection of specific tubular sections, Immunofluoresence confocal and intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, real time- PCR, western blot, various forms of chromatography and mass spectrometry. This research is innovative, because it will uncover novel regulatory functions for THP that may be relevant not only in kidney injury but also in other forms of acute or chronic renal disease. Future strategies that enhance the role of THP in the kidney will be of important therapeutic significance."
"9344964","Despite hundreds of clinical trials and dramatic advances in our understanding of the genetics and molecular biology of the disease, the median survival of patients suffering with glioblastoma has gone from 12 months three decades ago to 15 months today. No wonder that few of the roughly 20,000 glioma patients I have cared for over the years are still alive. Clearly a new way to understand and approach this disease is needed. In this proposal I hypothesize that a major reason for the lack of successful therapies in gliomas is a failure to model the complexity and resulting emergent properties of the ?cancer state?. Our ability to comprehensively understand and ultimately therapeutically manipulate complex cancer phenotypes will require the creation of clinically relevant models that intrinsically embrace that complexity. Given that these parameters are not met by any current model system, it is the intent of this proposal to take a novel approach to cancer research by building a model that for the first time will allow us to study GBM in the laboratory as the human disease that it is.  To that end we propose building an in vitro model of the human brain harboring a growing tumor in a patient-specific manner. We have achieved the first iteration of this initiative by successfully generating human cerebral organoids generated from human embryonic stem cell lines and from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. These cerebral organoids have almost all of the correct cell types and correctly oriented neuro-anatomic compartments seen in a 20-weeks of human fetal brain. Moreover, primary patient-derived GBM stem cells grow within their autologous cerebral organoids and form destructive tumors that phenocopy the parental clinical tumor. Likewise, we can form de novo GBMs by introducing genomic aberrations of the patient's original tumor within their own cerebral organoids by using advanced gene editing techniques.  I now propose that cerebral organoids, or patient derived ?minibrains,? offer a unique and novel model system for studying GBM by creating a complex ?tumor system? in vitro that largely recapitulates in vivo conditions of tumor growth but in an experimentally manipulable, biologically (clinically) relevant, logistically pragmatic and scientifically rigorous way. This approach will allow us for the first time to mechanistically study clinically apparent emergent phenomenon of GBM, not previously studied, ultimately leading to novel and more effective strategic therapeutic approaches to this devastating disease."
"9466595","Project Summary The overall goal of this SBIR proposal is to develop a novel vaginal stent for use in pediatric and adult populations. There are many girls and women born with congenital gynecologic abnormalities requiring surgical reconstruction of their vaginal cavities. There are also women who have very shortened or scarred vaginas after pelvic surgery or radiation treatment for cancer. Vaginal stents can be used after neo-vagina creation to prevent scarring and re-stenosis. There are no currently available vaginal stents that meet the anatomic needs of pediatric and adolescent girls or women who are post treatment for gynecologic cancers. As such, there is a high rate of post-surgical complications such as vaginal tissue scaring and vaginal stenosis. We propose to create new vaginal stents with improved fit, ease of use, unique deployment and retrieval mechanisms, and enhanced comfort for a pediatric population and for those women with shortened vaginas. BioTex has entered into an option agreement with collaborating physicians at Texas Children?s Hospital (Baylor College of Medicine) to create the newly designed stent based on pending patents filed by our clinical collaborators. The objectives of our Phase I proposal is to build fully functional prototypes, conduct benchtop testing, and perform in vivo studies in porcine vaginal tracts to demonstrate performance of the stents. We believe this new vaginal stent will reduce post-surgical morbidity, early discontinuation of stent use postoperatively, reduce health care costs, and improve clinical outcomes for girls and women across North America."
"9394920","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Heavy/at-risk alcohol use is considered a relevant public health problem given its association with sexual risk behavior, accidents, poor health, and negative life consequences (5,6). Dual process models of alcohol use describe two cognitive systems involved in the maintenance of heavy alcohol use?a top-down control system and bottom-up automatic appetitive system (8-11). Existing evidence-based interventions for alcohol use tend to focus on enhancing individuals' self-control (top-down) skills. Lately researchers have highlighted importance of targeting automatic appetitive cognitive biases that heavy drinkers exhibit. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is one intervention that has shown promising effects on reversing cognitive biases toward alcohol among individuals with alcohol use disorders (19-23). CBM is currently thought to alter cognitive biases that may interfere with implementation of skills-based or motivational interventions and may act best as an adjunct to existing interventions (18). Recent work has begun to look at the neurocognitive mechanisms of action of CBM and has found significant changes in brain systems underlying reward (i.e., NAcc and amygdala) and executive control (i.e., dlPFC, mPFC) (26,27). In line with these findings, this proposed project would investigate the effects of CBM on neurocognitive processes related to alcohol use in a novel sample of heavy/at-risk drinkers. The primary aim of this project is to examine the effects of CBM on neurocognitive processes among heavy/at-risk drinkers interested in changing their alcohol use. As a secondary aim, this project will investigate associations between neural and cognitive changes and changes in alcohol use to better understand how CBM might lead to successful changes in drinking behavior. Heavy/at-risk drinkers (n=40; ages 18-34) will be recruited from the community for this project and phone screened for eligibility. Participants will undergo baseline assessments, a cue-reactivity (CR) and approach avoid task (AAT) during fMRI, web-based intervention for alcohol use, and randomization to CBM or sham training. The first training session (CBM vs. sham) will occur at this time, followed by 4 online sessions over one week. Baseline assessments and fMRI procedures will be repeated at 1-week follow-up and drinking will again be measured online via 1- and 6-month follow-ups. It is hypothesized that the CBM group will exhibit greater changes in BOLD activity compared to the sham group in the above identified regions during CR and AAT tasks and show greater reductions in drinking. In line with NIAAA's priority to ?devise effective methods for?treating alcohol abuse and dependence [and] alcohol-related consequences? using a ?wide range of scientific areas? this proposed project incorporates both neuroscientific and clinical approaches in attempting to better understand the mechanisms of CBM. This proposed project aims to extend recent findings of such mechanisms in patients with alcohol use disorder to heavy/at-risk drinkers using a primarily web-based intervention. This study would also be the first to investigate associations between BOLD changes and drinking behavior following CBM."
"9419545","This application proposes a cluster randomized trial to evaluate an innovative staff intervention targeting resident-to-resident elder mistreatment (R-REM) in 6 intervention and 6 control assisted living residences (ALRs). Data will be collected at baseline, 6- and 12-months. We define R-REM as negative and aggressive physical, sexual, or verbal interactions between residents, that in a community setting would likely be construed as unwelcome and have high potential to cause physical and/or psychological distress. R-REM is a serious behavioral problem that has a negative impact on the quality-of-life and physical well-being of residents with and without Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias living in congregate settings. The applicant team is uniquely positioned to conduct this project because of its expertise, multidisciplinary composition, and its previous successful collaborative efforts. Aim 1 (A1). Enhance staff knowledge of R-REM Aim 2 (A2). Enhance staff recognition, reporting and care planning related to R-REM Aim 3 (A3). Evaluate the impact of the staff intervention on resident falls, accidents and injuries and on quality  of life using a prospective experimental design that derives information from five sources: (1) Resident  interviews (2) Staff informants (3) Observational data (4) Chart and (5) Incident/accident report data.  Primary Hypothesis: The frequency of falls, accidents and injuries will decrease in the intervention  group, relative to the comparison group after implementation of the training intervention.  Secondary Hypotheses: 1. Resident quality-of-life as measured by affective state will improve in the  intervention group, relative to the comparison group after implementation of the training intervention.  2. Resident behavior problems will decline in the intervention group, relative to the comparison group  after implementation of the training intervention. Resident behaviors will mediate the relationship  between the intervention and the falls/accidents/injuries outcome. R-REM has been identified as an important problem in long-term care settings, and our earlier studies identified significant behavioral problems in these settings. However, to our knowledge no interventions targeted at staff have been proposed or tested. The proposed trial is thus timely and innovative. The results are likely applicable to the over 1.2 million residents of AL facilities. With the expected rapid growth in ALRs, and the growing trend to include residents with significant care needs and dementia-related behaviors, the project will serve an important role in improving the quality of care provided by staff."
"9407835","ABSTRACT Burn injury care has improved in the past decades, but complications still occur and lead to prolonged hospital stays and potentially to death. The risk of infection rises as a result of burns since the skin layers, which function as a barrier and prevent pathogens from accessing the susceptible body tissues, are no longer intact. Importantly, infections involving gram-negative or gram-positive pathogens are still the most common cause of mortality in burn injury patients. Although topical treatments exist, there is a need for an antiseptic that can effectively penetrate to the site of infection and that can be used for treatment of pathogens found in medical facilities. To address this need, CorMedix proposes to develop a combination of taurolidine encased in digestible nanosystems as topical treatment at burn sites. This proposed gel formulation will be administered to the skin surface and will penetrate through to the epidermal/dermal junction at which it will be digested by local tissue enzymes, releasing taurolidine, a taurine amino acid derivative with broad antibacterial action against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria and some clinically relevant fungi. CorMedix's proposed product will combine the proven antiseptic capabilities of taurolidine with effective delivery to the site of infection, allowing prevention and treatment of infections including those caused by pathogens that have already been found to be resistant to currently used antiseptics. CorMedix will develop this proposed product and demonstrate successful penetration of taurolidine to the site of infection through two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim #1, a gel formulation with taurolidine containing nanoparticles will be developed by (1) Selection of a buffer that facilitates taurolidine stability during the nanosystem manufacturing process; (2) Selection of material for nanosystem surface (3); Testing of nanosystem susceptibility to subcutaneous tissue enzymes; and (4) Selection of gel matrix for suspension of nanoparticles. In Specific Aim #2, the developed formulation will be tested in vitro using a Franz cells model."
"9381086","Abstract. RNA plays a key role in most aspects of gene regulation, and is increasingly viewed as a drug target. To fully exploit RNA in medicine and biology, innovative approaches are needed to probe the interactions between structured RNAs and small molecules with the goal of elucidating how binding alters cellular function. Riboswitches are natural RNA sensors located typically in the 5-leader of mRNAs where they bind cognate effectors to regulate downstream genes. We previously determined representative crystal structures of the three known preQ1 riboswitch classes revealing: new tertiary folds, novel determinants of ligand recognition, and diverse strategies to bury associated Shine-Dalgarno Sequences (SDSs). Nonetheless, a substantial gap still exists in the field's understanding of the underlying signal transduction pathways that connect effector binding to gene-regulatory conformation. To address this formidable challenge, we developed new tools to cogently relate structure to function: (i) we prepared a robust bacterial reporter in which a preQ1 riboswitch represses GFPuv expression in response to the effector preQ1 (EC50 6.9 nM); (ii) we developed SiM-KARTS (Single Molecule Kinetic Analysis of RNA Transient Structure), which detects effector-induced conformational changes by monitoring repeated association and dissociation events between the riboswitch SDS and a probe mimicking the 3-end of 16S ribosomal RNA. Our results show that SDS exposure occurs in `bursts' that diminish with preQ1; (iii) we developed 2-methylnicotinc acid imidazolide (NAI) and 3-nicotinoyl azide (NAz) to probe specific preQ1 riboswitch conformations that regulate the in cell GFPuv reporter, whose control status is visualized by fluorescence. These novel approaches form a strong basis to investigate the premise that discrete signal transduction networks link effector binding to riboswitch gene regulation. We will address this overarching goal in three dovetailed aims: (Aim 1) Identify preQ1 riboswitch mutants integral to signal transduction; (Aim 2) Quantify SDS accessibility and dynamics of riboswitch variants; and (Aim 3) Relate riboswitch biophysical data to in vivo chemical modification analysis to elucidate interaction networks operative in gene regulation. To our knowledge, no other group is using such tools and approaches to dissect effector- mediated signal-transduction pathways for an entire riboswitch family. We are a team of experts comprising four P.I.s with strong records in: RNA structural biology, effector binding, RNA mutagenesis, and biophysical studies (Wedekind, P.I.); single-molecule FRET and methods development (Walter, U. Michigan); RNA probing reagents, protocols, and analysis (Spitale, UC Irvine); and `RNAstructure' prediction using experimental restraints (Mathews, University of Rochester). We are uniquely qualified to perform this research. High-value outcomes include the unprecedented elucidation and in vivo validation of signal transduction pathways used by riboswitches to control translation. This work will also contribute broadly to our knowledge of ligand-mediated control of RNA conformation, while providing new tools to analyze RNA structure and function relationships."
"9312137","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) caused by blast concussion from improvised explosive devices and other explosive ordnance is the signature injury of United States Service Members deployed to Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn in Iraq (OEF/OIF/OND). Repetitive mTBIs increase the risk for two progressive neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) with onset in midlife and Alzheimer's disease (AD) with onset in later life. Production and deposition of neurotoxic peptides are believed central to the pathogenesis of CTE and AD. Both CTE and AD are characterized by the intraneuronal deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau peptide (p- tau181) as neurofibrillary tangles. AD is further characterized by the deposition in brain parenchyma of beta amyloid (A?42) peptide as plaques. Concentrations of tau, p-tau181 and AB42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are established biomarkers of neurodegeneration in AD. The recently described brain glymphatic system is a major mechanism for clearance of neurotoxic proteins and other molecules from the brain. Increasing brain clearance of tau, p-tau181, A?42 and other neurotoxic molecules by increasing brain glymphatic flow is a potentially effective approach to mitigating the increased risk of CTE and AD following mTBI. Preclinical studies have established that mTBI reduces glymphatic flow, thus decreasing brain tau clearance and increasing brain tau deposition. Fortunately, brain glymphatic flow and neurotoxin clearance are substantially increased in preclinical studies by the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin, a clinically available drug widely prescribed for nighttime PTSD symptoms. We propose a proof-of-concept randomized placebo controlled pilot study in Veterans with repetitive mTBIs to determine if prazosin decreases concentrations of tau, p-tau181 and A?42 in CSF. Such a finding would be consistent with increased glymphatic clearance of neurotoxic molecules from brain and provide rationale for larger scale studies of clinical evaluation of prazosin for prevention of CTE and AD subsequent to TBI. Forty OEF/OIF Veterans with a history of multiple mTBIs will be randomized to prazosin or placebo for 8 weeks. CSF will be collected by lumbar puncture at pretreatment baseline and again after 10 weeks of study drug treatment. It is hypothesized that prazosin (but not placebo) will decrease CSF concentrations of tau, p- tau181 and A?42. If this hypothesis is confirmed, this study will support further trials of prazosin as a potential primary prevention treatment to reduce risk of CTE and AD following mTBIs. CSF tau, p-tau181 and A?42 concentrations will be determined by Luminex multibead assays."
"9448446","Project Summary It is unknown how functions of the brain give rise to psychotic experiences in severe psychopathology. Consequently, available treatments for psychotic disorders are often marginally effective. Abnormal visual perception is evident in psychosis (e.g., hallucinations) and noted in people with genetic liability for psychotic psychopathology (e.g., heightened illusions). Current evidence points to early visual abnormalities in psychosis that may trigger a cascade of errant neural activity creating distortions in one's visual experience; however, it is unclear how basic visual and complex guidance functions of the brain separately contribute to visual misperception in psychotic psychopathology. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to use sophisticated psychophysical tasks and neuroimaging to a) precisely characterize behavioral and neural abnormalities in individuals with psychotic disorders during visual perception, b) detail the mechanisms of visual hallucinations and distortions through the development and testing of a computational model c) determine if the mechanistic anomalies also mark genetic liability for psychosis. The goal will be accomplished by studying individuals with psychotic disorders (IPDs), one first-degree biological sibling of each IPD (SibIPDs), and healthy controls (HCs) demographically similar to the other two groups. We hypothesize that individuals prone to visual hallucinations exhibit stable neural abnormalities in early visual cortex (V1, V2) causing errors in the processing of visual elements, and that visual hallucinations occur in IPDs when contextual influences of more anterior regions (LOC/fusiform, prefrontal cortex) on visual perception become deviant. Individuals prone to anomalous visual illusions but without a psychotic disorder are hypothesized to exhibit a stable decrement in high-level influences on visual perception reflected in anomalies of inter-regional neural synchronization. We will employ contrast discrimination, surround suppression, attention regulation, and ambiguous object tasks to assess early visual perceptual processes, with and without contextual modulation, in IPDs, their unaffected biological siblings (SibIPDs), and healthy controls (HCs), to determine when task performance predicts self-reported visual misperceptions. We will compute cortical source signals from 248-channel MEG data functionally localized through 7 Tesla (T) fMRI to detail the location, timing, and synchronization of neural responses during visual perceptual tasks assessing local and long-range processes in IPDs, SibIPDs, and HCs, as well as determine how neural responses elicited by tasks predict variation in self-reported visual misperception. We will also characterize visual responses in all tasks using the Gaussian Scale Mixture model originally published by Schwartz et al (2009) and recently extended in our work to generalize across multiple scene segmentation cues (Qiu, 2013). We will use this model to test whether terms reflecting local inhibition are selectively reduced in all IPDs and whether the strength of the term representing long-range modulation correlates with frequency of visual hallucinations."
"9444132","Project Summary: Project 3, Neural Coding and Dynamics?Subcortical Regions  Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The individual parts of the project cohere conceptually, in part, because they all involve rodents trained to perform a type of decision-making task that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. Although most previous characterization of neural correlates of working memory and decision making has focused on cortical regions, there is growing appreciation that subcortical regions contribute to these processes as well. Thus, this project focuses on characterization of the neural dynamics underlying working memory and decision-making in a network of subcortical regions. Speci cally, cellular-resolution two- and three-photon calcium imaging will be used to characterize neural coding and dynamics in dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, granule cells and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, medium spiny neurons in the striatum, and pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. This data will be supplemented with multi-electrode recordings, which capture fast neural activity that calcium imaging cannot. The experiments will combine these two data types for the  rst time in the setting of a working memory and decision-making task. The results from this project, together with those from another component that investigates similar measures in neocortex, are expected to provide an unprecedented amount of data that will give new insight into the processing of task-relevant information during a cognitive task across a wide variety of cortical and subcortical areas. Another component will combine these results with temporally and spatially speci c inactivation data from the other two components to build and constrain a biophysically realistic, multi-region computational model of the behavior."
"9347766","ABSTRACT  This application to the Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program is for commercialization assistance for our NIBIB Phase 2 Project ? TB Diagnostics at the Point of Care. The Phase 2 Project is funded through an RFA that specifically addresses health disparities ? tuberculosis (TB) in the case of this project. For every TB-infected white person in the United States, there are an estimated 9 African-Americans, 8 Latinos, 6 Native Americans, 23 Asians, and 21 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders with this disease. Compounded with this disparity is the prevalence of drug-resistant mutations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), which have an associated 1000 polymorphisms that span 36 genes, two promoter regions, and one ribosomal RNA coding region. Current methodologies (primarily available only to affluent healthcare communities) still include microbial cultures, which require sophisticated laboratories and weeks before a result can be determined. Minorities in a low socioeconomic class with difficulties commuting and/or following up with their physicians are at risk of not obtaining appropriate treatment. A low-cost, simple-to-use, high confidence test that detects MTB and its resistance to multiple drugs would improve TB diagnostics for these minority communities. However, current technologies lack the sensitivity, specificity, and/or multiplexing capacities needed to achieve this goal.  We therefore propose to commercialize a drug resistance MTB test that offers the sensitivity of culture and the specificity of nucleic acid methods across a broad coverage of mutations, at an affordable price. For this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program we propose to become ISO 13485 certified so that we can market the test to the international community, and specifically to those countries with high at-risk populations."
"9419086","Pilot Research Project 2: Lifestyle-Associated Metabolites Drive Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Prostate Cancer Disparities SUMMARY In South Carolina (SC), prostate cancer mortality differences between blacks with African ancestry (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) are amongst the highest in the nation. Emerging studies demonstrate inherent genetic and molecular characteristics within tumors contribute towards the racial disparity. This study aims to define the impact of a group of lifestyle-associated metabolites known as advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) on promoting a more aggressive prostate cancer phenotype through the upregulation of miR-204, MYC and the downregulation of the androgen receptor (AR). miR-204 is encoded within the TRMP3 gene9 and studies have demonstrated that expression of miR-204 and TRPM3 are positively correlated both in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, TRMP3 is amplified in 32% of neuroendocrine prostate cancer cases. The investigators have supporting data that AGEs can upregulate miR-204 and drive NED in vitro; and in prostate cancer patients, both AGEs15 and miR-204 are elevated in AA men, when compared to EA men. Preliminary data supports metformin as an endogenous inhibitor of miR-204 which in turn reverses the neuroendocrine phenotype. This study will be co-led by Dr. Ashley Evans-Knowell at South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Dr. Victoria Findlay at the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC). Hypothesis: The occurrence of high AGEs and ADT drives neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) through up- regulation of miR-204 and this event is more prevalent in AAs, accounting for the higher prostate cancer mortality rates observed in AA men. Specific Aim 1: To investigate the role of AGE, ADT and miR-204 in driving neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer. This aim will be led by Dr. Findlay (MUSC-HCC). Specific Aim 2: To establish miR-204 and AGE levels in a cohort of human prostate cancer patients and to correlate those levels with race, clinical, and other demographic data. This aim will be led by Dr. Evans- Knowell (SCSU). Impact: A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive NED within prostate tumors will allow the development of novel strategies to prevent or reverse this process in patients receiving ADT, thus potentially improving clinical outcomes. The proposed mechanistic link between lifestyle-associated AGEs, microRNA regulation, and NED in prostate cancer could lead to interventions to improve prostate cancer outcomes for AA men. This project is synergistically related to the other research projects included in this application."
"9479804","PROJECT SUMMARY CLINICAL CORE The goals of the Clinical Core are 1) to accrue the necessary samples and associated clinical data from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) patients and healthy subject cohorts to support the research projects of the proposed ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center (ME/CFS CRC), and 2) to engage the ME/CFS patient and advocate community through online platforms and outreach. The Clinical Core will be based at the Bateman Horne Center of Excellence (BHC), a patient-centered research and clinical care center focused specifically on improving the clinical management of ME/CFS and fostering research into biomarker discovery and mechanisms of disease. The Core will implement standardized processes for subject recruitment, enrollment and clinical specimen collection, clinical data acquisition (in coordination with the Data Management and Coordination Center) and subject follow up. It will implement clinical evaluation to objectively quantify orthostatic intolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive efficiency. It will also oversee storage and distribution of clinical samples to ME/CFS CRC investigators. The Clinical Core will also leverage BHC's expertise in patient engagement and its extensive network of patient partners and advocates to facilitate community support for the proposed research and retention of recruited subjects. A community engagement coordinator will work with enrolled ME/CFS patients to regularly self-track, through online App in collaboration with ?We are Curious? platform, their symptoms and treatments, along with daily activity, dietary interventions, and environmental exposures, providing support and guidance throughout to facilitate retention throughout the study period. The Clinical Core will be led by Drs. Lucinda Bateman and Suzanne D. Vernon, both deeply experienced and respected members of the ME/CFS clinical and research communities. Under their oversight, the Clinical Core will address the theme of the ME/CFS CRC by enhancing patient engagement and subject participation, improving sample and clinical data collection, ensuring efficient selection of subjects, and facilitating acquisition of robust and relevant patient parameters. The Specific Aims are: 1) To identify, refer and enroll patients with new-onset ME/CFS along with age, race and sex-matched controls for longitudinal clinical tracking and serial sample acquisition; 2) To conduct clinical evaluations to objectively define fatigue and daily function, post- exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive impairment and orthostatic intolerance using common data elements, standardized questionnaires and devices; 3) To oversee storage and sharing of clinical phenotype and biological sample data in coordination with the Data Management and Coordination Center (DMCC); and 4) To partner with We are Curious and MEAction groups to develop questionnaires, tags and tracking systems that reflect patient symptoms and experiences with ME/CFS, and bridge patient partners and the clinical and scientific teams through education and outreach."
"9450006","Project Summary Infant obesity is increasing in the U.S., particularly among Hispanics. Rapid weight gain during critical periods of infancy increases the risk of obesity in childhood, continuing into adulthood and increasing the risk of chromic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. This serious health threat could be prevented through multifaceted interventions during infancy that address multiple risk factors associated with early obesity development. Current evidence suggests that trials should focus particularly on risk factors related to physical activity, sleep, nutrition, satiety, stress and increasing parenting skills, and should be delivered at multiple levels, using population-level programs to be translatable, cost-effective and sustainable. To this end, interventions carried out within the federal WIC program provide a potentially powerful way of fostering early healthy behaviors and helping in preventing obesity. Successful interventions done as part of the WIC program could be translated into their policies, since each state develops its own educational materials and determines how nutritional education is implemented. Our goal is to test the clinical effectiveness of a multi-faceted and multi-leveled intervention focusing on three main areas: physical activity (i.e., infant activation, sleep and screen time), nutrition and growth monitoring, framed in the Health Self-Empowerment Theory, and delivered through the WIC Program using a multi-media approach. The physical activity and growth-monitoring components are new to the WIC curriculum, while the nutrition component is based on WIC guidelines but delivered differently (through self- empowerment-based messages and multi-media based). For this, we will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial among pregnant women participants of the Puerto Rico WIC (PR-WIC) program. An equal number of clinics will be randomized to the control (usual care) arm or to the WIC+ (usual care + intervention) arm in the San Juan area. The lifestyle intervention will focus on age-appropriate infant physical activation, healthy sleep and limiting screen time, healthy dietary patterns and growth monitoring. The content will be delivered with a multi-media approach (web-platform, mobile messages and phone follow-up). Participation in the intervention will begin in the last trimester of pregnancy and continue until the infant is 12 months old. We have already pilot-tested the information of this intervention among 10 mother-infant dyads during their first year of life, with excellent acceptability. We will determine the extent to which the intervention may impact adequate weight gain, infant activity and nutrition from birth to 12 months of age compared to the control arm. We will also evaluate the cost of this intervention as a modification of the current WIC curriculum. Such approach has not been tested before among infants. If successful, this intervention could be adopted as a policy-supported best practice by the PR-WIC program to help prevent infant obesity. This will help improve minority health and eliminate health disparities among Hispanics and other at-risk groups."
"9566488","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated human oncogenes. In some settings oncogenic KRAS can trigger cellular senescence, whereas in others expression leads to hyperproliferation. Given the importance of KRAS mutation in human cancer, elucidating the mechanisms regulating these two drastically distinct outcomes would help identify novel therapeutic approaches in RAS-driven cancers. We have identified a novel role for Wilms tumor-1 (WT1) as a critical regulator of senescence and proliferation downstream of oncogenic KRAS. Loss of Wt1 leads to senescence in mouse primary cells and human tumor cells in an oncogenic KRAS- dependent manner. In addition, WT1 expression is specifically upregulated in chemoresistant tumor cells in a mouse model of lung cancer. These findings reveal an unexpected role for WT1 as a key regulator of the genetic network downstream of KRAS and suggest a key role for Wt1 in chemoresistance. In this proposal, we will use a combination of molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches to elucidate the mechanistic basis for the observed interaction between oncogenic KRAS and WT1. Preliminary data suggests that at least part of the role of WT1 is mediated by post-transcriptional regulation of RNAs. Thus, this proposal will use state-of- the-art approaches to analyze the role of Wt1 on splicing and protein translation. In addition, we will determine the role of WT1 in regulating chemotherapy resistance in KRAS-driven lung tumors."
"9505037","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple immunotherapies have demonstrated long-term clinical benefit in patients with melanoma. Clinical trials are currently underway to build upon this activity in melanoma, and to see if similar benefits can be achieved in other cancers. Despite the advances made over the last few years, there is currently limited understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy. An improved understanding of resistance may identify patients that are most likely to benefit from current immunotherapies. Further, identification of resistance mechanisms that are targetable may lead to combinations that are more effective. Previously we demonstrated that targeting BRAFV600 mutations, which are the most common somatic alterations in melanoma, increases the efficacy of immune-mediated killing of tumors through multiple mechanisms, leading to ongoing clinical trials. Recently, we have found evidence that loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which occurs in 20-30% of melanomas with BRAFV600 mutations, may also contribute to resistance to immunotherapy. Our preliminary experiments show that loss of PTEN in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells inhibits T-cell mediated killing of melanomas in vitro , decreases intratumoral accumulation of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) in vivo, and correlates with reduced success of TIL expansion from patients. Our data also demonstrates that loss of PTEN correlates with inferior clinical outcomes among BRAF-mutant melanoma patients, reinforcing the clinical significance of this subpopulation. Loss of PTEN results in marked activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, a pathway for which many targeted agents are available and currently undergoing clinical testing. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the PI3K-AKT pathway in tumor cells is the critical mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in BRAF-mutant melanomas, and that inhibition of this pathway will increase the efficacy of T-cell mediated immunotherapy. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize multiple unique clinical and preclinical resources that we have established to develop more effective therapeutic approaches for melanoma patients. First, we will utilize our preclinical models and diagnostic platforms to interrogate the mechanisms that underlie resistance to T-cell mediated killing and trafficking of T cells to melanoma with loss of PTEN. Second, we will analyze specimens from several cohorts of melanoma patients to determine the immunological features and immunotherapy treatment outcomes associated with PTEN loss. Finally, we will determine the effects of PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors, alone and in combination with FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors, on T-cell viability, function, and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vio. Together these studies will improve our understanding of the role and therapeutic potential of the PI3K-AKT pathway in resistance to immunotherapy in melanoma. Further, as the PI3K-AKT pathway is implicated in multiple tumor types in which immunotherapies are being tested, the findings may have broad applications for cancer patients."
"9525558","ABSTRACT Raheem Paxton, PhD is a behavioral scientist seeking to focus his career on cancer survivorship. In this no- cost extension period, we propose to finalize the remaining aims of our original application and expand our focus to include rural cancer survivors. The work proposed in our application complements our initial aims which were to (1) examine the correlates of physical activity in secondary data and (2) examine the feasibility and a lifestyle intervention in African American breast cancer survivors. Our work indicated that African American breast cancer survivors experienced significant barriers and comorbidities that prevented regular engagement in physical activity. However, they were receptive to participating in interventions; particularly, those delivered via email or the Web. Therefore, we recruited and randomized an ethnically diverse sample of breast cancer survivors to either a 3-month physical activity or dietary condition delivered via email. Preliminary data indicated that survivors were satisfied with A Lifestyle Intervention via Email (ALIVE) and would recommend it to other cancer survivors. In addition, we found that ALIVE was associated with significant improvements in physical activity, reductions in sedentary behavior, and positive trends in fruit and vegetable consumption, relative to the comparison condition. In the no-cost extension period, we propose to examine the real-time correlates of physical activity, dietary intake, and sedentary behavior in a sample of rural cancer survivors via experience sampling methods. Using this sampling method will provide a landscape for understanding the psychosocial and contextual factors that predict lifestyle behaviors in real time. Furthermore, accomplishing these goals will lay the groundwork for developing a behavioral intervention that occurs in real time. The mentoring, coursework and related skill development will enable me to accomplish my long-term goal of developing interventions for at-risk and underserved cancer survivors. Pending Submissions: Funding Mechanism: Earlier.org Title: Cumulative Risk and Metabolic Dysfunction in African American Women Abstract: Cumulative exposures to chemical (i.e., personal volatile organic compounds) and non-chemical stressors (i.e., diet, exercise, substance use, depression, and social determinants of health) place minority women at greater risk for developing metabolic abnormalities and aggressive cancer subtypes. Although studies have examined the individual impact that lifestyle, environmental exposure, and biological mediators have on cancer initiation, development, and metastasis, there is a paucity of literature documenting the cumulative risk associated with these factors. The primary aim of this study is to determine the association of a cumulative risk assessment score with salivary markers (e.g., estrogen, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), cancercinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) related with metabolic abnormalities and cancer. Data will be collected from 120 postmenopausal African American women. Urine and saliva samples will be collected to examine environmental exposures and cancer-related markers. Cumulative risk score will be developed based on equations generated from Machine or Statistical Learning (e.g., Random Forest, Regularized Regression). Results of this study will serve as preliminary data for a larger award to collect primary data for understanding evidence-based relationships between chemical, non-chemical stressors, and metabolic markers associated with various metabolic disorders. Funding Mechanism: Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas Title: Disseminating A Lifestyle Intervention via Email (ALIVE) to Cancer Survivors Abstract: The proposal represents new collaborative partnerships between the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC), Texas Health Resources (THR), JPS Center for Cancer Care (JPSCCC), Cook Children's Health Care System (CCHCS), and community-based organizations to disseminate a nutrition and PA survivorship care plan in the clinical setting and an evidenced-based person wellness coaching program entitled ?A Lifestyle Intervention via Email (ALIVE)? to cancer survivors throughout the state of Texas. ALIVE, a web- and email-based platform, has demonstrated efficacy in improving HRQoL as well as nutrition and PA behaviors. Our long-term goal is to improve HRQoL among cancer survivors by improving physical activity and dietary patterns. This proposal will achieve that goal by educating clinicians and community-based organizations on the ACS guidelines on Nutrition and PA, and disseminating ALIVE to cancer survivors in long-term follow-up clinics. In particular, our educational initiative will target survivorship practitioners in the clinical- and community-based settings. Moreover, we will aim to disseminate >10,000 nutrition and PA survivorship care plans and enroll 1500 cancer survivors of various diagnoses into ALIVE portal. The implementation, dissemination, and evaluation of the proposed study will be guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) Framework. The collaborative team brings state-of-the-science experience in programming, vital community outreach, training knowledge, and program evaluation expertise together on this proposal to facilitate the dissemination of the ACS guidelines on nutrition and PA throughout various settings to continued monitoring and adaptations to assure its sustainability for the foreseeable future. Therefore, this proposal is highly significant for its potential dissemination throughout the state of Texas and its ability to make meaningful improvements in HRQoL via changes in lifestyle behaviors."
"9551755","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer still kills 45,000 women a year in the US alone and over 270,000 women are given a diagnosis of either invasive or in situ disease. Screening is our major public health intervention. And yet we likely overdiagnose as many or more women than we save with screening and it does not impact the outcomes of the most aggressive cancers. We have assembled an extraordinary set of resources that include datasets with long term follow-up as well as a unique prospective trial that will include comprehensive host risk and tumor annotation to address the underlying biology (from both the tumor and host perspective) of indolent (IDLE) and interval cancers. Our goal is to identify better ways to screen for and treat the most aggressive cancers and avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment as well as the inadvertent labeling of indolent lesions as cancers. Testable Hypotheses 1. Commercially available assays can identify ultralow risk breast tumors (MammaPrint Ultralow Risk for invasive cancer, Oncotype-DCIS-category 1 for DCIS). 2. The combined use of commercially available assays plus additional genomic, pathology, and immune based assays along with mode of detection can further differentiate IDLE from ultralow breast lesions. 3. Among the malignant features differentiating screen-detected from interval breast cancers are the degrees of cellular and molecular heterogeneity and type/extent of immune microenvironment and host response. 4. Since interval cancers are often biologically distinct from screen detected cancers, we hypothesize that genetic risk factors will be useful to distinguish the risk of interval from screen detected cancers. Specific Aims: 1. Stratify low risk invasive tumors into low vs. ultralow vs. IDLE and high risk into interval vs. screen-  detected using gene expression profiling, pathology features, immune profiling in fully annotated invasive  cancer data sets and validate the best predictors in a prospective California-wide screening trial. 2. Develop adjunctive assays to stratify DCIS lesions into IDLE, ultralow, moderate and high-risk DCIS breast lesions using gene expression profiling, and measures of tumor immune micro-environment in established data sets and validate using a prospective registry of 300 DCIS cases 3. Develop a model using known germline breast cancer risk variants to predict women predisposed toward ultralow and IDLE screen detected tumors, and those predisposed to interval detected breast cancers, using data from a fully annotated California-wide screening trial that includes germline and tumor profiling."
"9370752","ABSTRACT Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting many organ systems, with hallmarks of B-cell abnormalities and clonal expansions in the blood, specific types of circulating autoantibodies and immune-complex mediated tissue injury. While the cause is unknown, in-depth genome- wide association studies have identified genetic intervals and alleles that are associated with disease predisposition. Environmental factors appear to have a large, although still poorly understood, influence.  There have been accelerating advances in understanding how the bacterial communities that live in us and on us contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Bacterial species, that in most hosts are normal components of our microbial communities, have been implicated in pathogenesis and therefore termed pathogenic symbionts or pathobionts. Yet in the great majority of adults these same commensal species are completely innocuous or even beneficial. We have found that SLE patients with active disease have imbalances (termed dysbiosis) in the distribution/diversity of bacterial taxa in their intestinal microbiomes.  Our overarching goal is to test the hypothesis that specific pathobiont commensal intestinal bacterial species contribute to lupus flares. In these studies we seek to understand how specific candidate pathobiont bacterial isolates contribute to Lupus pathogenesis and the expansion of disease-associated blood B-cell clones. In addition, we will study the effect of transferred gut microbiomes in murine models. The relationships between clones in the gut-associated B-cell compartment and in the systemic compartment in SLE patients will also be investigated."
"9546005","Project Summary/Abstract  The proposed studies are important because they will clarify the mechanisms by which insulin regulates liver glucose uptake under feeding conditions, both when insulin is secreted by the pancreas as well as when it is injected during the treatment of people with diabetes. Consuming a diet high in fat and fructose severely impairs hepatic glucose uptake. We will determine the degree to which this is caused by the liver's defective response to insulin and glucose, we will define its molecular correlates, and we will explore whether this dysfunction can be effectively treated by interrupting sympathetic neural input or glucokinase activation. In addition, glucagon is implicated in diabetic hyperglycemia and we will investigate whether glucagon acting in the brain can affect hepatic glucose production. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to determine the impact of insulin's direct vs indirect effects on the regulation of hepatic glucose uptake and storage under hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic conditions, 2) to characterize the source of impairment in hepatic glucose metabolism caused by a high fructose, high fat diet and to determine whether the withdrawal of sympathetic neural tone or glucokinase activation can overcome those defects, and 3) to determine the effect of brain glucagon action on the control of hepatic glucose production. Studies will be carried out in normal and diet induced glucose intolerant conscious dogs. Several weeks before study catheters will be inserted into the femoral artery, hepatic portal vein, and hepatic vein for measurement of hepatic glucose production and uptake, as well as in other vessels and sites as needed (splenic, jejunal, and jugular veins, carotid and vertebral arteries, the 3rd ventricle, etc.). The endocrine pancreas will be disabled with somatostatin, and insulin, glucagon and glucose will be infused as required by the study design. Liver glucose metabolism will be assessed using tracer and A-V difference techniques. Surgical and pharmacologic tools will also be used as needed to create the conditions required for the experiments. We will also assess alterations at the cellular level to better understand the physiologic phenotypes. The canine model is unique in that it allows for infusion (insulin, glucagon, glucose) into the hepatic portal vein, thus recreating real-life feeding conditions under steady state conditions which cannot be done in the human or rodent. In addition, the dog is unique in that it permits the measurement hepatic glucose uptake as well as output, which can only be done in a large animal. We believe that the knowledge gained from the proposed experiments will impact the development of new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of glucose intolerance and diabetes."

"9417892","The University of Nebraska Medical Center, in cooperation with the Native American Studies and Medical Humanities programs at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, will leverage the trust and cooperative spirit that we have garnered working with tribal schools and communities in Nebraska and South Dakota to develop, implement, and evaluate cancer-related science curricula and research experiences aimed to support Native American students. The long-term goals of this project are to promote student interest in the sciences, foster a more science-literate public, and ultimately to increase the number of Native Americans entering health and science careers with a particular emphasis in cancer research. Improving science instruction in the classrooms serving our Native American students and partners is key to this project. This objective will be accomplished by creating and adapting hands-on, age-appropriate lessons and by engagement with technology, Indigenous research methods, and Native science. Teacher support through summer workshops, mentoring, and in-service education will facilitate implementation of novel science strategies for use in tribal schools and with Native students. Student engagement will be enhanced through summer experiences from science camps for middle school to longer enriching programs for high school students. Moreover, select high school and undergraduate students will participate in long term research projects with the support of mentors. Programs reaching beyond the classroom will be designed to give parents and elders the sense of excitement and an understanding of what students feel when doing science. Ancillary benefits will include promoting educational opportunities, cancer awareness, the promise of clinical research and the the value of precision medicine for Native Americans. Professional evaluations will be made at all stages, with major emphasis being placed on evaluating the educational and community impact of the project. Research techniques including baseline and post measures will be conducted to assess the level of community readiness to address cancer within Native communities and schools. Analyses of attitudes and subject content, participant evaluation questionnaires, and student retrospective pretests will also be done. Advancing the health of Native American communities by better cancer prevention and treatment and increasing the numbers of Native American cancer research professionals is the ultimate aim of every aspect of this project."

"9464937","Project Summary The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is increasing rapidly around the world, with prevalence expected to rise by 150 % between 2010 and 2025. The rate of T1D increase is most notable in children 0 to 4 years of age, and in individuals previously considered at low- to moderate- genetic risk. This trend underscores an unmet need for T1D prevention strategies. Early identification of children at-risk for pancreatic islet cell injury is our best opportunity for T1D prevention. IgG autoantibodies targeting islet antigens (specifically insulin, GAD, IA-2 and ZnT8) signal pancreatic beta cell attack and are validated predictive biomarkers for T1D. Assays for detection of these autoantibodies are commercially available and have been used in multiple trials to predict progression to T1D. However, expansion efforts for T1D prevention have been greatly limited by the lack of a cost-effective, fast, reliable, and widely available assay for T1D autoantibodies detection in the general population. As the most meaningful natural history and prevention studies begin their screening in very early life, requirement of small volume sample for such test will be a key consideration especially when children are concerned. Using our nanoscience based pGOLD platform which provides femtomolar sensitivity and 6-log dynamic range for biomarker detection, Nirmidas Biotech. Inc. aims to develop and validate a fully automated, multiplexed assay for the diagnosis of T1D with sensitivity and specificity matching the current gold standard radioimmunoassay (RIA) done for clinical test, in a much faster, more cost-effective, lower complexity, smaller sample volume requirement and higher throughput format. Expanding on the prototype Phase I multiplexed T1D assay, the general strategy for achieving the Phase II project goals is to finalize the optimization of the analytical performance of the multiplexed T1D assay on pGOLD platform, followed by clinical validation of the assay with a large carefully chosen set of T1D and control samples. A fully automated system covering assay process and fluorescence reading with data acquisition/analysis/report will then be built and validated, which will facilitate FDA clearance and translation into clinical use of the pGOLD T1D test."

"9557551","Project Summary Recent human genetic studies identified a link between a class of centrosomal proteins and microcephaly, which is characterized by a selective reduction of brain size in comparison to other organs. The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel mechanism of microcephaly by understanding how dysregulation of mitotic progression and cell cycle re-entry leads to neural progenitor cell (NPC) reduction in microcephaly. This contrasts with the dominant model in the field that disruption of symmetric/asymmetric division of NPCs causes microcephaly. We will test this mechanism by focusing on WDR62 (MCPH2; OMIM 604317), which is the second most common genetic cause of human microcephaly and encodes a WD-40 repeat protein.  We created a hypomorphic mouse model of Wdr62 deficiency and found that mutant mice exhibited reduced brain sizes due to a decrease in NPCs. Wdr62 deficient NPCs exhibit mitotic progression delay and an increase in cell death. Wdr62 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed reduced spindle stability and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation. Wdr62 physically and genetically interacts with Aurora A, an established spindle assembly factor. In addition, Wdr62 localizes to the basal bodies of primary cilia and regulates cilia disassembly and cell cycle re-entry of MEFs. Depletion of Cep170, another Wdr62 interacting protein, also results in cilia disassembly, suggesting that Wdr62 may function together with Cep170 to regulate cilia biogenesis and cell cycle progression. These preliminary data lead to a novel hypothesis that Wdr62 regulates neural progenitor expansion in the developing brain by influencing mitotic progression and cell cycle re-entry, which are disrupted by disease mutations in a specific manner.  To test this hypothesis, three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Test the hypothesis that Wdr62 regulates mitotic progression of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by influencing spindle integrity; 2) Test the hypothesis that Wdr62 regulates cilia disassembly and cell cycle re-entry by functioning together with Cep170; 3) Test the hypothesis that individual disease alleles of WDR62 compromise its specific functions (mitosis or cilia disassembly) due to loss of regulation of specific Wdr62 interacting proteins. Together, these studies will improve our understanding of mitosis and cell cycle re-entry regulation of NPCs in the developing brain and provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying human microcephaly diseases."
"9561055","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC?s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program."
"9439576","ABSTRACT  The proposed intervention, Culturally Responsible Stress Reduction: A Mobile Mindfulness Application to Support Health Promotion for African Americans (CRSR), is designed to encourage the use of mindfulness to mitigate the disproportionate amount of stress-related health disparities facing African Americans.1-3 Current mindfulness approaches have been unsuccessful in engaging this population;19 therefore, we propose to bridge this disparity by developing an mHealth (mobile health) mindfulness application (?app?) tailored specifically to the cultural values of the African American community.  Mindfulness involves meditative practices that cultivate purposeful and nonjudgmental attention to current thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the body. Mindfulness has been incorporated into widely-used interventions, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).28 The CRSR app will be grounded in ACT and will integrate the convenience of mobile technology with tailored content to allow users to shift from potentially harmful culturally prescribed stress-coping activities (e.g., self-reliance, emotional suppression) to adaptive mindfulness-based stress-coping activities aligned with culturally specific values. This integration of content, backed by theory and empirical evidence, effective instructional delivery, an interdisciplinary development team, and modern communication technology will produce an effective mHealth intervention.  The CRSR app features will include brief (< 3 minute) guided meditations to connect the user to the present moment and a place of calm through culturally aligned exercises grounded in spirituality, orality, self- empowerment, and resilience; daily notifications prompting users to reflect and engage with the app; scheduled email messages on the importance mindfulness as a way increase control over physical and psychological health; and user-customized alerts.  Phase I will focus on proof of concept, i.e., the feasibility and social acceptability of the CRSR app. In Phase I we will develop a testable prototype that provides functionality for participants to practice mindfulness. Testing will occur with 42 African American participants and will result in a minimally viable product prior to full development and testing with a fully-powered RCT in Phase II. The final product will consist of a native mobile application on Android and Apple IOS.  The applicant, IRIS Educational Media, has assembled a knowledgeable and experienced team of research scientists, content and technology developers, and evaluation specialists to adequately realize this project. The company has an established track record of developing and marketing technology-assisted public health interventions."
"9439929","Project Summary/Abstract Globally, the burden of NCDs and injuries is substantial in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and economically devastating. The Disease Control and Priorities report by the World Bank reports in its second edition that nearly 45% of all deaths in LMICs are potentially addressable through effective EMS. However, very few LMICs have emergency medical service infrastructure. The Rwandan Ministry of Health created the Service d'Aide Medicale Urgente (SAMU) in 2007 to provide emergency medical services in the capital city of Kigali. The premise of this proposal is that by rigorously evaluating the services delivered by SAMU, we can ensure the delivery of high quality emergency care across diseases and conditions in Rwanda. In this exploratory grant, we hypothesize that by identifying index non-communicable diseases, injuries and other conditions through SAMU's unique electronic prehospital registry and implementing checklists to standardize prehospital emergency care, SAMU  will be able to deliver consistently high quality prehospital emergency care across a wide range of conditions and life stages. This proposal offers a unique and innovative attempt at building health system capacity across disciplines in order to address the burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries and will establish a rigorous model for prehospital care that is much needed in LMICs. Comprehensive research proposals will then be developed to seek further NIH funding to standardize care across all communicable and non-communicable conditions and injuries, evaluate the impact on clinical outcomes, and scale up d ata collection and QI systems across the country in collaboration with the Ministry of Health."
"9542530","Summary Bacterial colonization/infection is ubiquitous in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients and has been felt to be biologically relevant in disease. The quantity of airway mucus can be altered in COPD and contribute to chronic and acute airway obstruction, symptoms of chronic bronchitis and bacterial colonization. Correlations have been reported between the identification of bacteria and the intensity of the inflammatory/immune response, increased cough and sputum and increased rates of acute exacerbations of COPD. It is now appreciated that the COPD lung harbors a microbiome, distinct from that in healthy individuals, which is not captured by standard culture techniques. Unlike studies of the gastrointestinal tract, culture-independent analyses of the airways have not identified significant numbers of routinely unculturable bacteria. Rather, these studies implicate the existence of culturable bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas spp. that may go through cycles of culturability and unculturability during disease. These likely reflect changes in the nutritional environment of the lungs, adaptation to host defenses and changes in the metabolic activity of the bacteria. More recently, studies have begun to support the concept that host-derived factors during inflammation may be a driving force for adaptation and metabolic shifts in many respiratory bacteria. Our hypothesis in this proposal is that the inflammatory response (i.e. IL-17 driven inflammation, interferon (IFN)-mediated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction and activation of catecholamine-producing inflammatory macrophages) may also drive Pseudomonas infection, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of inflammation. P. aeruginosa has long been held to be an obligate aerobic bacterium; however, recent studies have highlighted that this is not true, providing a bacteriologic mechanism for its growth in mucus-rich regions of diseased lungs in the presence of ongoing inflammation. In support of this hypothesis, inflammatory macrophages can produce reactive nitrogen species and catecholamines, both of which have the potential to directly promote Pseudomonas colonization and virulence. In turn, this activates airway epithelial pathways involved in mucus over-production in the airways that, altogether, perpetuate airway disease by creating nitrate-rich micro-aerophilic or anaerobic niches that promote Pseudomonas colonization."
"9384237","One third of all eukaryotic proteins pass through the secretory pathway for targeting to specific locations, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, plasma membrane or extracellular milieu. Since misdirected proteins cannot function, the secretory pathway is critical for establishing and maintaining normal cell and tissue physiology. In particular, the COPII protein complex, which mediates vesicle trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, is a key control point for protein targeting. Moreover, mutations in COPII genes cause a range of human diseases, including cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (CLSD) and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Detailed knowledge of COPII vesicle trafficking is required to understand its role in cell physiology and to treat disorders in which it is disrupted. However, while the core COPII machinery is well defined, little is known about how mammalian cells regulate COPII activity in response to developmental, metabolic or pathological cues.  Recently, we and others found that several COPII proteins are modified by O-linked b-N- acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a dynamic form of intracellular protein glycosylation. Interestingly, glycosylated COPII components include Sec23A and Sec24D, which are mutated in CLSD and OI, respectively, manifesting in collagen mistrafficking and skeletal dysmorphology. However, the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on the COPII pathway remain unclear. In preliminary work, we used a chemical biology approach to show that at least four COPII components, including Sec23 and Sec24, engage in O-GlcNAc-mediated protein-protein interactions in human cells. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAc cycling hinders COPII trafficking. Finally, we found that an unglycosylatable mutant of Sec23A failed to rescue the collagen trafficking and skeletogenesis defects of Sec23A-mutant crusher zebrafish. Together, these results suggest that site- specific O-GlcNAcylation of individual COPII proteins governs vesicle trafficking in vertebrate cells and tissues.  The objective of this project is to define the mechanistic and functional effects of O-GlcNAcylation on the COPII pathway. We will accomplish our objective through three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will dissect the functional impact of O-GlcNAc cycling on COPII vesicle trafficking. In Aim 2, we will define the role of site-specific O-GlcNAcylation of Sec23A and Sec24D in human cells. In Aim 3, we will determine the contribution of COPII O-GlcNAcylation in vertebrate models of CLSD and OI. Our work will shed new light on how O-GlcNAcylation tunes protein trafficking in cells and tissues, and may reveal new opportunities to treat diseases of COPII dysfunction, such as CLSD and OI, by targeting protein glycosylation."
"9459010","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This is a renewal application for R01MH101269, ?Assessing causality: Is PTSD Cardiotoxic? and builds on our work in R21MH102570, ?PTSD and Cognitive Decline in Women.? Results provide compelling evidence that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases risk of many physical health problems. Our data further suggest that PTSD is associated with subtle cognitive deficits that may be early indicators of dementia and developing Alzheimer's disease. Together, our findings suggest adverse systemic effects of PTSD, predisposing women with PTSD to greater susceptibility to multiple diseases of aging. By leveraging and enhancing data with an existing cohort, we aim to address a critical research question: Does PTSD accelerate aging in women? We propose 3 strategies to address this question, and will draw on data from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), with a sub-cohort of 54,282 women followed since 1989 who have data on PTSD and will be 52-69 years at the start of this renewal. First, we will evaluate if PTSD is prospectively associated with patterns of cognitive decline linked to dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Second, we will examine the relation of PTSD with two genomic indicators of accelerated biological aging: DNA methylation (DNAm) or the `epigenetic clock' and shortened leukocyte telomere length (TL) each of which has been linked to age-related health outcomes. Third, we will examine how PTSD influences accelerated aging by examining symptom clusters as well as mediators and modifiers. We will address the following Specific Aims: 1) To evaluate prospectively if trauma exposure and/or PTSD severity are associated with cognitive decline; 2) To evaluate longitudinally if trauma exposure and chronic PTSD are associated with 2 well- established genomic markers of aging: DNAm (epigenetic clock) and TL shortening; and 3) To gain greater insight into how PTSD affects cognitive decline and genomic markers of accelerated aging in order to identify targets for interventions. Evidence that PTSD causes accelerated aging would suggest: (1) effective PTSD treatment may reduce risk of cognitive decline, subsequent dementia, and accelerated aging more broadly; (2) persons with PTSD may benefit from greater surveillance of health risk factors and early interventions to reduce acceleration of the aging process. Learning which cognitive domains and/or genomic biomarkers PTSD alters will provide new opportunities understanding the pathophysiology of the disorder and inform early identification and prevention of accelerated aging in women with PTSD. Taken together, the proposed research advances our understanding of a possible relationship between PTSD and accelerated aging and with risk of cognitive decline and impairment as well as with the pathophysiology of PTSD more broadly."
"9552296","Project Summary/Abstract  This project aims to investigate the circuit mechanisms which enable learned complex behaviors, such as speaking or playing an instrument. At present, the processes which underlie the generation of these behavioral sequences by neural networks are poorly understood. Specifically, the contributions of various cell types to this network behavior remain underexplored. Here we consider an important motor control nucleus in the zebra finch called HVC (formerly known as the high vocal center), which produces neural sequences during the performance of the learned courtship song. Our present proposal focuses on local circuit interneurons, which represent the sole source of inhibition to this network. Several models have been proposed to explain the role of inhibition in song production, but consensus remains elusive. To test these models, we propose a series of electrophysiological, imaging, and optogenetic studies that will enable us to manipulate and monitor HVC interneurons selectively, often in the context of song production.  In Aim 1, we will examine the role of inhibition from a postsynaptic perspective. The primary focus of this this aim is to record inhibitory synaptic currents in HVC premotor neurons during song production.  In Aim 2, we will measure interneuron network function by directly recording the activity of populations of identified interneurons during singing. We will also gauge the impact of individual interneurons on the network using anatomical and electrophysiological methods.  In Aim 3, we will use in vivo and in vitro measurements to characterize the genetic subtypes of HVC interneurons and to distinguish their roles within the network."

"9416011","Project Summary (Research Segment 2) The brain circuit is an intricately interconnected network of numerous cell types. To understand the principles of information processing in the brain circuit, it is essential to determine a catalog of cell types, how they are distributed throughout the brain, and how they are connected to each other. A cell's precise location within the brain (where is it?), its specific dendritic and axonal morphology (what does it look like?), and its structural connectivity with other cells in circuits and networks (who does it connect to?) are all critical anatomical factors which contribute to the definition and accounting of different cell types. We will produce comprehensive anatomical cell census data from brains of adult male and female mice, leveraging our existing mouse brain reference and connectivity atlases, and employing three major scalable approaches. We will map the spatial organization of transcriptomic cell types identified in Research Segment 1 using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) with combinatorial marker gene sets identified in the single-cell RNA-seq experiments. Furthermore, we will use MERFISH to determine the microenvironment, tissue composition and ratio of various cell types. We will generate full neuronal morphologies of representative cell types in major brain regions, using two different high-throughput and high-resolution whole-brain fluorescent imaging approaches and semi-automated morphology reconstruction methods. These systematically collected data will be used to discover rules underlying cell types as defined by their full dendritic and axonal morphologies. We will use an optimized rabies tracing system to do monosynaptic, retrograde trans-synaptic tracing to map whole-brain inputs to genetically-identified cell populations brain-wide. By combining this with the Allen Institute's already created anterograde projectome, we will be able to generate a first iteration of the mesoscale, input/output circuit wiring diagram. These different types of anatomical data will be integrated with each other and with other cell type characterization data modalities in a variety of ways, including coupling rabies tracing, full neuronal morphology, or in vivo functional imaging with multiplexed FISH, to derive an integrated cell type classification scheme."
"9468652","SUMMARY: The 2018 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Ligand Recognition and Molecular Gating will be held from March 4-9 at the Ventura Beach Marriott, Ventura, CA. The GRC will be preceded by the related Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which is organized by and for young scientists (March 3- 4). The topic of the GRC/GRS is unique, as it addresses the molecular mechanisms of three important classes of membrane proteins: ion channels, active transporters, and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These proteins are central to human physiology and their dysfunction leads to a large number of neuromuscular, endocrine, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In addition, these membrane proteins are targets for more than 50% of the currently available drugs. Therefore, it is essential to understand their molecular mechanisms in order to create new opportunities for pharmacological and medical intervention.  The central focus of this GRC/GRS is the molecular mechanism of ligand recognition and binding, solute transport, regulation of function, and signal transmission. There will be a strong focus on the structures of these proteins, as they provide a scaffold for the interpretation of functional data. In this area there have been several technological breakthroughs, most notably in electron cryo-microscopy, which has led to several medically important structures of transporters, channels and signaling complexes. Recent examples are the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator, the high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel, Slo2.2 Na+-dependent K+ channel and GPCR signaling complexes. Progress has also been made in understanding several fundamental processes that are key to the function of these proteins, such as proton and ion coupling in transport, gating mechanisms of major channels, and the formation of different signaling complexes. Efforts to identify new members of these important membrane protein families are also underway to provide a better description of the function of these membrane proteins in human physiology and disease.  This GRC is unique as it brings together scientists who work on these three different classes of membrane proteins and are located on different continents, and thus do not meet regularly. They will benefit tremendously from these interactions as these membrane proteins share common mechanistic principles and can be studied by a vast array of techniques, many of which will be represented at this conference. The program will have around 50 speakers, well-established leaders in the field, including several Nobel prize laureates, as well as promising young investigators, postdocs and graduate students. Nine speaker sessions and several poster sessions will address the major properties of transporters, ion channels, and GPCRs. Through discussion of the latest results this GRC/GRS will support future efforts in these areas of research."

"9447087","Abstract About thirty million people in the US have some type of liver disorder, and about 27,000 deaths are registered annually due to liver disease. At this time, the only definitive treatment of hepatic failure is orthotopic transplantation. However, there is a critical shortage of organs with a continual deficit of >4,000 livers per year. Given that only organs in pristine condition are transplantable, orthotopic transplantation will always remain a limited pool. Recent advances in tissue engineering through the use of decellularized liver scaffolds have opened the possibility that engineered liver grafts could be used as substitutes for donor livers, potentially addressing the shortage of organs available for transplantation. However, the road to clinical translation is expected to be long due to the wide range of functions the engineered liver is required to capture, for example, those represented by the biliary system have been neglected thus far. Furthermore, long term transplantation of engineered liver grafts has not been successful due to thrombogenicity of the recellularized grafts. We plan to engineer transplantable liver grafts for treating liver dysfunction and failure through the completion of the following specific aims 1) Enhance endothelialization efficiency of rat liver grafts, 2) Repopulate bile ducts of rat livers and 3) Develop a liver graft that functions in vivo. The work described here is expected to result in the next generation engineered liver grafts incorporating parenchymal and non-parenchymal components to provide auxiliary hepatic support."
"9449729","PROJECT SUMMARY The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will cultivate and sustain productive collaborations and partnerships with community-based organizations to foster awareness of and participation in health disparities research among minority populations in Arizona. The CEC will use the concepts of Inquiry and Action to guide a four-direction framework to pursue specific aims of: Dialogue, Knowledge, Action, and Reflection. Dialogue (Aim 1): Guided by the Communities in Action ? Pathways to Health Equity Model, the CEC will engage stakeholders (e.g., community-based organizations, community leaders, policy experts, and researchers) in guided communication and consensus building to synthesize existing regional ?needs assessments? and health promotion strategies to yield a meta-analysis of challenges and resources to identify commonalities in health trends, drivers of health disparities, and assets nurturing resilience. Knowledge (Aim 2): Drawing on outcomes of Aim 1, the CEC team will increase awareness of health disparities research, and develop and facilitate regular webinars that showcase successful community-university collaborations to promote recruitment, participation and retention of underserved populations in health disparity research. Action (Aim 3): Community Coalition Action Theory will support mobilization of multi sectorial, public-private and community-based organizations to address priority health disparities research areas through implementation and translational science. These activities will occur in bi-annual face-to-face workgroups and will establish action plans building on existing resources and establishing clear documentation of resource gaps. Reflection (Aim 4): The CEC will use NIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Partnerships for Environmental Public Health Indicators and the Community Readiness model to collect qualitative and quantitative measures of communities' and researchers' capacity, resilience and readiness for collaborative research. Key outcomes will be understanding of roles in and evolution of partnerships, promoters of health-related resilience (e.g., community collective action and advocacy) and willingness to invest in health equity research. The anticipated outcomes of the CEC's application of a four-direction framework is a picture of the shared and distinct determinants of health in Arizona that informs a dynamic comprehensive plan and SHERC-community partnerships designed to affect action at the community, provider and policy level for health equity research, dissemination, translation, and intervention."
"9232606","Patients with TNBC can benefit significantly from earlier diagnosis/prognosis, targeted therapy, and predictive biomarker panels for optimal therapy. However, currently there are no clinically accepted markers for the prognosis of TN BCa and to predict its potential to metastasize. Although genomics and to some extent proteomic approaches have been used to address this gap in knowledge, these studies have resulted in limited success. Mitochondria are the only organelles, besides the nucleus, that contain their own DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA is highly susceptible to mutations due to lack of protective histones and increased exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). A recent study reported that the tumor cells with depleted mtDNA are having delayed tumor growth. Similarly, when mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depleted tumor cells (?0 cells) were injected into mice, they enhanced their tumor growth property by acquisition of mtDNA from the host mouse cells and reassembling a mitochondrial electron transport chain complex (ETC) and respiratory function. Recent analysis of TCGA data suggested that `TCA Cycle and ETC gene sets' were the most frequently correlated gene sets to mtDNA copy number. Other one of the top correlated gene set was related mitochondrial Fatty Acid ?- Oxidation (FAO). These observations suggest that, at least in selected subgroups of cancers, mitochondrial biogenesis is important for their oncogenesis and tumor progression. PI lab recently discovered that mitochondrial reprogramming to FAO is critical in TNBC progression. Also, c-Src, FAO regulates one of the frequently activated oncopathways in TNBC by its autophosphorylation at Y419. We discovered that in Src activated TNBC, mitochondrial OXPHOS is enhanced. Src is also known to regulate several ETC proteins via its phosphorylation. Importantly, knockdown of FAO rate-limiting proteins carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) or 2 (CPT2) abolished Src (Y419) autophosphorylation and that TNBC metastatic properties. This proposal aim to understand the role of mtDNA copy number in FAO reprogrammed TNBC and Src signature. We currently have 67 TNBC and 65 adjacent benign tissues with metabolomic, genomic and clinical follow-up information. mtDNA copy number will be analyzed in these tumors and adjacent tissues. Further bioinformatic analysis will focus on the significance of copy number in already available FAO, Src signature and metastatic potential of these tumors. This information will be critical for future larger studies to establish mtDNA copy number as a prognostic marker for TNBC that has metastatic potential driven by Src cancer pathway. We have assembled an excellent team of collaborators to work on this project including experts in mitochondrial genetics, TNBC progression, metabolomics, and bioinformatics, who are excited to work with us on these proposed studies."
"9479806","PROJECT SUMMARY BASIC RESEARCH PROJECT Our goal in this project is to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the ME/CFS microbiome interacts with the immune system to cause disease. Abnormalities in immune activation are likely key contributors to ME/CFS disease severity. However, we do not know to what extent these abnormalities are: 1) microbial in origin, i.e., caused by microbial dysbiosis in ME/CFS patients; 2) caused by metabolites produced by microbiota that influence the immunological or metabolic pathophysiology; or 3) caused by genetic or environmental perturbation of immune sensitivity in ME/CFS patients. There is thus a strong need to identify the immune cells, bacteria, and molecular pathways that drive abnormal immune activation in ME/CFS. Here, we will interrogate microbes and immune cells harvested from ME/CFS patients through complementary pipelines, each designed to isolate one side of the microbe-immune axis. The microbial pipeline will compare ME/CFS- related bacteria collected from patients to bacteria from healthy controls using a set of relevant immune assays. The immune pipeline will compare immune cells collected from ME/CFS patients to healthy immune cells, exposing both to a battery of microbial triggers and immune cell activators. Together, these pipelines will pinpoint with molecular resolution the specific immune-mediated disease triggers unique to or significantly enriched in the ME/CFS condition. We expect to determine the relative contributions of microbes and immune cells toward the immune pathology observed in these patients. We also expect to identify how ME/CFS-related gut microbes impact different compartments of the immune system and to identify the immunomodulatory metabolite repertoire that underlies these interactions. This research project is highly synergistic with the clinical project, in that together they will establish microbial and immune correlates of ME/CFS disease severity and a framework for disease mechanisms. This project will also contribute to the goals of the CRC through: characterization of microbial and immune cellular and molecular mechanisms, identification of potential new therapeutic targets with characterized mechanism of action, and identification of potential microbial or transcriptional triggers, biomarkers, and risk factors. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To identify immunomodulatory bacterial strains from ME/CFS patients that may underlie immunopathology (Microbial Pipeline); and 2) To determine the response of ME/CFS patient immune cells to microbial modulators based on transcriptomic interrogation and epigenetic states (Immune Pipeline). Impact: By probing the immune responses of ME/CFS patients to microbial stimuli, we will define the molecular mechanisms by which ME/CFS-related gut microbes mediate immune activation. This work will also lay the foundation for rational discovery of therapeutics that target microbe-immune interactions, and development of engineered probiotics for ME/CFS treatment."
"9479805","PROJECT SUMMARY CLINICAL RESEARCH PROJECT The goal of the Clinical Project is to generate and integrate a complex network of clinical, immunologic, metabolic, and microbiome datatypes on the ME/CFS etiology to engender hypotheses on immune dysfunction in ME/CFS disease mechanisms. Given the lack of diagnostic molecular markers for ME/CFS and a very limited understanding of its etiology, there is critical need to define new risk factors and mechanisms of ME/CFS predisposition and severity. While early studies showed promise in identifying different metabolic, immunologic, or microbial biomarkers of ME/CFS, these studies were limited in scope, sample size, or, importantly, integration across datatypes, examining one or a small handful of correlates at a time. While this may be sufficient for diseases with a more straightforward mechanism, ME/CFS' compound symptoms and potential etiologies require integrated analysis that incorporates multiple datatypes. In addition, longitudinal and prospective studies are needed to identify mechanisms of disease progression and severity. We hypothesize that immune dysfunction is a central etiology of ME/CFS, both by virtue of its propensity to respond aberrantly to environmental stimuli and its vulnerability to aberrant stimulation by the ME/CFS microbiome and/or its metabolites. Our goal is to define likely clinical correlates of ME/CFS disease, centering on the microbiome and metabolome as immune triggers. We will address multiple central goals of the Center, most notably the application of computational modeling and machine learning approaches to integrate detailed clinical, immune, metabolomic and microbiome datatypes to characterize and predict the immune responses triggered and the associated clinical correlates. Moreover, this study will provide, in addition to valuable hypotheses to guide the mechanistic work proposed in the Basic Research Project, a battery of different immune, metabolomic, and microbial biomarkers associated with different ME/CFS subtypes and disease severity. This project benefits from the deep clinical research expertise at Bateman Horne Center and University of Utah CTSA, cutting-edge core services at The Jackson Laboratory, and the world-class computational and biostatistics team assembled here, with expertise in clinical study design and integrative modeling of large-scale complex genomics cohorts. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To assess immunological abnormalities and blood metabolomic changes prospectively in a large ME/CFS patient cohort; 2) To define correlations between microbiome ecological distribution and clinical state of ME/CFS; and 3) to establish ME/CFS clinical ontology with computational and biostatistical analysis of the immune, metabolic and microbiome interactome in ME/CFS patients. Impact: Success of our aims will yield a large-scale data repository and integrated analytic workflow that can accommodate samples from multiple centers. Identified correlates will be strong candidates for mechanistic biomarkers of disease and will provide hypotheses for mechanistic follow-up studies linking the microbiome to immune and metabolic dysbiosis in ME/CFS."
"9370683","The Psoriasis Center of Research Translation at Case Western Reserve University (CORT) will advance translational discovery and application in psoriasis using a cutting-edge systems biology approach that integrates patient-centered data within a rich and synergistic /collaborative institutional environment. We will leverage extensive preclinical, clinical and translational resources with the expertise and experience of our CWRU interdisciplinary research team, which encompasses bioinformatics, micro/myocobiome, psoriasis patient care, cutaneous immunology and transgenic models.  The overall goal of the CORT is to combine new bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT model will use a collaborative research project (CRP) as a central hub with bi- directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and test hypotheses, identify and test drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads; 2) Applied Meta-`Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome, micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify key novel pathways critical for psoriasis pathogenesis likely to benefit from intervention by new drugs or repurposed existing drugs for psoriasis therapy.  Our patient-centered translational approach will exploit and enhance a novel, comprehensive and highly annotated database of ~850 psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis single-patient case records that combines clinical information derived from CLEARPATH (an Ohio medical provider consortium-based unified EMR repository for research access), with inflammation markers that stratify subsets. Into each patient's EMR, we will directly integrate his/her meta'Omics data created by the AMC working with the CRP, to create an 'Omics-integrated EMR (EMRi) data set. These cohesive multi-platform personal data records will identify psoriasis patient endotypes based upon unique perturbations identified from their ?meta'Omics? analyses. Our overarching hypothesis is that by powerfully combining existing and developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies, we will identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care."
"9565173","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US1, 2. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Furthermore, most subjects will spend many years in a presymptomatic disease state (pre-COPD) before the onset of disease, even after smoking cessation. Identification of the at-risk presymptomatic current or former smoker is the crucial firt step needed to study early interventions that can prevent the development of COPD and emphysema. In pilot work we have identified multiple novel blood lipid (sphingomyelin and ceramide species) and protein biomarkers of COPD and emphysema. We hypothesize that some of these biomarkers will be stable molecular signature that can identify presymptomatic current and former smokers who are at risk for progression to symptomatic lung disease such as COPD and emphysema. Our proposal will measure candidate biomarkers in previously collected blood from three international longitudinal cohorts (COPDGene, SPIROMICS, and Big3) that contain large numbers of pre-symptomatic former or current smokers without COPD or emphysema, who have genome wide genotyping, and are followed 3-5 years with extensive clinical phenotyping including lung function and qHRCT. The first aim will identify which biomarkers are association with progression of airflow limitation and emphysema in those who do not have COPD at baseline. The second aim will investigate whether these signatures are stable over time and identify the genetic associations contributing to the biomarker signature."

This work was supported by a previous phase 1 SBIR from FDA-CVM which proved vital in obtaining required data for an FDA NADA and ultimately for a large licensing & commercialization agreement with Zoetis, the world?s leading veterinary health company. The current proposal of the first recombinant, much more potent and long acting equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) agonists for improved and more ethical reproduction in pigs and cattle is estimated both by Trophogen and potential partnering veterinary pharma companies to be an even larger annual worldwide market of $50-100 Million, a potential veterinary ?blockbuster?! In view of the PI?s remarkable success in developing and commercializing its first veterinary product with support of a phase 1 SBIR from FDA and validation of its technology and the potential market value of its reproductive products by world leader Zoetis, we hope that the current submission will receive expedited approval. The goal of this Phase 1 project is to develop and evaluate new recombinant eCG analogs as replacement for pregnant mare?s serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and P.G. 600 (PMSG+hCG). The use of PMSG obtained by inhumane bleeding of pregnant mares between days 40 and 130 of gestation is highly controversial and an inhumane business of PMSG production raises increasing concerns of the public and animals rights group. There are many limitations of current PMSG and related products including presence of horse serum contaminants in PMSG preparations, potential infection with equine viruses and prions, as well as immunological responses to highly heterogenous preparations produced in heterologous species (horse or human). There are no approved recombinant veterinary eCG products and the PIs were highly encouraged by increasing interest from major veterinary companies in their totally novel more potent and longer-acting recombinant gonadotropins, including new eCG analogs. In this Phase 1 we plan to: Aim1A Develop novel high affinity recombinant eCG superagonist analogs by minimal 4 arginine site-directed mutagenesis to produce a more potent and efficacious dual FSH + LH/CG activity molecule; Aim1B For selected eCG superagonists also engineer a novel minimal length amino acid insert containing one or two complex carbohydrate neoglycosylation sites to further increase half-life and produce analogs without reducing increased superagonist potency/efficacy; Aim 2 Optimize production and purification of these novel analogs using stable highly expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and low cost production methods in roller bottles; Aim 3 Select the best 2-4 analog candidates and characterize them in vitro by previously validated eCG analog ELISA immunoassay, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel analysis and robust in vitro FSH and LH/CG bioassays; Aim 4 Select the final eCG analog using the most important parameter determining in vivo performance: pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice; Aim 5 Establish CHO research cell bank (RCB) providing high expression of the lead, optimally neoglycosylated eCG analog sufficient for more expensive bioreactor production and all extensive rodent, pig and cattle studies in Phase 2."

The TRAC core will provide guidance to foster seamless transition  from study design and planning, procurement of biosamples and or data, through to the  generation of experimental data, and then coordinate with the DATA Core for analyses. The  TRAC core will facilitate investigator interface with the AA registry and the Columbia University  Recruitment registry, and enable optimal collection and preservation of biosamples, as well as  coordinate transport and processing of samples from distant sites. The core provides access to  the National Alopecia Areata Registry Database, allowing access to almost 11,000 individuals  who have given consent to be re-contacted for translational research in AA. We have also  created our own Columbia University IRB approved database of patients in the NY metropolitan  area with AA who wish to be contacted for participation in research. Additionally, the TRAC  Core will provide data coordination and biostatistical expertise in the design of pre-clinical and  clinical studies. The TRAC Core will provide patient ascertainment and procurement of AA  tissue samples (skin/scalp, blood, feces, microbiome, immune cells) for the purpose of building  an AA expression database from human and mouse models, which will be a critical resource  that will be extensively utilized by each of the AACORT components. The TRAC Core resources  will support the Research Project and Pilot and Feasibility studies, and interface closely with the  DATA Core. In addition, the TRAC Core will promote communication and collaboration between  preclinical and clinical researchers of AA, bridging the knowledge obtained from animal models  to investigate the pathogenesis, immunopathology, and treatment of AA. By facilitating  seamless access to biosamples from a well-defined patient population, and supporting  researchers with services to enhance scientific rigor, the TRAC Core is positioned to facilitate  the progress of translational investigation of AA pathophysiology and treatment."
"9484593","Abstract Project 2  Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth ages 10-24 and self-harm, which includes nonfatal  suicide attempts (SA) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are prevalent and are risk factors for future suicide  attempts and suicide completion. Self-harm behavior is a disparity for Latinas as well as for sexual/gender  minority youth. This study seeks to refine and test the efficacy of a computer assisted culturally informed and  flexible/adaptive intervention (CA CIFFTA) to address this disparity and to reduce the logistical barriers that  may contribute to underutilization of treatment. We focus the research on Latinas and Latino LGBT youth (both  males and females) because both groups show significantly higher risk for self-harm behaviors and can  experience unique stressors (e.g., trauma, minority status, family-related stress, and marginalization) that if  addressed using a tailored and adaptive intervention, can contribute to health disparities. We seek to refine the  multicomponent CA CIFFTA treatment so that it includes new psycho-educational modules designed to serve  sexual/gender minority youth. CIFFTA was designed to address the full continuum of unique culture-related  stressor (e.g., acculturation, immigration, discrimination due to race, ethnicity), family conflict and substance  use, and will be enhanced to address unique life stressors (e.g., family and peer rejection due to LGBT  lifestyle, exposure to trauma, and marginalization), and clinical profiles (e.g., depression, emotion  dysregulation). The study investigates the efficacy of a hybrid intervention (face to face and web-based  interventions) delivered to both adolescents and parents when compared to treatment as usual. The adaptive  framework allows the treatment to be systematically tailored to the unique needs of the adolescent/family. The  use of technology helps to avoid some of the logistical barriers to service utilization and makes the intervention  more engaging. The intervention will be refined (content and technology) and then pilot tested with 100 Latino  adolescents 12-18 years of age and their families. Analyses will investigate: 1) the efficacy of the intervention  compared to Treatment As Usual, 2) the linkages between co-existing problem areas (e.g., self-harm, risky  sexual behavior, substance use) to see if there is evidence for a syndemic; and 3) the relationship of culture-  related variables (e.g., acculturation, familism, and Hispanic Stress) to the key factors hypothesized to  contribute to self-harm behavior (i.e., depression, family conflict, substance use, and emotion dysregulation).  The study will utilize a number of measures that are shared across CLaRO studies and will serve as a context  for the mentoring of a young investigator (Dr. Gattamorta) who is seeking to advance her program of research  on family process among Latino gender/minority youth."
"9427202","Project Summary/Abstract Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (?Lupus?) is a systemic autoimmune disease that leads to chronic inflammation in multiple organs including the kidneys. Patients commonly have exacerbations of the disease (kidney nephritis ?flares?) interspersed by quiescent intervals. Early detection and the prompt treatment of flares can have a significant impact on the health and survival of patients, who are disproportionately female, Hispanic, and/or African-American. Biopsy sampling of kidney tissues is the gold standard for Lupus diagnosis, but is invasive and cannot be repeated frequently. In this context, blood or urine biomarkers that are predictive of kidney pathology could be very useful, especially if they supported point-of-care or ideally at-home testing. We have discovered and extensively validated lupus flare-correlated blood and urine diagnostic biomarkers in a protein screen of unprecedented scale, extending across 4 ethnic groups of patients (African American, Caucasian, Hispanic and Chinese). The urine markers perform better than conventional laboratory markers for Lupus and show potential to track with disease activity over time. While urine is an easy sample to give, urine biomarker concentrations must be corrected for their dilution by urine production. The molecule traditionally used for normalizing for urinary dilution, creatinine, is not very compatible with standard immunoassays, but we have identified a protein whose concentration in urine closely correlates with that of creatinine and that can be measured along with the flare markers. A point-of-care (Doctor's office), or better yet, a home self-test, for lupus flares could improve outcomes by expediting treatment. The natural format for such a test would be the lateral-flow assay (LFA), which is widely used as the home pregnancy test. Current LFAs, however, either require expensive equipment or lack the necessary sensitivity and quantitation. We propose to address this problem with smartphone-based LFAs based on our new phosphorescent (?glow-in-the-dark?) nanoparticle reporters. Motivating hypothesis: We hypothesize that the increased sensitivity and quantification ability of nanophosphor-LFAs will enable patients or doctors to simply measure our new kidney nephritis flare biomarkers in urine, and thus, address the unmet need for clinic/home monitoring of lupus nephritis flares. Successful completion of this work also will provide a generally-useful platform technology for quantitative smartphone LFA tests requiring no elaborate phone modifications (only a $10 slide-on attachment), and a new method of urine marker normalization well suited to general use in LFA and ELISA. Specific Aims: We propose: (Aim 1) To develop quantitative LFAs for urinary flare markers and creatinine-correlated normalizing protein; (Aim 2) To integrate multiple marker and normalizing protein tests into a user-friendly system with software error-catching, barcode reading, and quality controls; and finally (Aim 3) To evaluate the performance of the tests in lupus, using urine samples from broad cohorts of patients."
"9514396","Contact PD/PI: DREZNER, MARC K Inst-Career-Dev-001 (011)  I. Institutional Career Development Core Project Summary: The University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) Mentored Clinical Scholars Program (KL2) began in 2007 against a rich university background of superb, graduate-level education and training programs relevant to clinical and translational research. Now entering its tenth year, the KL2 program has an enviable record of achievement by its scholars; of 64 individuals trained, 91% remain in academic positions, 63 extramural grants have been received, and 665 papers have been published. This success is built around the dual institutional and ICTR commitment to provide scholars with the training, mentorship, and protected time necessary to develop an independent research career. The challenge of the coming grant cycle is to maintain this record of success and continue to train future leaders in clinical and translational science in the era of interdisciplinary team science. New NIH requirements and the increased complexity of the program led to the appointment of Manish Shah, MD, MPH, and Anna Huttenlocher, MD, as program Co-Directors, over the past year, and multiple PIs for the KL2 grant. With a highly developed and effective strategy in place for scholar selection, KL2 career development programs will focus on provision of competency-based training that is based upon Individualized Career Development Plans (ICDP). Scholars will be offered both didactic and experiential learning experiences with an emphasis on value-added training. Beyond obligatory components, any needed additional training in research skills will be detailed in the ICDP and various scholars can take advantage of elective courses, MS or Certificate programs in Clinical Investigation, as appropriate. The KL2 Career Development Seminar series exposes scholars to topics in leadership, professional development, interpersonal and professional communication skills, and strategies for engaging community stakeholders in research. In addition, the K2R Seminar Series engages scholars in R- series grant writing, including revisions after actual and mock study section critiques. Woven throughout will be a simultaneous commitment to facilitate productive team science and communicate the value of mentor and mentee training as reflected by the introduction to scholars of self-guided learning modules from the Northwestern University COALESCE project and a comprehensive KL2 Mentoring Program based on the National Research Mentoring Network, respectively. Completely novel in the new grant cycle, Research Externships and Field Experiences will be available relevant to clinical and translational research. Finally, ICTR will continue to work with the UW School of Medicine and Public Health to enhance the recruitment pool for diverse scholars at UW by supporting long-range ?pipeline? programs, targeting diverse faculty recruitment, and creating a diversity friendly research environment.

"9339562","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Peripheral nerve injuries affect hundreds of thousands of Americans every year, including many Veterans. Even though injured nerves can regenerate and reinnervate peripheral targets, complete recovery of normal motor function is unusual. A large majority are left with permanent motor deficits. Inappropriate sensorimotor connections in the spinal cord contribute to these deficits: the spinal reflex circuits that support motor functions such as locomotion are disordered. For example, after peripheral nerve and regeneration, Group IA primary afferent input from muscle spindles no longer strongly excites the spinal motoneurons of homonymous and synergist muscles.  A new therapeutic method that can guide the restoration of appropriate sensorimotor connections in the spinal cord could improve functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. Over the past 30 years, we have developed and applied a unique operant conditioning protocol for inducing activity-dependent CNS plasticity, exploring its mechanisms, and using it therapeutically. This protocol induces activity in descending pathways from the brain that can modify specific spinal reflex pathways, such as the wholly spinal and largely monosynaptic pathway of the H-reflex, the electrical analog of the spinal stretch reflex (i.e., the knee-jerk reflex). In animals or people with incomplete spinal cord injuries that have impaired locomotion, an appropriate reflex conditioning protocol can restore more normal locomotion. Furthermore, recent preliminary data suggest that reflex conditioning can also improve locomotion in rats that have undergone sciatic nerve transection and regeneration.  Based on this work, we hypothesize that an appropriate reflex operant conditioning protocol can improve locomotion after peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we will transect the right sciatic nerve in rats, repair (i.e., reoppose) the nerve so that regeneratin occurs, and assess the impact of up-conditioning (i.e., increasing) or down-conditioning (i.e, decreasing) the right soleus H-reflex. In Aim 1, we will determine the locomotor impact of up- or down-conditioning the soleus H-reflex during the period of sciatic regeneration. In Aim 2, we will determine the locomotor impact of up- or down-conditioning the soleus H-reflex after sciatic regeneration has already occurred. Each aim will study three rat groups: up-conditioned; down-conditioning; and control (i.e., the H-reflex is simply measured). We will assess these groups physiologically (i.e., spontaneous EMG activity, H-reflexes), functionally (i.e., EMG and kinematics during treadmill locomotion), and immunohistochemically (i.e., putative primary afferent terminals (i.e., terminals containing vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGLUT1)) on soleus motoneurons).  At the end of data collection for each aim, we expect that the soleus H-reflex will be larger and locomotion will be better (e.g., longer steps, better right/left symmetryin timing and hip heights) in up- conditioned rats than in control rats or down-conditioned rats. Furthermore, we expect that VGLUT1 (i.e., putative primary afferent terminals) will be more numerous and/or larger on soleus motoneurons of up- conditioned rats.  Thus, this proposal seeks to evaluate a novel and clinically practical therapeutic approach to reducing the functional impairments associated with peripheral nerve injury and regeneration. If this work is successful, it will validate reflex operant conditioning as a new method that can compliment standard rehabilitation regimens and enhance the recovery of useful function after peripheral nerve injury and regeneration; and it will prepare the way for clinical translation of this novel therapy."
"9420331","PROJECT SUMMARY DESCRIPTION: Dementia, especially Alzheimer's dementia (AD), is a growing public health problem with a prevalence of 5M in the US alone (33M worldwide). Despite a decrease in incidence rates, with the aging of the population, the prevalence of dementia is expected to increase to 16M in the US (115M worldwide) with associated costs rising to $1T. Delaying long-term care by 1 month for older Americans would save $60B annually in direct care cost. Efforts to prevent or delay dementia have been largely unsuccessful. However, major depressive disorder in late life (?late-life depression?, LLD) has been identified as one of six treatable risk factors for dementia, especially AD and vascular dementia. The depression-dementia relationship may be magnified in elders who do not respond to antidepressant treatment and experience persistent symptoms. Thus, resolving whether those with treatment-resistant late-life depression (TRLLD) are at higher risk of cognitive decline and progression to dementia compared to those with treatment-responsive LLD is critically important. Leveraging a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded treatment study of N=1500 people with LLD, across 5 sites, we propose to comprehensively delineate neurocognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers associated with progression to dementia in people with persistent LLD (i.e., TRLLD) compared to those whose LLD remits with treatment. We anticipate enrolling 750 elders with LLD and characterizing their symptomatic trajectory over 24 months. We will assess each participant at three time points with neurocognitive and advanced neuroimaging. We hypothesize that changes in executive functions and the executive control network, as well as changes in episodic memory and the default mode/cortico-limbic network, will be greater in those with TRLLD than in those who respond to treatment and stay well. We also hypothesize that changes over two years in executive function and episodic memory will be specifically associated with changes in executive- control and cortico-limbic circuitry, respectively. Based on our recent findings that inflammatory and related molecular markers can differentiate those with neurocognitive impairment and LLD from those with LLD alone, we will build a predictive multivariate model combining baseline neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and plasma protein data to determine who is at greatest risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Finally, we will also explore whether latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms can go beyond the dichotomy of remission/non-remission to identify subsets of elders with LLD at highest risk of cognitive decline, neural circuit change, and progression to dementia. This work will set the stage for neural circuit- targeted preventive care to delay dementia in subsets of older patients with LLD. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting the depression- dementia pathway and reduce suffering for large numbers of elders and their families."

Research Design: This is a prospective, randomized, clinical trial, comparing 2 groups (experimental and control) response to an intervention using disease-specific clinical and humanistic outcomes in adult African- Americans with HIV who also have diabetes and/or hypertension. Aim 1: To investigate the magnitude of improvement in HIV, diabetes and/or hypertension in adult AA. AA with HIV, enrolled from their Community Walgreens pharmacy (1:1, men:women) will receive quarterly HIV- CMTM (intervention) or standard of care (control, no medical information access). Primary health outcome clinical disease markers for HIV (HIV-RNA & CD4), diabetes (HgbA1c & fasting plasma glucose), and hypertension (systolic blood pressure) will be obtained via medical records or point-of-care testing. Improvement as defined by nationally accepted standards for each disease. Aim 2: To determine if HIV-CMTM ameliorates identified causes of health disparities in AA with HIV. Using validated tools at baseline HIV-CMTM assessment, subjects' health literacy and perceptions of stigma, and select individual, interpersonal, and community influences on diseases' control (or lack thereof) will be collected and analyzed for causes of the disparity. Assessments will be repeated biannually during HIV-CMTM visits. Comparisons will be made to see if HIV-CMTM reduces or eliminates over time. Aim 3: To determine factors that can impact the success of the HIV-CMTM intervention when implemented in a real-world setting. Medical providers and research subjects from HIV-CMTM will be invited to participate in focus groups investigating factors influencing acceptance of HIV-CMTM."
"9349485","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hyperkalemia is a common condition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients because of decreased ability of kidney to excrete K as well as the use of inhibitors of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Paleolithic and Mediterranean diets have low Na, high K contents and are well known to be protective against cardiovascular diseases and CKD. However, it remains unclear how the kidneys handle such a high K load in the context of low Na intake. This is crucial to choosing effective diuretics and preventing the drastic consequences of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia for patients on these diets. For instance, our preliminary findings in this proposal suggest that the K-wasting loop diuretics may become K-sparing and decrease K excretion on low Na high K diet. In the thick ascending limb (TAL), Na+, K+, and Cl- are reabsorbed via Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2), and most of the K+ is recycled back into lumen by apical Renal Outer Medullary K channel (ROMK) to facilitate NaCl reabsorption by NKCC2. It has been long understood that the high interstitial K concentration induced by high K diet would inhibit the predominant basolateral K channels, leading to membrane depolarization and inhibition of Cl- exit, and thus inhibit NaCl reabsorption via NKCC2 in the TAL. However, our lab has recently discovered that in mice on a low Na, high K diet (LNaHK), there is a considerable furosemide-sensitive Na+ reabsorption as well as a net K+ secretion in the TAL. Contrary to the traditional view, we have also found that the NKCC2 expression is increased on LNaHK diet. We hypothesize that on LNaHK diet, apical ROMK is upregulated and becomes the predominant K channel which is not affected by high interstitial K+ concentration. NKCC2 is upregulated to supply Na+ to the basolateral Na+-K+ ATPase and bring in more K+ to be secreted. Unlike previous studies, we now have more advanced tools to further investigate the ion transport in TAL such as knockout mice. The hypothesis of this proposal is that the high levels of aldosterone (aldo) and angiotensin II (Ang II) induced by LNaHK diet increase NKCC2 and ROMK activities in the apical membrane of the TAL, thereby causing a net K+ secretion. Two specific aims will investigate the mechanisms that regulate net K secretion in TAL: Specific Aim 1. Determine the role and regulation of NKCC2 in the net K+ secretion in TAL. Specific Aim 2: Determine the role and regulation of ROMK in the net K+ secretion in TAL. We will determine the expression of NKCC2 and ROMK in TAL using western blot and real- time PCR in mice on LNaHK compared to control diet. We will measure the functional activity of NKCC2 and ROMK in TAL using micropuncture, atomic absorptive spectrometry, and patch clamp techniques. We will also perform adrenalectomy (ADX) and use aldosterone (aldo) replacement and inhibitors of renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system to elucidate the regulation of NKCC2 by aldo and Ang II. By fulfilling this proposal, we will have a better understanding of the renal K handling in people on the cardioprotective low Na high K diets."

"9450152","Project Summary/Abstract  The FIU-RCMI Recruitment Core will focus on hiring established health disparities investigators who have existing track  records of independent research support by NIH R-series, P-series, K-series and/or U-series awards, or other federal or  non-federal awards. These new hires will bring their own programs of research to FIU, and will serve as mentors to early  career and minority health disparities investigators affiliated with the FIU-RCMI. The Recruitment Core will develop and  implement (a) search and screen outreach and recruitment strategies that ensure health disparities investigators from  underrepresented backgrounds are part of the pool of applicants, and (b) policies and procedures for allocating up to  $100,000 direct costs per year for up to two years for each newly hired health disparities investigators to augment  institutional support. For the FIU-RCMI to be successful in its research, training, and community engagement goals, we  need a transdisciplinary team of experienced, collaborative-minded, and dedicated health disparities experts. In particular,  experienced investigators from affected racial/ethnic minorities are integral to identify novel and culturally relevant  solutions, and effectively partner with affected communities. Florida International University (FIU) has a number  accomplished investigators currently conducting community-based research on health disparities. However, our research,  training, and community engagement endeavors in health disparities, substance abuse, and HIV will benefit greatly from  the hiring of additional established investigators whose work complements and expands FIU?s current capacity and  expertise."
"9384943","R&R7. Project Summary/Abstract There is a pressing need to better understand specific factors that lead to relapse among individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) in order to improve existing treatments and develop new interventions for this pervasive and costly disorder. While psychological and affective factors have been investigated as predictors of relapse, little is currently known about physiological markers of relapse risk, and most existing research has not taken advantage of newer real-time psychological assessment methods. This investigation is novel in that it will study simultaneously, cognitive factors associated with alcohol relapse such as anxiety and craving, and associated autonomic nervous system processes as they occur in the environment, in order to identify psychological and biological vulnerabilities that may heighten relapse risk for AUD. The study's goal to identify patterns of real-time affect and patterns of affective lability that predict relapse, as well as attendant biomarkers of affect regulation that operate outside of conscious awareness, and thus may add important, objective information about affective regulation that can complement self-report measures in the study of AUD. Further, the training plan outlined in this fellowship will provide the principal investigator with an important set of skills that will grow his capacity to conduct cutting edge research in the areas of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other mental disorders characterized by affect dysregulation. This will be achieved through specialized training in ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a powerful research modality for studying affective and behavioral processes in real time, as individuals interact with their environment. The long-term goal of this program of research and the attendant training plan is to develop integrated biobehavioral treatments for alcohol and other SUDs that address individual vulnerabilities that can undermine individuals' attempts to achieve lasting remission. This study will provide valuable information about the utility and feasibility of applying novel assessment techniques like EMA and ambulatory psychophysiological assessment to the study of addictive disorders, which has the potential to open up new avenues of research.

"9518558","Lack of physical activity is central to numerous health problems. Despite this, we have limited understanding of the molecular components which confer the benefit of physical activity and their diverse impacts across tissues with respect to age, sex, genetics, environment and other objective physiologic, morphometric, and metabolic measures. Identifying these molecular signatures offers to provide new opportunities for treatment and therapeutics. The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assemble a comprehensive map of the molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity and, when possible, relate these changes to the benefits of physical activity. This map will be greatly facilitated by the application of ?omics technologies to identify exercise-responsive genes and to relate their benefits across multiple tissues and contexts. We propose to aid in the construction of this map as the Stanford/Salk MoTrPAC Genome, Epigenome and Transcriptome (GET) Chemical Analysis Center. We will leverage our production and analysis experience to engage in MoTrPAC study design, enable the production of high quality and low cost genomes, epigenomes and transcriptomes and facilitate and engage in bioinformatics analysis with the MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center. Key activities will include coordination and collaboration with all the MoTrPAC sites from tissue management to data delivery. Through these activities we will sequence 3000 genomes and at least 40000 epigenomes and 40000 transcriptomes for samples collected at MoTrPAC animal and human study sites. Our site will engage in multiple levels of quality control from tissue collection to sequence mapping. Generated data in common data formats will be immediately available to MoTrPAC investigators and the Bioinformatics Center through the Google Cloud. In addition, as part of our proposed site, and in coordination with both the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and investigators, we will leverage our expertise in both studies of exosomes and chromatin accessibility sequencing with ATAC-seq to conduct two early pilots that aim to elucidate the systemic and molecular changes in response to physical activity. Additional features of our proposed site are analytical opportunities that include leveraging multiple exercise-related ?omics data sets, such as the DGN study where we have genetic data, transcriptomes and exercise activity recorded for 922 people and have already identified multiple differentially expressed genes and gene-by-environment variants in response to exercise, and diverse and novel -omics methods for gene-by-environment, multi-omics and longitudinal data analysis. Our expectation is that this combination of production experience, exercise-relevant data and novel methods will support diverse and impact research outcomes in the MoTrPAC."
"9409876","Project Summary/Abstract Pharmacological Chaperone Therapy for the GM2Gangliosidoses The ultimate goal of this application is the treatment of Tay-Sachs Disease (TSD) and Sandhoff Disease (SD) collectively called the GM2 Gangliosidoses with a small molecule pharmacological chaperone. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are small molecules that selectively bind and stabilize target proteins to facilitate proper folding, reduce premature degradation and increase the efficiency of ER export. This approach is broadly applicable to diseases where increasing the function of a specific protein (mutant or wild-type) is predicted to provide therapeutic benefit. OT1009 is a potent ?-hexosaminidase (the deficient enzyme in these diseases) targeted pharmacological chaperone with good bioavailability, blood-brain barrier penetration, high selectivity for ?-hexosaminidase and low cytotoxicity. OT1009 treatment increases levels of wild- type and mutant ?-hexosaminidase activity up to 4-fold in cells. OrPhi Therapeutics has developed the only mouse model (?R484Q/?R484Q) in which a pharmacological chaperone therapy can be tested for dosing and efficacy. We intend to use this model to test our pharmacological chaperone OT1009 in long term dosing and efficacy studies. Additionally, we intend to develop a cell based assay that discriminates between OT1009 responsive and non- responsive variants of Hex A and Hex B to determine which Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff Disease patients will be amenable to pharmacological chaperone therapy with OT1009 in future clinical trials. The GM2 Gangliosidoses are life threatening neurodegenerative diseases for which no treatment is currently available. The focus of this work is to provide pre-clinical data to support the development of OT1009 through IND enabling studies and subsequent clinical trials for the GM2 Gangliosidoses."

Health disparities are often systematically linked to social  disadvantage, with socially disadvantaged AA women and children having poorer access to preventive health  care, disproportionately higher rates of secondhand smoke exposure, and lower exposure to smoke-free  policies in the home compared to advantaged groups. There are enormous health care provider and  infrastructure deficits in rural counties in the AR Delta region, yet providers play an important role in motivating  women to implement smoke-free policies in the home to protect their children. Community health workers, who  are from the community, could have a powerful influence on women's adoption processes by increasing the  awareness of the innovation?i.e., smoke-free policies?and persuading them to consider, adopt, and sustain  the innovation. Women caregivers often establish rules for smoking in the home, but the diffusion of evidence-  based tobacco control policies in rural communities has been slow. This mixed-methods study will apply an  implementation framework using the Diffusion of Innovation Theory, Health Belief Model, and Theory of  Reasoned Action to guide the development and implementation of an intervention that aims to increase the  adoption of comprehensive smoke-free policies (ban on cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes, and hookah  and safekeeping products from children) in the homes of socially disadvantaged AA women caregivers aged  18-50 years who live in the AR Delta region. Our transdisciplinary team, the Coalition for a Tobacco Free  Arkansas, Tri-County Rural Health Network, and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, will  implement a small-scale randomized trial that tests the feasibility and compares outcomes for the intervention  group (community health worker + risk communication materials + brief motivational counseling + tobacco  exposure feedback on the child) to those for the control group (risk communication materials) on the primary  outcome, implementation of smoke-free policy in the home, and the secondary outcomes, quitting and smoking  reduction at 3, 6, and 12 months. Our aims are to 1) conduct semi-structured interviews among AA women  caregivers (n = 30) and community health workers (n = 15) to understand multi-level and -domain factors that  influence tobacco use and policy practices; 2) use the interview data to develop, adapt, and pilot test the  intervention prototypes using 6 focus groups of women caregivers (n = 48) and feedback from our Stakeholder  Partnership Board; and 3) assess the influence of the intervention on the study's outcomes (n = 206)."
"9356794","Project 4 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over the last three decades, 5-year survival has improved for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, but long- term survival has not changed and remains at approximately 30% overall. Following surgical cytoreduction, all new patients receive standard primary chemotherapy that includes a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Primary therapy with platinum-based compounds alone produces regression in approximately 70% of ovarian cancers, whereas 42% respond to paclitaxel alone and there is no synergy between the two drugs. Our long- term translational goal is to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. While many investigators have focused on overcoming acquired resistance to taxanes, relatively little attention has been given to enhancing paclitaxel response during primary chemotherapy. Using a functional siRNA screen for kinases that regulate sensitivity to paclitaxel, we found that knockdown of the serine-threonine kinase salt- induced kinase 2 (SIK2) induces polyploidy, inhibits ovarian cancer growth and enhances paclitaxel sensitivity in cell lines and xenografts. SIK2 is required for normal centrosome splitting and is overexpressed in 34% of ovarian cancers of all histotypes, associated with decreased overall survival. During mitosis, SIK2 undergoes autophosphorylation and phosphorylates C-Nap1 a structural protein that mediates centrosome splitting. SIK2 also phosphorylates p85?, driving activation of PI3K, as well as HDAC5, modifying chromatin and DNA repair. We have established a collaboration with Arrien Pharmaceuticals to develop orally administered small molecular weight inhibitors of SIK2: ARN-3236 and ARN-3261 that differ by a single solvent binding substitution. ARN-3236 inhibited growth of 10 ovarian cancer cell lines at an IC50 of 0.8 to 2.6 ?M, where the IC50 of ARN-3236 was inversely correlated with endogenous SIK2 expression (Pearson?s r = -0.642, P = 0.03). ARN-3236 also enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel in 8 of 10 cell lines, as well as in SKOv3ip (P = 0.028) and OVCAR8 xenografts. ARN-3236 uncoupled the centrosome from the nucleus in interphase, blocked centrosome separation in mitosis, caused prometaphase arrest and induced apoptotic cell death as well as tetraploidy. ARN-3236 also inhibited AKT phosphorylation and attenuated survivin expression. ARN-3261 enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel and cisplatin in xenograft models and exhibited little toxicity, as well as greater resistance to PgP and13-fold greater potency than ARN-3236. We will pursue three aims: 1) to perform a phase I trial of the SIK2 inhibitor ARN-3261 alone (IA) and in combination with weekly paclitaxel (IB) measuring pharmacokinetics of ARN-3261 and paclitaxel, predictive (SIK2) and pharmacodynamic (pSIK2 and pHDAC5) biomarkers, as well as levels of polyploidy, pAKT, survivin and biomarkers for apoptosis; 2) to determine whether the SIK2 inhibitor ARN-3261 enhances response to carboplatin/paclitaxel and carboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin in ovarian cancer cell line-derived and patient-derived xenografts; and 3) to identify targets that produce synthetic lethality in ovarian cancer cells treated with SIK2 inhibitors."

"9543119","Abstract Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are critical regulators of cell death in response to multiple stimuli, including engagement of the Fas death receptor (FasR). Our past work on this project discovered that the FasR directly engages and activates components of the T cell receptor complex to elicit apoptotic calcium release from IP3R channels. More recently, we demonstrated that very rapid Fas-dependent palmitoylation of the Src kinase Lck is essential for recruiting this protein into lipid rafts and initiating Fas-dependent calcium release and cell death. Surprisingly, Lck was depalmitoylated with equally rapid kinetics in the continued presence of Fas ligand. The kinetics of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation was temporally consistent with the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins such as phospholipase C gamma-1. Thus, we propose that palmitoylation is functionally analogous to phosphorylation and is responsible for the rapid recruitment and assembly of the FasR macromolecular signaling complex. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dynamic and highly regulated lipidation of multiple signaling proteins is essential for signaling through the FasR. This hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine if rapid stimulus-dependent palmitoylation/depalmitoylation of components of the Fas signaling pathway contributes to apoptotic calcium release. We will exploit our recently developed and highly sensitive pulse labeling technique using alkyne lipids combined with acyl-biotin exchange to determine dynamic changes in the palmitoylated proteins after Fas stimulation. Aim 2 will determine how palmitoylation is enzymatically regulated after Fas stimulation. We will develop new methodological approaches to determine how the palmitoylating enzyme DHHC21and the expanding family of depalmitoylating enzymes are regulated during Fas stimulation. In Aim 3 we will determine if the DHHC21 mutant mouse depilated (dep) has deficits in T cell function in vitro and in vivo. We will evaluate T cell differentiation and function in dep mice and determine whether palmitoylation of FasR-associated proteins and downstream signaling are compromised in these mice. Together, the proposed studies will likely lead to new insights into the dynamic regulation of protein function by lipidation. Furthermore, these studies highlight an entirely new class of signaling proteins regulating T cell function which are potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with altered T cell homeostasis such as autoimmunity and cancer."
"9418236","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite the 11.4 million Mexican immigrants living in the U.S., the biological and behavioral determinants that contribute to cancer disparities among them are vastly understudied. While research has indicated that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) influence cancer in adulthood, this association has not been investigated among Mexican immigrants. In addition, exposure to minority stress is associated with poor physical adult health outcomes. This association is particularly important for Mexican immigrants, as they are exposed to a disproportionate number of stressors associated with their minority status that are stigmatizing and discriminatory. It is believed that minority-related stressors are unique (i.e., not experienced by non- stigmatized populations), additive, chronic, and socially based. The repeated or chronic stress of ACE, such as living in poverty, or ongoing adult experiences associated with minority stress, such as pressure to acculturate, can lead to dysregulation of biological systems and harmful health behaviors. Biological and behavioral stress responses, such as the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, elevated adiposity, alcoholism, and risky sexual activity are associated with cancer development in adulthood. The goal of this study is to evaluate the association of ACE, minority stress and their combination with cancer risk factors among Mexican immigrants. This study will pursue three primary aims: (1) Evaluate cancer risk factors in relation to the adversity that occurred in childhood; (2) Evaluate cancer risk factors in adulthood in relation to minority stress; and (3) Determine the extent to which biological and behavioral cancer risk factors increase as a result of the additive effect of ACE and minority stress in adulthood. This proof-of-concept study will enroll 50 Mexican immigrants (aged 19-49 years) who reside in the Houston area. The ACE survey will be used to retrospectively measure stress during childhood, and the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Inventory (MASI) will be used to measure minority stress. Direct assessment will be used to measure 11 pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, and TNF?) and three adiposity measures (body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference).This study is highly innovative for three primary reasons: (1) It focuses on a population that experiences cancer disparities but is rarely included in interdisciplinary research; (2) It uses an interdisciplinary framework that embeds Cumulative Risk Theory and Minority Stress Theory into a Life Course Perspective to understand the impact of social stress on cancer risk; and (3) It uses multiple biological and behavioral measurements to provide a more complete understanding of how stress influences cancer risk. It is envisioned that this study will expand an interdisciplinary research program aimed at investigating biological and behavioral influences on cancer risk factors. The findings from the proof-of-concept study will be used to help design a larger scale study that will advance research and modify cancer prevention strategies."

"9549177","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein design is a rigorous test of our understanding of protein folding and stability, and a variety of design methods have been used to create proteins that have valuable applications in research and medicine. Almost all efforts in de novo protein design have been focused on creating idealized proteins composed of canonical structural elements. Examples include the design of coiled-coils, up-down helical bundles, and ?/? proteins with very short connections between the secondary structural elements. These studies are excellent for exploring the minimal determinants of protein structure, but idealized structures may not be the most effective starting points for engineering novel protein functions. Functional sites in proteins are often located in pockets, grooves or loops that are created from assemblies of secondary structure that are not forming canonical or symmetric patterns. Here, we propose to create and test a computer-based strategy for designing proteins, called SEWING, that is not focused on creating a particular idealized structure, but rather can produce a diverse array of structures that all meet a set of predefined requirements. For instance, in one of our specific aims we will require that all the designs contain functional EF-hand calcium-binding sites, but beyond this requirement there will not be predefined goals for the final tertiar structures of the proteins. With SEWING, tertiary structures are assembled from structural motifs found in naturally occurring proteins. Motifs can be continuous or discontinuous in primary sequence, and generally contain two or three elements of secondary structure. Motifs are stitched together by superimposing regions of structural similarity in two motifs. Advantages of this approach include the use of building blocks that are inherently designable and the ability to incorporate functional motifs from naturally occurring proteins, for instance protein and ligand binding sites. To explore the utility of SEWING we will pursue several design goals including: the creation of helical bundles with diverse structural features such as clefts and binding pockets, embedding functional motifs in proteins to create protein binders, and creating proteins that contain multiple binding sites."

"9482549","Project Summary Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and disproportionate rate of HIV infection and more than half of all HIV+ individuals are GBM. Improving viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV. Moreover, research is needed to better understand the modifiable social and behavioral factors that influence their long-term health. Chronic experiences of sexual minority stressors (e.g., internalized homonegativity) have been shown to influence a variety of mental, behavioral, and physical health outcomes for GBM, including general stress (e.g., cortisol) and immune (e.g., cytokines) outcomes, as well as HIV-specific health outcomes (e.g., CD4 count) among HIV+ GBM. Chronic experiences of HIV-related stressors have also been shown to impact mental health and health behaviors for HIV+ GBM, though there is substantially less research on their role in the health of HIV+ GBM. Previous research, including our own, has shown that fluctuations in sexual minority and HIV-specific stressors (i.e., acute experiences of these stressors) are measurable and meaningfully associated with health outcomes. Both HIV infection and substance use are associated with declines in neurocognitive function and emerging evidence suggests that emotional processing may help explain the impact of psychological phenomena on health outcomes. To develop interventions that are robust and durable, research is needed that examines the unique and overlapping influence of sexual minority and HIV-related stressors on health outcomes for HIV+ GBM within a unified biopsychosocial model. Such a model should take into account both individual-level (i.e., chronic) and situational (i.e., acute) experiences of these stressors to examine their independent associations with health, and should consider whether emotional interference in cognitive processing might moderate these associations. Aim 1 of the study is to test a biopsychosocial model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress and health, examining direct and indirect effects of these stressors on each outcome. Aim 2 is to test the moderating role of emotional interference in cognitive processing on these associations. Finally, Aim 3 is to examine the extent of intraindividual variability over one year in sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, VL, CD4, and cytokines. Although not an aim, the study will culminate in the development of guidelines for future intervention development and we will gather participant feedback on these recommendations. To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 250 HIV+ GBM and follow them for 12 months. We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over one year to test the impact of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on physiological stress (diurnal cortisol) and long-term immune outcomes (VL suppression, CD4 count, cytokines). This study will address novel questions about the relative role of sexual minority and HIV-related stress in the health of HIV+ GBM to guide the development of interventions to improve health and reduce HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality among HIV+ GBM."
"9398221","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In sub-Saharan Africa, cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death, with 68,000 new cases detected each year, and a high percentage remaining undiagnosed. In the United States (U.S), an introduction of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, a low-cost early detection procedure, has resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer. However, African immigrant women (AIW), a fast-growing immigrant population in the US, face a disproportionate burden of disease, and their worse cancer outcomes have been attributed to low Pap testing. Studies of other immigrant groups such as Asians and Hispanics, have shown that limited health literacy, the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions, is associated with poor cancer screening. However, there is a dearth of research on how this phenomenon presents among AIW, and the pathways by which health literacy impacts Pap testing are unclear. Within the African cultural context, informal communication methods are used to disseminate women?s health information, and may play a crucial role in influencing health literacy. Therefore, sources (family/relatives, friends, ethnic church, TV/Radio, internet, social media, physician) and types (verbal, written text, pictures) of health information exchange are suggested as possible mechanism by which health literacy is influenced and health behavior such as Pap testing are adopted. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to understand how sources and types of health information impact health literacy and ultimately, Pap testing behaviors among AIW in the US. The study will address these specific aims: (1) Examine the relationships of the number of sources and types of health information with the level of health literacy among AIW; (2) Examine the mechanism through which sources and types of health information and health literacy impact Pap testing behaviors among AIW; (3) Explore how sources of health information influence AIW Pap testing behaviors and how they seek health information using open-ended interviews; (4) Describe how sources/types of health information impact health literacy and information sharing to guide Pap testing. The project is guided by an adapted Health Literacy Skills framework, a conceptual model which addresses the determinants of health literacy, and the relationship between health literacy and Pap testing. A comprehensive and disease specific instrument validated in immigrant populations will be the primary measure of health literacy. This study is aligned with the NCI strategic mission to improve health outcomes among minority populations. This training plan will begin a program of research to understand the complex interaction among health literacy, culture, and psychosocial determinants of Pap testing. This study will inform the development of culturally tailored interventions to promote Pap testing to help decrease the burden of cervical cancer and cancer disparities among underserved African immigrant women."
"9464014","We have developed a chemically-controlled ultra-long acting delivery system to support once- weekly to once-monthly administration of peptides. In this system, the peptide is covalently attached to a hydrogel microsphere depot by a cleavable ?-eliminative linker; upon subcutaneous injection, the linker slowly cleaves and releases the drug. If the same linker is used to attach two different peptides to microspheres, they will be released at the same rate; the relative amounts released can be controlled by the relative amounts attached to the microspheres. Hence, this delivery system should be capable of coordinating the pharmacokinetics of ?dual-agonists?. This Phase I proposal seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a two-drug delivery system to coordinate the pharmacokinetics of two peptide therapeutics. We will attach both the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide and a newly discovered glucagon agonist to our hydrogel- microspheres using a single linker having a half-life of about one week. After subcutaneous injection of the microspheres in the mouse, we will determine the pharmacokinetics of both these peptides. Concurrently, we will utilize the DIO mice as a model for obesity, and attempt to demonstrate the efficacy of the dual agonist as an anti-obesity drug, as well as the optimal ratio of the two drugs."
"9466075","Project summary  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that is based on the application of a weak, high frequency electrical current to a muscle and the measurement of the resulting surface voltages. The further development and application of EIM remains the main business focus of Skulpt, Inc, a small business concern based in Boston and San Francisco (Specific Aims just say San Francisco). Alterations to the condition of the muscle, including myocyte atrophy, fat and connective tissue deposition, and inflammation all alter the EIM data in predictable and consistent ways. To date, through Skulpt, EIM has been applied as a potential biomarker for assessing disease progression and response to therapy in a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as other disorders that impact muscle condition, such as disuse atrophy and sarcopenia (age related muscle loss); over 1000 people have been studied with Skulpt?s EIM technology. Whereas the results of these applications are promising, the analytic approaches taken to the data sets have been fairly basic, utilizing only simple single frequency or simplistic multifrequency values. However, with every single muscle measurement, over 240 individual data points are acquired at different frequencies, different depths of muscle penetration, and at different angles to the major muscle fiber direction. Moreover, each of the above studies has been done in isolation, and thus how results differ between diseases is unknown. Given the plethora of data, applying more sophisticated analytic approaches has the potential of yielding improved EIM measures. Moreover, collaborators have already collected an associated wealth of animal EIM data that will help further inform this analysis. Thus, in this proposed Phase 1 SBIR, we plan to apply a variety of data mining techniques to the vast set of data already accumulated at Skulpt, Inc such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed and implemented. In Specific Aim 1, we will study human data across all disease types evaluated to determine which data sets are most effective at discriminating diseased from healthy muscle as well as distinguishing between diseases. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on finding the metrics that are most sensitive to the degree of muscle pathology in a specific disease. In both of these aims, we will evaluate how these new metrics are mirrored in already obtained animal data. In Specific Aim 3, we will study these metrics in a new set of data (a test set) that was not used to develop the analytical paradigms so as to ensure their robustness. With the conclusion of this work, we will plan to pursue a Phase 2 SBIR that will focus on the development of a software suite to assist in EIM data interpretation based upon these results followed by a prospective observational clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of these newly developed metrics for disease diagnosis and tracking of progression/response to therapy."
"9561232","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Mechanisms (CM)  The goal of the Cancer Mechanisms (CM) Program is to elucidate and characterize cellular/molecular  pathways that present opportunities to prevent cancer and to improve cancer classification and treatment. The  research interests of the program faculty range from fundamental pathway discovery in model organisms,  biochemical and cell biological approaches to understanding cell cycle and self-renewal, to elucidation of  genetic pathways that present opportunities for improved cancer diagnosis, classification, prevention, and  treatment. Furthermore, new members focusing on bioinformatic and proteomic approaches to cancer have  enhanced our intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic collaborative opportunities. The CM program  currently has 22 members from 9 different departments whose research is organized into several overlapping  themes: 1) cell division and cancer, 2) gene expression and cancer, 3) cancer cell biology including,  metastasis and vascular biology, and 4) bioinformatic approaches to cancer. Diversity in the research  approaches and backgrounds of investigators in the CM program also is accompanied by significant overlap  between research themes, with clinical experience and observations informing basic science approaches, and  discoveries in biochemical and genetic model systems being translated to clinical trials. The Co-Directors  represent both ends of the basic and clinical research spectrum and leverage their diverse experience to  enhance collaborations through activities that include recruitment of new members, organizing specialized  regional symposia, attracting outside high-profile seminar speakers, and organizing regular programmatic  meetings, retreats and ad-hoc technical workshops; with the goal of enhancing members' cancer-oriented  research and facilitating collaborative projects. These activities have resulted in a strong collaborative group;  as evidenced by the intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic joint grants, cancer clinical trials translating  CM science themes, and publications. The program is a generator of discoveries of novel targets, pathways  and mechanisms to be studied in the clinic. The success of CM investigators was enabled by the NCCC  through the successful strategic recruitment of outstanding new faculty in the Bioinformatics theme (Cheng,  Greene), Pathology (Stan), Proteomics (Kettenbach), and in clinical/translational investigations (Dragnev [CE]),  the support of shared resources, and the provision of pilot funding. More than 271 cancer-related manuscripts  have been published over the reporting period (86 [32%] appearing in high-impact journals), many of them  representing intra-program (26=10%) or inter-program (76=28%) collaborations. Intra-programmatic involve all  22 CM program members, with 17 co-authors with other NCCC members, including several other programs,  particularly ICI, MT, and CE. Total funding for the program is currently $5.6M, of which $5.4M is peer-reviewed,  and $1.8 is from NCI."

There is a persistent and troubling gap between the production of  health science research and its dissemination, translation and eventual uptake and use by relevant  stakeholders. When it comes to the issue of health inequities, closing the gap between research and practice is  all the more urgent, in the face of enduring disparities, particularly among communities of color. While there  has been some progress in reducing health disparities among racial groups, inequalities in many health  outcomes have actually increased in Chicago. Thus, the translation of research findings into sustainable  community and systems-level changes, which will address, mitigate, and ultimately prevent health inequities  and structural violence, is especially significant in Chicago. To accomplish this goal we propose the following  aims: Aim 1: Coordinate, monitor and evaluate community engagement and dissemination activities across the  Administrative Core, the Investigator Development Core, and all research projects. Aim 2: In collaboration  with four community dissemination partners, develop dissemination strategies and products, and provide  community-based venues for community engagement and dissemination activities Aim 3: Develop and guide a  dissemination seed grant program for community-based partners to promote community-responsive research  products, and facilitate contextually relevant dissemination activities across sectors."

"9516675","Abstract Many mammalian organs (skin, stomach, intestines, colon, and eye) possess a source of adult stem cells that continually replenishes their rapidly self-renewing epithelial surface. The limbus contains a small subpopulation of rare limbal stem cells (LSC) that continually repopulates the corneal epithelium. Patients with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) are unable to regenerate the corneal epithelium, resulting in conjunctivalization of the corneal stroma that triggers neovascularization, chronic inflammation, and ultimately blindness due to an irreversibly opaque cornea. Several approaches have been used to replace LSC by transplanting limbal tissue or ex vivo expanded limbal cells. These procedures have obtained some success, mainly using autologous limbal tissue from patients with unilateral LSCD. Patients with bilateral LSCD have no source of autologous LSC and much less success was observed with allogeneic limbal tissue transplants. However, success of all these procedures was severely limited by the inability to prospectively identify and purify LSC. This problem was recently addressed by the three PIs of this proposal, who discovered that the ABCB5 gene, a new member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of active transporters, is expressed by stem cells of the limbus. Normal function of ABCB5+ LSC is required for corneal development and repair, through critical roles in stem cell maintenance and survival, and knockout mice that lack ABCB5 do not develop a fully differentiated mature corneal epithelium. Importantly, ABCB5 is a cell surface protein and specific monoclonal antibodies developed by the laboratories of Co-PIs Drs. M. Frank and N. Frank are capable of isolating pure ABCB5-positive cells from the limbus. Transplantation of purified human ABCB5+ (but not ABCB5-) LSC onto the corneal stroma of immunodeficient mice with induced LSCD restored the corneal epithelium, indicating that this purified LSC population has the potential to significantly improve therapy for corneal disease associated with LSCD. Our currently funded RO1 project builds upon these results to address the important challenges that prevent successful stem cell therapy for patients with unilateral or bilateral LSCD, with the overall hypothesis that ABCB5+ stem cells from the limbus can be isolated and expanded ex vivo as a source of stem cells to regenerate the corneal epithelium when transplanted to recipients with either a unilateral or bilateral LSCD. This supplemental grant application is based upon early results of this project demonstrating that human ABCB5+ LSC can be expanded in vitro for use as successful pure stem cells grafts in pre-clinical therapeutic transplantation models. With supplemental funding, we wish now to focus on furthering these results with a view towards advancing ABCB5+ LSC transplantation to clinical testing, through (1) conducting GMP-conforming pilot production of in vitro-expanded LSC for IND-enabling studies, and (2) using GMP-produced in vitro-expanded LSC for initial preclinical IND-enabling studies (pharmacology/efficacy and mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics/biodistribution, toxicology, and carcinogenicity)."

Designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center in 1974, the past five years have been a period of significant growth and restructuring. Dr. Thomas Lynch became the 6th Director of the YCC in April 2009 and recruited more than 80 new basic, population, translational and clinical scientists. In addition to appointing a new Deputy Director, Dr. Daniel DiMaio, Senior Leadership and cancer Center Administration was completely redesigned. For this submission 6 of 7 Research Programs are under new leadership. During the most recent funding period, the YCCs 260 members published 2751 articles, (21% intra-programmatic and 14% inter-programmatic) and hold $93M in total cancer funding (including $29M from NCI). Accrual to therapeutic clinical trials more than doubled over the past year. Driven by remarkable institutional support, significant expansion during the prior funding period included building the $450M Smilow Cancer Hospital, opening 7 regional Care Centers in Southern CT and acquiring the former Hospital St. Raphael to create the nation's 4th largest hospital. This clinical care expansion was matched by establishing the Yale Cancer Biology Institute at Yale's West Campus. A detailed strategic planning process has begun with a resultant strong emphasis on optimizing our research programs and shared resources and investing in translational research, cancer genetics, and tumor immunology. This 5-year request is to support an organizational framework that promotes and fosters basic and translational cancer research. The 7 Research Programs include: Cancer Genetics and Genomics, Cancer Immunology, Cancer Prevention and Control, Developmental Therapeutics, Molecular Virology, Radiobiology and Radiotherapy and Signal Transduction. Support is requested for 8 Shared Resources including Yale Center for Genome Analysis, Flow Cytometry, Yale Pathology Tissue Services, Cesium Irradiator, Rapid Case Ascertainment, Yale Center for Molecular Discovery, Biostatistics and the Clinical Trials Office. To support center goals and objectives support for Senior Leadership, Planning and Evaluation, Administration, and Developmental Funds is also requested."
"9358324","Project Summary | Function and activity dynamics of lateral hypothalamic glutamatergic neurons in obesity The underlying physiological mechanisms contributing to the obese state are largely unknown. Appetitive and consummatory behaviors, which are thought to be dysregulated in obesity, are governed by descending signals from the brain, but how specific neural circuits regulate such behaviors is unclear. One brain area that is hypothesized to be a critical component in the circuitry that orchestrates feeding behavior is the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), a molecularly and functionally heterogeneous hypothalamic region that is interconnected with limbic and hindbrain structures. Recently developed circuit dissection tools have made it possible to study the function of molecularly defined neuron populations. One population of particular importance to feeding behavior is the putative glutamatergic, Vglut2-expressing neurons of the LHA (LHA-Vglut2), which are known to be involved in controlling food intake and reward seeking. Yet, how these neurons orchestrate feeding behavior and how they might contribute to obesity is unknown. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to use contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry that allows the LHA to control food intake. Here I propose to identify the natural activity dynamics and the function of LHA-Vglut2 neurons in regulating voluntary, consummatory behavior. The natural activity dynamics of LHA-Vglut2 neurons will be measured using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging during consummatory behaviors, and the sufficiency of these neurons to inhibit consumption will be tested using cell-type specific optogenetic stimulation (Aim 1). Furthermore, the activity dynamics of LHA-Vglut2 neurons will be monitored during the gradual transition to obesity induced by chronic consumption of calorie dense food. Following diet-induced obesity, LHA-Vglut2 neurons will be selectively activated with chemogenetic tools to suppress food consumption and mitigate obesity (Aim 2). Based on my preliminary data and published work by my sponsor and others, I hypothesize that LHA-Vglut2 activity represents a negative feeding signal, which serves to suppress food intake. When mice are fasted, basal dynamics are suppressed and consumption-evoked responses are reduced. I predict that activation of these neurons will rapidly abolish consummatory behavior. During high fat diet-induced obesity, the LHA- Vglut2 response will be downregulated. I hypothesize that this downregulation can be reversed by chemogenetic activation of LHA-Vglut2 neurons, thereby restoring normal behavior. Regardless of the results, these experiments will identify, for the first time, natural activity dynamics of LHA-Vglut2 neurons and how they are altered by obesity."
"9406584","Project Summary/Abstract Severe/exacerbation-prone asthma remains a major problem with significant morbidity and mortality despite the development of new targeted therapies. The goal of the NHLBI?s Precision Interventions for Severe and Exacerbation Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network is to conduct sequential, adaptive, clinical trials with precision interventions in stratified patient populations, utilizing patient phenotypes/endotypes. We hypothesize that a biomarker-directed approach, applied in an adaptive trial, can be used to define phenotypic/endotypic features of severe/exacerbation-prone asthma, predict response to specific precision interventions, and be useful in selecting one precision intervention therapy over another. We thus propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Conduct a sequential, adaptive clinical trial with the PrecISE Network for adults and adolescents with severe/exacerbation-prone asthma, utilizing currently available patient phenotypes/endotypes, and monitoring biomarkers to validate their utility in predicting response to precision intervention strategies including anti-IL5, anti-IL4/13, anti-IgE, and anti IL6. 2. Demonstrate that a biomarker-driven strategy utilizing blood eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide and plasma IL6 or CRP levels, applied in a hierarchical manner with an adaptive design, can be used to select the best precision intervention for a patient with a specific phenotype/endotype. 3. Evaluate next generation biomarkers (including cytokine profiling, RNA seq, pathway analysis, and expression of steroid response genes in blood, sputum and/or nasal brushings) as predictors of response to specific asthma interventions. We propose an 800-subject clinical trial that uses a sequential, adaptive trial design model to select precision interventions, including anti-IL5, anti-IL4/13, anti-IgE and anti-IL6, in severe/exacerbation-prone asthma patients with specific endotypes. We will explore current biomarkers (including blood eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, serum IL-6, CRP), applied in a hierarchical approach, as well as next generation biomarkers. We will determine whether a change in a designated biomarker will be associated with a response to the precision intervention therapy. For those who fail to respond to our interventions, we will obtain chest/sinus CT scans and bronchoscopy with biopsy and lavage to define tissue-specific strategies for precision interventions. We will leverage the experience and established clinical trial program of the Denver site with expertise in phenotyping/endotyping, biomarker development, and analytic approach, to meet our ultimate goals of using adaptive trial design as a model for clinical care, to fill the gap in managing severe/exacerbation-prone asthma and defining a new generation of biomarkers based on assessment of individual treatment response and failure within the study population."
"9410153","Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the US and plays a major role in the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There remains a very significant need for better treatments. While current weight loss agents act by suppressing appetite, strategies that can safely enhance energy expenditure have the potential to effectively treat obesity. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic tissue that uniquely expresses mitochondrial UnCoupling Protein-1 (UCP1). This protein dissipates, in a regulated fashion, the electrochemical gradient in the mitochondria of brown adipocytes as heat, and thus plays an important role in the maintenance of body temperature and energy balance. BAT is a flexible tissue that normally enlarges or atrophies over time depending on environmental temperature. In numerous animal models, enhancement of BAT mass has been shown to cause weight loss and diabetes resistance. While BAT was until recently thought to be insignificant in adult humans, data obtained in the past several years with PET imaging show that adults in fact have significant amounts of functional BAT, and that the amount of BAT in individuals is strongly correlated with leanness. Furthermore, the genetic locus most tightly linked with human obesity (FTO) was recently shown to cause defective recruitment of new brown adipocytes. Until recently no brown adipocyte stem cell had been identified. We discovered human skeletal muscle- resident brown adipocyte progenitor cells that under appropriate conditions become fully functional brown adipocytes, expressing high levels of UCP1 and having a very high metabolic rate. Using these progenitors we identified a protein factor that is secreted by brown adipocytes and in turn promotes the recruitment of additional brown adipocytes in culture. A slightly truncated version of this protein with a somewhat longer circulating half-life, which is already marketed for an unrelated acute indication, was tested in Diet-Induced Obese (DIO) mice, a highly predictive animal model for human obesity and insulin resistance. Marked decreases in body weight and body fat, as well as improvements in glucose metabolism were observed in a 28-day study. However, the still relatively short plasma half-life of the tested agent requires that it be injected at least every other day, a major challenge for a chronic metabolic disease indication. In the proposed work, we therefore aim to generate protein analogs with significantly extended plasma half- life that show similar or better efficacy in DIO mice. Such a compound could be administered once weekly or less frequently. We will evaluate protein yield (manufacturability), confirm the activity of the analogs in vitro, and determine their plasma half-life in mice. Those compounds with the best profile will be tested for efficacy in DIO mice. If this work is successful, we plan to rapidly move to select a lead and backup compound and initiate IND-enabling studies with a novel, brown fat-recruiting product candidate for the treatment of obesity and diabetes."

"9547962","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) must undergo extensive co- transcriptional processing in the nucleus before they can be exported to the cytoplasm and function as mRNAs. The processing events include 5??-end capping, splicing, and 3??- end cleavage and polyadenylation. The 3'-end processing of most pre-mRNAs requires a large number of protein factors for its execution, including cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage factors I and II, and poly(A) polymerase (PAP). The 3'-end processing machinery in yeast has similarity to that in mammals, although there are also significant differences. Replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop near their 3??- end and employ a distinct machinery for its processing, although it shares some protein factors with the canonical pre-mRNA 3??-end processing machinery. mRNA 5??-end capping occurs early during transcription by RNA polymerase II, and it was generally believed that capping always proceeds to completion. We have recently discovered that the Rai1/DXO family of proteins are part of a mRNA capping quality surveillance mechanism. They can possess RNA 5??-end pyrophosphohydrolase (PPH) and decapping activities, and help remove incompletely capped mRNAs from cells. Despite the extensive studies on these mRNA processing and quality control factors, significant gaps remain in our knowledge of their molecular mechanisms of action. We will carry out structural studies on the protein factors and their complexes, and assess the structural observations by careful biochemical and functional experiments. The proposed project will greatly enhance our understanding of these important events in mRNA lifecycle."
"9461800","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE."
"9370751","ABSTRACT Mounting evidence suggests that autoantibodies can antecede overt clinical disease, with anti-SSA/Ro among the earliest reactivities. Yet, predicting who remains protected from overt disease or who will progress would be a game-changing discovery for understanding the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Mothers in the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus (RRNL) represent a unique population at risk for overt clinical autoimmunity. Despite the presence of high titer anti-Ro antibodies potentially pathogenic to the developing fetus, many women are asymptomatic, with autoimmunity identified solely based on disease in their offspring. Currently, of 521 RRNL mothers, 283 were asymptomatic, or had only minimal symptoms, at the time of the birth of the NL child, whereas a subset developed SLE. The intertwining of genetic variation in the HLA locus with the capacity to undergo shifts toward a pathologic gut microbiome may, in part, explain progression from benign to pathologic autoimmunity and overt SLE. Alternatively, other HLA variants may instead associate with a protective microbiome that halts progression so that a state of benign autoimmunity persists. In Specific Aim 1, associations will be sought between host genetics and anti-Ro NL disease status. We will genotype an estimated 297 RRNL mothers using an HLA next generational sequencing approach that makes no a priori sequence assumptions. The HLA alleles will be informative to distinguish asymptomatic anti-Ro-mothers (particularly those remaining so for >6 years) from those who initially or quickly progressed to classified SLE. In Specific Aim 2, associations will be sought between gut microbiome taxa in the context of HLA and anti-Ro NL maternal disease status, as we address the hypothesis that HLA is a central driver of pathobiont associations that contribute to the pathogenesis of overt SLE. A planned longitudinal analysis of the asymptomatic RRNL mothers will be highly informative and expected to capture women who transition to established SLE. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the relationships of serological and cellular immunity (and CD4 T-cell subsets) and anti-Ro NL maternal disease status. Newly generated data will be continuously shared and discussed with Drs. Silverman (Project 2) and Reizis (Project 3) to further explore associations in the context of circulating and fecal IgA and anti-DNASE1L3 sensitive reactivity with microparticles. A molecular basis for the specific microbial taxa that are coated with sIgA will be evaluated in context of a mimicry hypothesis that considers cross-reactivity between T cell epitopes and bacterial peptides. From a public health perspective, it is anticipated that conserved patterns or blueprints will be identified for host immune systems that are best suited to arrest autoimmunity at a benign preclinical state or conversely that favor progression to overt SLE and tissue injury. Identification of one or more predictive biomarkers that associate with a persistently asymptomatic state could also serve as the ?target to achieve? while a permissive factor might represent a ?target to inhibit? in an established SLE patient."
"9469835","Abstract Porphyrias are genetic disorders caused by mutations in enzymes involved in eight sequential biosynthetic conversions that combine glycine and succinyl coenzyme-A to generate heme. Porphyrin accumulation can result in `secondary porphyrias' in association with other diseases such as hepatitis C virus infection. Current major unmet needs with regard to the porphyria disorders are our present limited understanding of the molecular triggers of porphyria acute attacks, aside from indirect association with fever or drugs; the reasons why some individuals develop significant end-organ complications such as the need for liver or bone marrow transplantation while others do not; and importantly the limited availability of drugs to treat the different porphyrias. Our central hypothesis is that proteotoxic porphyrin-mediated damage, coupled with modifier effects, contributes to the cellular damage and morbidity that is associated with porphyrias. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (i) Define the mechanism of porphyria-induced protein aggregation; (ii) Characterize potential modifiers that promote or protect from porphyria-induced injury in cell culture and animal models; and (iii) Use zebrafish porphyria models to screen and characterize small- molecule compounds that prevent tissue porphyrin accumulation. We have assembled extensive preliminary results to support the likely success of our aims, including substantial evidence for porphyrin-mediated protein aggregation that is dependent on the mode of porphyrin accumulation, evidence for fatty acid binding protein- 1 as a modulator of porphyrin-mediated cell and liver injury, and two novel acute zebrafish porphyria models we generated that are amenable to high-throughput drug screening with potential positive compounds that we propose to validate and characterize. Completion of our proposed aims should provide fundamental knowledge regarding how porphyrins cause protein aggregation, the subcellular compartments that are involved, whether such aggregation is due to direct covalent porphyrin-protein adduct formation, and the mechanism of aggregate turnover. We also anticipate being able to characterize specific porphyrin-binding proteins that regulate the propensity to accumulate porphyrins in cells and tissues. This could provide potential clues as to why some individuals with porphyria develop end-stage liver disease in the absence of concomitant underlying liver disorders, while other patients are spared serious liver-related complications. Importantly, we anticipate that our proposal will allow us to use two powerful novel acute porphyria zebrafish models we have developed to identify potential compounds that may ultimately have therapeutic utility. This proposal uses state-of-the-art technologies, multiple biochemical and animal model tools including zebrafish and mice, and introduces the novel concept of proteotoxicity as an alternative mechanism for porphyria exacerbations and progression."
"9565010","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to use single-molecule spectroscopy imaging simultaneously with single-channel current recording to interrogate the dynamics in the conformational motions of a single ion-channel, to better understand the mechanism of channel function at the cell membranes. To meet a major methodology and technical need and challenge in the medical life sciences, the primary goal of our proposal is to solve a critical problem that holds understanding ion channel protein biological function and dynamics over the last four decades ever since the patch-clamp electrophysiological technique demonstrated. Specifically, we propose to conduct a systematic technical development and demonstration. Our project consists of three primary aims: (1) Achieve an experimental understanding of the sub-unit conformational changes that control the open-close activity of the NMDA receptor; (2) Resolve the conformational changes of the NMDA receptor in desensitization and inactivation; and (3) Demonstrate high time resolution for single-molecule ion channel dynamics studies. Our proposed technical approach, patch-clamp confocal single-molecule fluorescence imaging microscopy, will be applicable for a broad range of ion channel proteins and receptors in various cells, including all of the cellular systems that have been traditionally studied by conventional patch-clamp electric current measurements and proteins that can be probed by fluorescence. We will use the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in living cells as a model system to demonstrate our innovative physical technique and its unprecedented applications in life sciences and medical researchers. The dynamics of NMDA receptor mediated calcium currents is crucial to the normal function of the brain. The temporal behavior of NMDA receptor activity is regulated by the dynamic conformational changes of the protein in response to agonist binding and dissociation. Identifying the conformational motions of the receptor is critical for understanding the mechanisms of receptor function. Inhomogeneous conformational motions of the receptor control the activation, inactivation, desensitization and deactivation of the channel that in turn shape the calcium transients."
"9434404","Project Summary/Abstract Osteoporosis is highly prevalent among older adults in the United States, with approximately 10 million people affected. Nearly 50% of women over age 50 years and 25% of white men over age 60 years will suffer an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetimes, with significant consequences including death, difficulty in performing activities of daily living, loss of ambulatory ability, nursing home placement, and chronic pain. Bisphosphonates, a class of medications that are strong inhibitors of osteoclast bone remodeling, are effective for reducing fracture risk and the most commonly prescribed medications for osteoporosis treatment. FDA- approved bisphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis include alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid. These medications should not be continued indefinitely due to an increased risk of rare serious adverse events, such as atypical femoral fracture or osteonecrosis of the jaw, with therapy duration beyond 5 years. However, there is uncertainty with respect to the optimal duration of bisphosphonate therapy for individuals with osteoporosis. Furthermore, for individuals who stop treatment, the optimal duration of the ?drug holiday?, or period of time in which treatment is stopped before restarting treatment, is unknown. Bisphosphonates bind to bone and can remain bound for many years, thus resulting in residual pharmacological activity for years after discontinuation. However, binding affinity to bone varies among the bisphosphonates, and thus it is likely that the optimal drug holiday duration may vary depending on the particular bisphosphonate. The purpose of this proposed research is to systematically review the evidence on the duration of treatment for which fracture risk reduction has been demonstrated for each of the FDA- approved bisphosphonates for osteoporosis treatment and associated fracture risk reduction efficacy and change in bone mineral density (BMD) on bisphosphonate treatment, the impact of drugs holidays on fracture risk and BMD, and the safety (adverse events rates) associated with different durations of treatment (Aim 1); and to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different treatment and drug holiday durations for each bisphosphonate for U.S. adults with osteoporosis (Aim 2). Our analyses would address key osteoporosis clinical care knowledge gaps and provide evidence to guide treatment duration and drug holiday duration decisions in clinical practice; and help enable a future R01 proposal to investigate approaches to translate findings about best treatment practices to the clinical setting to reduce osteoporosis-related morbidity and mortality. Our research team is ideally suited to perform this work; we have substantial experience and expertise in osteoporosis, systematic reviews/meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness modeling, and a track record of successful collaboration."
"9430743","PROJECT SUMMARY Targeted metabolomics offers a sensitive and accurate platform to compare the levels of pre-specified metabolites in biological samples. In particular, the use of selected ion monitoring (SIM) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) has become an ideal method for quantitative analysis of metabolite targets using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), respectively. Although targeted metabolomics allows more sensitive and accurate measurements than untargeted metabolomics, the ability to determine the identity of most of the potential targets from untargeted studies as well as the lack of tools for designing targeted experiments have been a challenge for researchers aiming to conduct large-scale targeted metabolomic studies. Our team recently developed a software tool (MetaboSearch) for metabolite identification and an R-package SIMAT for designing targeted metabolomics experiments by GC-SIM-MS and analyzing the resulting data. In this application, we propose to develop: (1) an R-package metID for a network-based prioritization of putative metabolite IDs identified by mass-based search tools such as MetaboSearch; and (2) an R-package SRMAT that selects optimal transitions for targeted metabolomic experiments by LC-SRM-MS. Together with MetaboSearch, metID will enable users to prioritize putative metabolite IDs for analytes that may be associated with disease based on findings from previous untargeted metabolomic studies. For highly-scored putative metabolite IDs, SIMAT and SRMAT will choose transitions and retention times/indices for targeted experiments by GC-SIM-MS and LC-SRM-MS, respectively, and perform quantitation of the levels of target metabolites. Successful implementation of the proposed suite of tools will enable researchers to capitalize on the power of targeted metabolomics for accurate evaluation of the levels of promising metabolites in biological samples to uncover the relationships of the metabolites with the phenotypes of the samples."
"9567726","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bromine (Br2) is a highly toxic dark-reddish liquid, which evaporates readily to a red vapor with a suffocating odor. World production of Br2 exceeds 300,000 tons per year. Exposure to Br2 causes acute lung injury, death from respiratory failure, and fibrosis. Because of the potential for industrial and transportation accidents to release of large amounts of Br2 in populated areas, Br2 presents a clear and present danger to public health. Few published studies have evaluated the acute and chronic sequelae of Br2 inhalation; treatment remains symptomatic and no effective countermeasures exist. Similar to human pathology, exposure of mice to Br2 causes reactive airway disease syndrome (RADS), increased permeability of the blood gas barrier to plasma proteins, and inflammation followed by sub-epithelial airway fibrosis and significant mortality. The overall purpose of this application is to identify the biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for these events and develop appropriate countermeasures. We propose that Br2 and hypobromous acid (HOBr-) interact with and fragment high molecular weight hyaluronan (H-HA), a ubiquitous matrix glycosaminoglycan, to generate highly inflammatory low molecular weight hyaluronan fragments (L-HA). L- HA binds to CD44 and Toll like receptor (TLR)-4, increases intracellular Ca+2 and activates TGF-?1, and RhoA in lung epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells. These events lead to RADS, increased epithelial permeability to plasma proteins, epithelial-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) of airway cells, sub-epithelial fibrosis, an death from respiratory failure. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time the formation of brominated lipids in the lungs and plasma of mice exposed to Br2. These compounds, formed by the interaction of Br2 with lung plasmalogens, mediate and amplify Br2 lung injury and act as biomarkers of Br2 exposure. Based on solid data we posit that post-Br2 exposure administration of aerosolized Yabro? (a form of H-HA, currently in clinical trials in Europe for asthma), attenuates lung damage, enhances repair and decreases mortality. Experiments proposed in the first specific aim will assess physiological, biochemical, and morphological changes in mice exposed to Br2 and returned to room air for up to three weeks and test the effectiveness of aerosolized Yabro? administered post exposure to decrease lung injury and mortality. We will then identify the mechanisms by which Br2 damages rodent and human airway smooth muscle (ASM), bronchial and alveolar type II (ATII) cells. We posit that Br2, brominated lipids, and L-HA increase intracellular Ca2+ and activate RhoA, which lead to increased airway contractility and epithelial permeability.

"9351170","Prospective, active safety surveillance of medical devices offers significant advantages over traditional passive event reporting strategies in identifying previously unexpected safety risks arising from device failure risks or damage/sabotage from chemical, biologic, radiologic or nuclear (CBRN) events. However, methodological, data availability, and access of data owners to validated tools with which to monitor safety all challenge the development of a coordinated national approach to active medical device surveillance. This proposal seeks to extend our prior work in the development and validation of an active medical device safety surveillance system, by developing methodologies to address learning effects and to implement simplify risk adjustment model development. These efforts will permit generalized application of the active surveillance tools to a very broad range of medical product safety monitoring efforts for traditional post-market needs or for Medical Countermeasure efforts. The proposal centers on the multi-stakeholder collaboration among MDEpiNet methodology center in cooperation with three large and representative cardiovascular device registry owners: The American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Device Registry (NCDR), the Massachusetts Data Analysis Center (Mass-DAC), and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  We propose to study the safety of 15 new cardiovascular devices, recently introduced, or anticipated to become available for clinical use over the next 5 years. These monitoring studies will employ prospective risk- adjusted cohort and sequential analytic methods, adjusted for impacts of device learning. In addition, the studies will evaluate the performance of advanced automated variable selection methods, as compared with domain-expert informed model development. Each of the three cardiovascular registries collaborating on this proposal have unique attributes regarding geographic representation, data quality, integration with electronic health record systems, and ability to link to longitudinal administrative and clinical health records. These differences in clinical data scope, scale and depth, will permit unique active device safety surveillance, through the establishment of pre-specified signal-verification analyses that will be triggered when a safety alert is identified in one dataset, through rapid assessment of the signal in the other registries.  Finally, the complete safety surveillance system will be released as open-source software through an existing National Center for Biomedical Computing to foster collaboration in this field. The software will be available for free, to be used for any public health or academic application toward active medical product safety surveillance. The availability of these validated tools will permit data owners to monitor their clinical medical device datasets independently, or through programs coordinated through the FDA, the MDEpiNet program or other public and private stakeholders, to support the emerging national medical device safety surveillance network."
"9339568","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and function) universally affects the elderly and has a tremendous impact on quality of life, independent living, disability and healthcare costs in aging veterans. Oxidative stress has been implicated to play a role in the underlying mechanisms of a number of age-related degenerative diseases including sarcopenia. In previous studies from my laboratory, we have shown that mice lacking the antioxidant enzyme CuZnSOD (Sod1-/- mice) have high levels of oxidative stress and exhibit loss of muscle mass and function similar to the degenerative changes seen in old wild type mice. Thus, the Sod1-/- mice are a powerful model to gain unique insight into the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia. One of the most striking phenotypes in aging and in the Sod1-/- mice is the disruption and fragmentation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The NMJ is the site of interaction between the motor neurons and skeletal muscle and is critical for muscle viability and performance. At present, the relative contributions of the motor neuron and muscle in deterioration of the NMJ and age-related muscle atrophy are poorly understood. This knowledge is essential to our ability to design effective interventions to delay or prevent sarcopenia. Therefore, to address this important question, we generated a conditional Sod1-/- mouse model in which we can delete Sod1 in muscle and nerve respectively to assess the relative contributions of the two tissues to NMJ deterioration and muscle atrophy. We demonstrated that deletion of Sod1 restricted to skeletal muscle tissue does not result in muscle atrophy or alterations in the NMJ, suggesting that muscle atrophy is initiated by changes in the motor neuron. In the current study, we will test the hypothesis that alterations in the neuromuscular junction play a critical role in sarcopenia through the initiation of downstream degenerative processes in skeletal muscle. To do this, we will negatively and positively modulate the NMJ through presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations and determine the effect on downstream pathways in muscle that contribute to atrophy and muscle weakness. First, we will determine if increased presynaptic oxidative stress generated by neuron specific deletion of Sod1 in mice (nSod1-/- mice) leads to NMJ degeneration and initiation of muscle atrophy pathways. We will measure NMJ morphology, composition and function and acetylcholine receptor (AchR) fragmentation in age-matched wild type, nSod1-/- mice and Sod1-/- mice and in old wild type mice. In addition, we will take an unbiased approach at changes in gene expression in response to NMJ disruption using microarrays and a more biased approach to measure changes in muscle degenerative pathways indicated to be altered in response to loss of innervation in our previous studies in Sod1-/- mice (calpain protease and proteasome activities, mitochondrial function and ROS generation and oxidative modification of muscle proteins). Conversely, we will determine if reversal of presynaptic oxidative stress through neuron specific expression of a human Sod1 transgene in Sod1-/- mice (nTgSod1-/- mice) rescues NMJ degeneration and prevents initiation of gene expression changes and muscle atrophy pathways. Together these studies will allow us to determine the effects of presynaptic changes on the NMJ and muscle atrophy pathways. Finally, we will measure the effect of postsynaptic NMJ disruption initiated by agrin deletion. Because agrin is essential for NMJ clustering and stability, loss of agrin leads to postsynaptic NMJ disruption and muscle atrophy. While the models used in Aims 1 and 2 target the role of the presynaptic neuron directly, this model allows us to target the NMJ at the postsynaptic side to determine if the gene expression changes and muscle degenerative pathways are the same or different in this postsynaptic model of NMJ disruption. Together these studies will define the role of the NMJ in muscle atrophy and point to common pathways affected by NMJ disruption that might be important targets for interventions."
"9337586","MAYO CLINIC JACKSONVILLE - Subcontract PROJECT SUMMARY The amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-? (A?) and neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Recent studies have shown that these pathological lesions progressively spread from one brain region to another likely through a trans-synaptic mechanism. The major goal of Project 3 is to dissect the molecular and cellular pathways that either promote or inhibit A?/tau spreading with a specific focus on neuronal receptors LRP1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). As the ?4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, we will also evaluate the apoE isoform-specific effects on A?/tau spreading and whether such effects depend on the presence of neuronal LRP1/HSPG. During the previous funding cycle, Project 3 has defined the roles of apoE isoforms and apoE receptor LRP1 and HSPG in brain A? metabolism, establishing the opposing roles of LRP1 (beneficial) and HSPG (harmful) in brain A? metabolism, as well as the modulatory effects of apoE isoforms. HSPG has been suggested to promote pathological spreading of tau. Importantly, our preliminary studies in collaboration with Project 1 (Holtzman, PI) have also demonstrated a role of LRP1 in cellular uptake of tau monomer and aggregates. Further, we have detected an apoE isoform-dependent effects on tau-mediated behavioral deficits in mice, thus linking A?, tau, apoE, LRP1 and HSPG in related pathogenic pathways. Thus, we hypothesize that LRP1 inhibits and HSPG promotes the speed and extent of pathological spreading of A? and tau aggregates, and that apoE further modulates these events in an isoform-specific manner. We propose three specific aims to address our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will examine how neuronal LRP1 and HSPG modulate pathological spreading of A? and tau aggregates in vivo using conditional mouse models. We will also address how the presence of amyloid pathology impacts tau pathology and spreading in an LRP1- or HSPG-dependent manner, In Aim 2, we will analyze how apoE isoforms modulate pathological spreading of tau aggregates and whether any apoE effects depend on the presence of LRP1, HSPG, or amyloid pathology. Conditional mouse models as well as viral mediated expression of apoE isoforms will be employed in these studies. In Aim 3, we will dissect the mechanisms by which LRP1, HSPG and apoE isoforms regulate cellular trafficking, degradation or accumulation of various aggregated forms of A? and tau. Mouse primary neurons, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human neurons, as well as microfluidic platform will be used for these studies. Interactions with other PPG projects will include evaluating the effects of neuronal activities and sleep/wake cycle on LRP1/HSPG/apoE-dependent A?/tau spreading. This project will use Viral Vector Core for the production of AAV and lentiviral vectors for in vivo and in vitro studies. Together, these studies should generate critical insights into the molecular mechanism underlying A?/tau spreading and inform strategies for mechanism-based therapy to combat AD and other neurodegenerative diseases with tauopathies."
"9405964","ABSTRACT  Project 1 Project I: Definition, Classification, and Prediction of Risk Word-level reading disability (i.e., dyslexia) and specific reading comprehension disability (SRCD) are two important public health problems, with estimates of prevalence ranging from 3 to 20 percent for reading disability and 8 to 10 percent for SRCD. The long-term objective of this project is to substantially increase replicable knowledge about the nature of these learning disabilities and to implement this knowledge in tools that potentially can improve the outcomes of individuals with learning disabilities and their families. Existing definitions of reading disability that prioritize a single indicator (e.g., poor decoding, inadequate response to instruction/intervention) show poor levels of agreement and longitudinal stability. However, an operational definition derived from a multivariate model of reading disability shows substantially better performance by combining multiple indicators. Specific aim 1 is to implement a multivariate model of reading disability as a tool that can be used at the level of the individual to predict risk, aid in identification, and estimate probabilities about functionally-significant outcomes such as the likely value of using assistive technology. Model-based meta-analysis, simulation, and application to new data will be used to generate and test prediction models, including models derived from artificial intelligence and Bayesian inference. Specific aim 2 is to identify neurobiological and behavioral leading indicators of dyslexia that may have value for predicting risk, aiding identification, or in predicting functionally significant outcomes. Although established relations exist between brain-based constructs (both structural and functional) and language and literacy constructs, it is largely unknown whether the brain-based constructs are best conceptualized as causes, consequences, or mere correlates of the language and literacy constructs. Latent change score modeling, a form of dynamic systems modeling, is a state-of-the-science approach to test alternative models that posit leading, lagging, or no direct relations between two constructs beyond their mere correlated development. Specific aim 3 is to further understanding about the nature of specific reading comprehension disability and how it best can be predicted and identified. We intend to further explore the nature of this phenomenon and to use the approach we will have outlined in specific aim 1 to develop a model for predicting risk of specific reading comprehension disability. Finally specific aim 4 is to recruit, study, analyze, and report disaggregated results where possible for historically understudied and underserved populations (e.g., English Language Learners, families living in poverty, males and females, racial/ethnic identity) as we work to achieve the previous three specific aims."
"9449189","Project Summary  ?-Secretase is a membrane-embedded protease complex with presenilin as its catalytic component. This complex cleaves the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of a wide variety of type I integral membrane proteins after their ectodomain release by sheddases. Among these substrates are Notch and the amyloid ?-protein precursor (APP). TMD cleavage of Notch receptors is part of cell signaling mechanisms essential to metazoan biology and dysregulated in cancer, and TMD cleavage of APP to amyloid ?-protein (A?) is essential to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate how intramembrane proteolysis is accomplished by ?-secretase. Toward this end, we will address three central open questions regarding the mechanism of this complex enzyme that is so critical in biology and medicine. (1) How does ?-secretase recognize substrates? As the enzyme cleaves the TMD of substrate, we seek to understand the role of helicity in substrate recognition. In addition, we have used a recent high-resolution structure of the protease complex to design experiments to identify the gate on presenilin that allows access of substrate TMD into the active site. (2) How does ?-secretase carry out processive proteolysis? ?-Secretase initially cleaves substrates within their TMDs close to the cytosolic interface, followed by processive carboxypeptidase trimming resulting in secreted peptides. We will address whether the longer A? peptide intermediates have higher affinity for the enzyme, allowing more time for trimming, than shorter A? peptides. We will also address whether peptide product intermediates remain bound or dissociate from the enzyme prior to further trimming. (3) How does ?-secretase unwind helical TMD substrates for proteolysis? We have designed a series of hybrid helical peptide/transition-state analog inhibitors to mimic the TMD substrate bound to the enzyme in the transition state. In collaboration with a leading structural biology lab, structure elucidation of the most potent hybrid inhibitor bound to active ?-secretase will be determined to understand the structural basis of the ?-secretase mechanism of action."

This third competing renewal application builds on a strong and successful infrastructure for managing clinical trials and on a track record of innovation and successful implementation of addictions management in mainstream healthcare settings where the vast majority of SUD patients are seen. Our vision for the CTN of the future includes (1) a continued focus on integrating management of addiction in mainstream healthcare settings and management of medical conditions (e.g. HIV, HCV) in addictions settings, (2) a continued focus on leveraging health information technology which includes using EHRs to coordinate care and improve outcomes, (3) an evolving focus on studies to inform adaptive treatment strategies and on relatively low cost registry-based pragmatic comparative effectiveness studies, (4) a continued focus on stage 2 / phase 2 research where CTN resources can be efficiently used to develop new treatments, and (5) a platform on which focused- and population- level genetics-, clinical neuroscience-, epidemiology- and services- research and research training can be conducted. The GNYN has 15 years of CTN experience, and the expertise, resources and partners necessary to support this vision. The team has exceptional breadth and depth and an established track-record of collaboration both amongst researchers and with providers and institutions, particularly in the service of the proposed research agenda. The Node has complementary strengths in integration of addictions management in mainstream healthcare settings; health information technology, eHealth and mHealth; pharmacotherapy and vaccine development; behavioral therapy and combined medication-behavioral treatments; HIV, HCV and other infections; co-occurring psychiatric disorders; prevention, early intervention, pediatrics and adolescents; criminal justice populations; smoking and alcohol; genetics, clinical neuroscience and neuroimaging; clinical trials methodology; and dissemination, implementation and sustainability. Healthcare organizations include large public and private hospital-based systems (Bellevue Hospital Center, NY City Health and Hospitals Corp, Mount Sinai Health System, Einstein Montefiore Health System, VA NY Harbor Healthcare System and SUNY Upstate University Health System), all of which have addictions treatment services. Traditional specialty addictions programs include START, LESC, Odyssey House, Phoenix House and Narco Freedom, which provide a great range of addictions, medical and behavioral health services and which are keen to coordinate care with mainstream settings. We continue to engage policy-makers and dissemination experts, including the NY State OASAS, the NY City DOHMH, the NY City HHC, as well as the NeC-ATTC, and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA), so that their input can inform the research agenda and foster adoption of innovation."
"9479911","Project 3 Abstract Despite recent progress in establishing clinical criteria for ME/CFS, diagnosis is delayed in many patients, largely due to an absence of objective clinical and laboratory tests for disease. An additional challenge for patients and clinicians alike is that the onset and course of ME/CFS are variable, as are comorbidities. The implications of variability are myriad and include potential for differences in pathways to illness, prognosis, and management. This project will lay the foundation for resolving diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty, distinguishing sub-types, enabling insights into pathogenesis, and facilitating management of illness through pursuit of three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will establish a hub for state-of-the-art translational research based on the CfS for ME/CFS clinical network. The network will be fully committed to the NINDS Common Data Elements project and to collection of survey data and biological samples needed for rigorous clinical research. We will also design a mobile app, myME/CFS, to help patients and physicians acquire valuable longitudinal data and personally and clinically manage the illness. In Aim 2, we will mine existing databases to identify clinical sub-types that differ in presentation, course, comorbidities, family medical history, or other features. In Aim 3, we will assess the clinical utility of a simple office-based test for autonomic dysfunction, the Lean Test. We will also assess the impact of the Lean Test and an Exercise Tolerance Test on plasma metabolomics and PBMC transcriptomics, thereby integrating this clinical research project with the two basic science projects in the CfS for ME/CFS."

"9561357","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cutaneous wound repair is an essential regenerative process that restores the skin barrier function in response to injury. Impaired wound healing is an important clinical problem that significantly impacts the quality of life of patients and health care cost. Therefore, understanding the molecular control of the wound healing process is crucial to the development of therapeutic agents. Work from our previous funding cycle identified LCN2`s crucial role in cell migration and wound healing. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize LCN2 acts through MMP-9 to promote keratinocyte migration and wound healing in a time dependent manner and that manipulating their levels improves wound healing in normal and diabetic mice. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims. Aim 1: To determine the mechanism(s) by which LCN2 promotes cell migration and wound healing We will test how inhibition and genetic loss-of-function of MMP9 affects LCN2 regulation of migration and wound repair in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, we will evaluate how exogenous MMP-9 can rescue impaired wound healing in Lcn2-deficient mice. Furthermore, to identify downstream effectors of LCN2, we will employ unbiased comparative proteomics of recombinant LCN2- and control-treated keratinocytes as well as Lcn2 knockout and wild-type-derived keratinocytes. Aim 2: To determine the temporal requirement of LCN2 and MMP-9 in wound healing We hypothesize that LCN2 and MMP-9 are required in the initial phase of wound healing but later need to be downregulated for proper healing to occur. We will manipulate LCN2 and MMP-9 levels at all consecutive key phases during wound repair and establish the timing for an optimal wound healing response as a prerequisite for potential future therapeutic approaches. Aim 3: To determine the effect of LCN2 on wound healing in diabetic mice We will evaluate the effect of topical LCN2 treatment on wound healing in two established diabetic mouse models, and directly compare its response to becaplermin, currently the only FDA-approved topical agent. In addition, we will also evaluate how manipulating LCN2 and MMP-9 in a temporal manner affects diabetic wound healing."
"9386341","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the commonest genetic disorder in the World. It is most prevalent in Africa. We have established SickleGenAfrica:Sickle Cell Disease Genomics Network of Africa to build capacity locally to enable African scientists study genomics of SCD on the continent. The network consists of a core of investigators in nine institutions in four sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries (Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania). Our prior studies showed that 1.8% of births in Ghana are affected by SCD. Penicillin prophylaxis in neonates has reduced mortality in SCD, however, this progress has not been matched by advancements in reducing deaths due to other causes. End-stage organ damage is now the leading cause of death among SCD patients in the West and it is poised to become the major cause of death in Africa once prevention and prompt management of infections becomes widely implemented on the continent. Inflammatory molecules such as free heme released from hemolysis cause severe tissue injury that ultimately causes organ damage in SCD. Malaria causes severe intravascular hemolysis and potentially exacerbates hemolysis-related tissue damage in SCD uniquely in Africa. There is a hierarchy of cytoprotective proteins that neutralize the inflammatory molecules released by hemolysis. Studies in transgenic SCD mice indicate some of these cytoprotective proteins such as hemopexin and heme oxygenase-1, influence cardiopulmonary and vascular dysfunctions in SCD. Although these findings have not been validated in patients, we have discovered wide variations in the level of several key hemolysis cytoprotective proteins among patients, suggesting that these proteins modify the clinical phenotype of SCD perhaps most strongly in Africa. Hitherto, the genetics of this variation has not been defined. In addition, the functional murine studies are limited to a few organ systems, and to scientists in the West, since transgenic sickle mice colonies are not available in institutions in Africa. We seek to address these gaps by accomplishing seven objectives: (1) Phenotype 7, 000 SCD patients and controls in four SSA countries; (2) perform three collaborative genetic research project each with a functional validation study in transgenic sickle mice; (3) Establish a molecular hematology and sickle cell mouse core in Ghana; (4) Leverage an existing H3Africa biorepository to establish a SCD biorepository core in Nigeria; (5) Establish a bioinformatics core at the University of Pittsburgh to analyze the genomics data obtained by the H3Africa Center and to provide expertise to upgrade bioinformatics nodes in Ghana in partnership with H3ABionet; (6) Implement a career pipeline model to train future science leaders in Africa in blood disorders research; (7) establish a cross cutting Administrative core enabling synergy and coordination of network activities with a robust sustainability plan for the H3Africa Center.

"9362535","PROJECT SUMMARY Our goal is to generate knowledge that will inform programs to improve pregnancy outcomes among women with physical, sensory, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. In the first phase, we will conduct a province-wide study using Ontario (Canada) health care and social services data. Our specific aims are to: (1) Describe the fertility rates and pre-pregnancy characteristics of women with and without disabilities; (2) Compare maternal and infant outcomes of women with vs. without disabilities; and (3) Evaluate factors that exacerbate or explain risks for poor outcomes. In the second phase, we will interview women with disabilities, service-providers, and decision-makers in Ontario. Our specific aims are to: (1) Further explore factors that could exacerbate or explain risks; and (2) Identify how knowledge of risks can be used to improve pregnancy-related care for women with disabilities.  In the first phase, we will obtain data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, an independent, non-profit organization that houses databases containing health data gathered from the health care encounters of all Ontario residents. This information can be linked with disability income support documentation from the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services. Women will be classified as having physical, sensory, intellectual and developmental, or multiple disabilities if they have relevant diagnoses recorded in health care data or in documentation for disability income support receipt. We will identify all obstetrical deliveries to 18- to 49-year-old women with and without disabilities between 2009 and 2014. Study outcomes will be indicators of maternal and infant health monitored by the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System. In the second phase, we will interview women with disabilities, service-providers, and decision-makers who will be recruited from our existing partnerships with self-advocacy, clinical, and government organizations. We will analyze interview transcripts to identify themes that describe clinical applications to improve pregnancy outcomes of women with disabilities.  The goal of this funding opportunity is to stimulate research that will result in evidence-based interventions to improve pregnancy experiences of women with disabilities. Our aims directly address this goal. Detailed estimates of pregnancy risks, grounded in the experiences of women with disabilities, service-providers, and decision-makers, will create information needed to improve screening, follow-up, and support for pregnant women with disabilities. We use methods not currently available in the US, thus significantly adding to scientific and clinical knowledge in this area."
"9406669","Project 5 (Epigenetics) is a new, but integral part of the Texas Center for Learning Disabilities, which now moves into the field of genetics. As such is highly responsive to the RFA-HD-17-006 in that it focuses on adolescents with severe reading problems in Grades 7-8 who are English learners (Els), i.e., an understudied and underserved subpopulation of US adolescents. It has been designated a high-risk?high-reward project because it offers a novel line of research attempting to investigate the correlations between the dynamics of response to intervention (RTI) and DNA methylation across 21 months, sampling behavior, the brain, and the methylome at three time points (prior to the beginning, in the middle, and upon completion of a high-quality intensive reading intervention). Project 5 offers a set of objectives and hypotheses formulated around this opportunity (SA1). In addition to content contributions that will be generated while achieving SA1, Project 5 offers two methodological aims (SA2 and SA3) to address issues concerning the specificity and generality of the characteristics of the methylome when ascertained from different populations of cells. These issues are central to and remain unresolved in the bourgeoning field of behavioral epigenetics. To achieve its Specific Aims, Project 5 will recruit a sample of 672 adolescents stratified into three groups: typically developing students (recruited from Project 2, Attention) and Els with persistent reading difficulties (recruited from Project 3, Intervention), who are further subdivided into treated and untreated (business as usual) students. Capitalizing on the conceptualizations of learning disabilities and of RTI developed in Project 1 (Integration), Project 5 aims to investigate both categorical (group) and continuous (dimensional) indicators of reading performance and related processes cross-sectionally, as well as longitudinally at multiple levels of analyses? the epigenome, the brain, and behavior, seeking to understand individual differences in instructional response. It is hypothesized, in general, that both categorical and dimensional approaches to reading difficulties will be marked by specific characteristics of the DNA methylation profile, captured by indicators of hyper- and hypomethylation. We hypothesize that through the analyses of these characteristics, it will be possible to identify genes and gene networks that substantiate learning in general and learning to read in particular."

Specifically, the Data Core will map, manage, and analyze the single cell-level data generated across the project, including transcriptomes, dendritic/axonal morphology, and cell body location data. The common reference framework will be designed to permit web-based access and visualization of the primary data and facilitate efficient data transfer to the U24-funded data center (BCDC). Data Core lead Dr. Partha Mitra (CSHL) and co-lead, Dr. Aviv Regev (Broad Institute), will leverage existing frameworks designed to manage, analyze, and distribute high- resolution anatomical data (the Mouse Brain Architecture program at CSHL) and single cell transcriptome data (the Single Cell Portal at Broad). Specific activities of the Data Core will include developing statistically controlled high performance algorithms for biological knowledge discovery, data preprocessing and quality control, atlas mapping of individual brains onto a reference brain, and development and maintenance of a single unified data access portal."
"9374697","RESEARCH METHODS CORE ABSTRACT Our Center proposes a novel deployment focused model that both streamlines behavioral interventions for late- and mid-life mood disorders and improves their delivery in the community. In response to the Center's and the field's needs, the Research Methods Core (RMC) will perform the following functions: 1. The RMC will provide operational support to the Center's new and ongoing, independently funded intervention studies to ensure the highest quality in design, procedures, and analytic strategies. 2. The RMC will develop novel methods outlined in three initiatives: Initiative 1. Analytic methods to increase the efficiency and the information yield of T2 community- based effectiveness studies. This initiative supports the Center's program of behavioral interventions with multiple outcomes and distinct behavioral targets by developing analytic approaches: 1) To maximize information on intervention outcomes reflecting meaningful dimensions of health and to reduce sample size requirements; 2) To estimate the indirect effect of longitudinal, continuous behavioral mediators of outcomes; 3) To increase the information yield of multiple repeated assessments by mobile health technology and the ability to make comparisons. Initiative 2. Approaches to integrating multiple big data sources to identify populations in need of novel interventions and deployment approaches and to policy support. This initiative responds to the Center's and the field's need to identify subgroups with mood disorders underserved by the current health care system. Accordingly, it will develop: 1) Innovative approaches for integration of heterogeneously distributed biomedical big data; 2) Methods for identifying individuals with multiple mental and physical conditions; and 3) Approaches to characterizing subgroups with poor outcomes. Combined with stakeholders' input, this information can chart directions for future community interventions. Initiative 3: Novel approaches to integrating mobile technology in community interventions taking into account the skill sets of patients and therapists, and the resources of community settings. Mobile technology is embedded in the Center's behavioral interventions to augment information available to community clinicians and to guide them in targeting their sessions. This initiative responds to the Center's and the field's need for mobile technology accessible to older and middle-aged mental health consumers and usable at busy community treatment settings. 3. Evaluate the Center's research productivity and impact on the field. 4. Disseminate methodological advances and other Center generated resources."
"9518390","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the UniProt Consortium is to provide a centralized curated, accurate, stable, and comprehensive protein sequence and function resource by enhancing the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and ensuring that the diverse information in UniProt will be of use to a broad scientific user community by exploiting a range of dissemination strategies. This objective will enable new scientific discoveries in the fields of biomedical research that will enhance human health. The specific aims of the project are: 1. To provide the experimental information associated with proteins through manual curation of the scientific literature. This will be achieved by identifying and curating newly experimentally characterized proteins and by updating existing proteins for new information. Interaction with other manually curated resources will be extended, and community standard interfaces used. 2. To automatically annotate experimentally uncharacterized proteins, increasing both coverage and depth. This will enhance the value of the exponentially growing protein sequence space and allow for the correction of erroneous information. UniProt's rule based system will be made available to the community. 3. To act as the global central hub for protein information. This will be achieved by leveraging data from other resources either as imports or as links/visualization and organizing the data for its optimum use and navigation. New data types will be included as they become available, and the technical infrastructure will be developed to scale with the continued growth in protein sequences. 4. To maintain and further develop UniProt's website and other services. This will be done by creating or incorporating specialized visualizations from other resources for a more intuitive and better overview, and by providing appropriate web services and formats to facilitate the extraction of UniProt's rich data. 5. To actively seek user feedback from and provide training for existing and new user communities. Designated user experience testing and the engagement of new user communities will help to define future directions. Target research communities include researchers working on genetic variation, medical researchers and clinicians, cell biologists and drug discovery/ pharmaceutical researchers.         RELEVANCE: The databases produced by the UniProt Consortium provide researchers with an integrated access to protein sequence and function by gathering and enriching data from genomics and proteomics projects as well as the results published by individual researchers. This is a crucial step in making genomics and proteomics research results easily accessible to support biomedical research in academia and industry and hence facilitate the development of preventive and curative strategies for human health."

"9419081","BIOREPOSITORY AND CLINICAL TRIALS OFFICE SHARED RESOURCE SUMMARY The establishment and implementation of the South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) Biorepository/Clinical Trials Office (CTO) Shared Resource is expected to significantly expand the research capacity of the SC CADRE investigators at South Carolina State University (SCSU), thus enhancing their ability to compete for independent, R01-level funding. This new, dual-component Shared Resource will also augment SCSU's ability to attract additional junior faculty researchers who will have access to biospecimens from racially and ethnically diverse patient populations as well as to clinical trials infrastructure at the Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg Mabry Cancer Center (RMC-MCC). The overarching goal of the Biorepository/CTO Shared Resource is to support the development of cancer research at SCSU through both a Biorepository component and a CTO component. The Biorepository component will give SC CADRE investigators access to the RMC-MCC's patient blood and tissue specimens that were previously unavailable for research due to the lack of a biorepository infrastructure. Likewise, the CTO component will facilitate the implementation of clinical trials, providing an infrastructure for SCSU investigators to conduct research in their Orangeburg, SC community as well as providing the Orangeburg community immediate access to other NCI- approved clinical trials which have not been available to date. This Shared Resource will support the implementation of two initial SC CADRE clinical trials in Years 1-3 which will provide the biological and outcomes data needed to evaluate the hypothesized relationships that are being assessed in each of the three initial SC CADRE Full and Pilot Research Projects. Additionally, this Biorepository/CTO Shared Resource will support future SC CADRE Full and Pilot Research Projects as well as other NCI-approved clinical research studies at the RMC-MCC, with the goal of enhancing participation of diverse populations in cancer clinical research."
"9428948","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the highly prevalent co- occurring symptoms (sleep disturbance, fatigue, and impaired cognition) in persons with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). My goal in seeking this K23 is to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills, and research experience to become an independent investigator focused on identifying mechanisms triggering the development of these symptoms following SAH as well as identifying symptom management strategies. My long-term goal is to design precision interventions targeting symptoms post-SAH based upon mechanisms elucidated in the proposed study. My short-term goals through this K23 training award are to acquire didactic and mentored training in 1) physiology and pathophysiology of the inflammatory response post-SAH and its? laboratory measurement, 2) sleep science including objective measurement of sleep disturbance using actigraphy, 3) translational and longitudinal research methods and clinical trial design, and 4) advanced statistical methods. My research training will be supported by an interdisciplinary team of scientists: Drs. Hilaire Thompson (immune response, brain injury and longitudinal methods), Mark Opp (neuroimmunology and sleep), Susan McCurry (sleep and cognition), Kyra Becker (immune response, stroke, fatigue and genetics), and Kevin Cain (biostatistician). It is known that SAH triggers inflammation in the brain. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) are up-regulated after SAH and initiate the inflammatory response. This activation induces production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play a role in symptom development. Polymorphisms inTLR4 and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes may also have a role in biologic pathways for symptom development post-SAH as they are associated with sleep disturbances and fatigue in other populations. I hypothesize that TLR4 up-regulation following SAH triggers an inflammatory response in the brain and the extent of the inflammatory response and polymorphisms in TLR4, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFA), Interleukin (IL)1B, and IL6 influence later symptom development, notably sleep disturbance, fatigue and impaired cognition. To test this hypothesis, a 6-month longitudinal study using a convenience sample of 100 SAH survivors will be conducted to 1) describe changes in sleep disturbance (actigraphy: total sleep time, efficiency, self-report: quality, daytime sleepiness), fatigue, and impaired cognition (attention, language, memory and global function) at 2, 3, and 6 months, 2) examine both early (to day 7 post- SAH) and concurrent (2, 3, 6 mo) TLR4 mRNA expression, and TNF-?, IL1?, IL6 plasma levels in relation to these symptoms over time, and 3) explore the associations of TLR4, TNFA, IL1B and IL6 polymorphisms with symptoms post-SAH over time. If development of sleep disturbance, fatigue and cognitive impairment after SAH share underlying inflammatory mechanisms, assessing and treating the inflammatory response may have a greater impact on improving health than targeting a single symptom."
"9467181","Abstract The dramatic increase in the number of patients being diagnosed with incidental pancreatic cysts  through improved imaging represents a unique opportunity to detect and treat cystic precursor  lesions before the onset of malignancy. However, pancreatic cysts also represent a major clinical  challenge because current diagnostics do not adequately reflect the biology of cyst malignant  transformation. Misregulated pericellular proteolysis is a hallmark of invasive cancer. Therefore,  we are exploiting the activities of proteases in cyst fluid to develop an enzyme-based diagnostic  test for the sensitive and specific identification of pre-malignant pancreatic lesions. Our goals  are to develop a rapid and minimally invasive assay that improves patient stratification over  current standard diagnostic markers and guides clinical decision-making to avoid unnecessary  surgical intervention. The Alaunus Biosciences diagnostic pipeline takes advantage of a substrate  profiling technology developed in the Craik Laboratory at UCSF referred to as Multiplex Substrate  Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS). The MSP-MS assay uses a peptide library platform to  monitor global protease substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency in complex biological samples  in an unbiased manner. Through applying this substrate profiling approach to small volumes of cyst  fluid (< 1 ?L) obtained by endoscopic ultrasound, we have identified proteases that have highly  increased activity in pre-malignant cysts and developed a proof-of-principle fluorogenic substrate  assay that achieves improved sensitivity and specificity compared to the current clinical standard  (CEA). In Aim 1, we propose to use our activity-based profiling approach to identify additional  distinguishing protease markers in an expanded patient cohort (and already evident in our existing  cyst fluid data). In Aim 2, substrate specificity profiles then will be used to rationally design  and optimize specific fluorogenic peptide substrates that are cleaved by the target proteases  discovered. Lead candidate substrates will be benchmarked in a blinded validation cohort for their  performance compared to CEA in distinguishing pre-malignant from benign cysts. If successful, this  proposal will lay the groundwork for an actionable diagnostic test that will enable early  identification of pre-malignant cysts and transform the clinical management of these challenging  lesions."
"9337583","Project Summary/Abstract The central role of amyloid beta peptide (A?) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been established by more than a decade of genetic, biochemical, animal, and human studies, but the biological functions of A? and the role of A? production and clearance in A? aggregation and in tau aggregation remain very unclear. The studies proposed in this PPG bring together three Project leaders with distinct and complementary experimental approaches to these questions. These studies will address the role of the sleep-wake cycle and brain network activity in modulating A? and tau aggregation and will also assess the effect of A? on tau spreading. These studies will further assess how the apoE/LRP1/HSPG pathways influence these effects. These studies will use a variety of tools to manipulate gene expression, including transgenic mice and lentiviral (LV) and adeno- associated virus (AAV) vectors. Viiral vectors, in combination with use of animal models that have selective expression of Cre recombinase and with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) and possibly with optogenetics, will allow both temporal and spatial control of manipulation of gene expression. Viral vectors are required for experiments in the intact CNS, where DNA transfection techniques are ineffective and generation of transgenic animals requires great time and expense. The Viral Vectors Core will design and produce these vectors, a more efficient approach than generating these vectors in individual labs. The Core has provided both LV and AAV vectors to the Washington University neuroscience community and to many groups outside our University for the past 11 years, with vectors provided for more than 100 different labs. The Core has experience with RNA silencing using shRNAs in both LV and AAV vector formats. The Core has developed new vectors to allow genetic manipulation of specific cell types and has packaged vectors for both DREADDS and optogenetics applications. The Core will work with Project 1-3 PIs to produce AAV vectors and LV vectors. The Core will use cultured neurons to test vectors to ensure the highest chance of success in more difficult and time-consuming in vivo experiments. The Core will work with PIs to devise new approaches and vectors as needed as experimental demands evolve."
"9382027","Project Summary  This project focuses on chloroplasts as central player in the generation of immune signals and the regulation of programmed cell death (PCD) required for innate immune responses against pathogen infection. Although mitochondria play a central role during mammalian PCD, emerging evidence suggests that in plants chloroplasts have a critical function in executing localized PCD that limits pathogen spread. Chloroplasts in addition to being involved in the generation of immune signals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and defense hormone salicylic acid (SA), also participate directly in the recognition of pathogen. Interestingly, the chloroplasts dynamically change their morphology during immune responses and send out tubular projections called stromules. These induced stromules use the cytoskeleton to extend and then anchor to the nucleus, which facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts and transport chloroplast-generated ROS and defense proteins to the nucleus. The overall goal of this application is to use combination of novel cell biology, genetics, proteomics and computational approaches to unravel the mechanistic basis of stromule driven periunclear chloroplast clustering and determine the identity and function of immune signals released from chloroplasts to nuclei. Specifically, Aim 1 will examine organelle and cytoskeleton dynamics during plant innate immunity. Novel computational methods quantifying stromule features and dynamics will be further developed and applied to understand chloroplasts, their stromules, and cytoskeleton dynamics during innate immunity. Both plant and animal pathogens target the cytoskeleton, and this aim will examine how pathogen effectors alter the cytoskeleton and related organelle dynamics as a virulence strategy. Aim 2 will investigate immune signals required for stromule induction and the release of chloroplast signals. The relationship of different ROS sources, organelle movement and PCD during immune responses will be examined using a combination of genetic tools and the computational methods developed in Aim 1. In Aim 3, known chloroplast-derived immune signals will be characterized and novel protein signals will be identified. The downstream targets of H2O2 in the nucleus will be elucidated and studied. Mass spectrometry will be used to identify proteins that are transported from chloroplasts to nuclei. Genetic approaches will be employed to examine their role during PCD. Lastly, the mechanism of release from chloroplasts during innate immunity will be studied to determine if it is akin to mitochondrial release during apoptosis in mammals. Understanding the role of different organelles during PCD and innate immunity will provide a unified mechanistic basis of cell death and cell survival process that occur in response to infectious pathogens. The results from our model systems will impact broadly on understanding of organelle-to-nuclear communication that influence innate immunity against infectious diseases."
"9561332","Identification of mutations in receptor and non-receptor protein kinases that drive malignant transformation of  cancer cells ('driver' mutations) have revolutionized patient care by opening the door to patient-tailored  targeted therapies that can improve patient survival. In order to discover new targets for therapy, we  sequenced the coding regions of -100 melanomas and identified a large number of somatic mutations and  inherited Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs). One of the most important findings of this effort is the  identification ofthe RAC1 signaling pathway as a potential new target for melanoma therapy. The analysis  revealed a recurrent, UV signature activating mutation in this RHO family of small GTPases, RAC[P29S], in  ~5% of melanomas, in addition, the sequencing data revealed mutations in upstream regulators and  downstream effectors of RAC1 pathway in a large numbers of melanoma tumors. Functional studies  demonstrated an important role in proliferation and migration of not only mutant but also melanoma cells that  that donot harbor the P29S mutation. The data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of RACl or its critical  effeGtor(s) can be applied for development of new therapies for melanoma patients. The general goals ofthis  project are to determine the frequency and prognostic significance of RAC[P29S] mutation in sun exposed  melanocytic lesions, and to identify downstream effectors of RACl most likely to be druggable targets in this  pathway. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the frequency of RAC1[P29S] mutation and RACl  expression levels in a large cohort of melanocytic lesions and correlate with pathological features and tumor  progression; Aim 2: To elucidate the downstream targets of activated RACl in melanomas. Aim 3: To  identify small-molecule inhibitors of PAK kinases, the RACl effectors. These studies are likely to provide  new opportunities for drug discovery for melanomas and possibly other cancers that can facilitate patienttailored  targeted therapy."
"9562779","Project Summary  Adolescent (ages 13-18) men who have sex with men (AMSM) experience a dramatic health disparity as they represent 2% of young people but account for almost 80% of HIV diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden, there is a conspicuous lack of evidence-based HIV prevention programs. Implementation issues are critical as traditional HIV prevention delivery channels (community organizations, schools, parents), have significant limitations when it comes to AMSM. eHealth interventions represent an excellent modality for delivering AMSM-specific intervention material where youth ?are.?  We should not continue to deliver the same intervention when a participant is not responding. Rather, stepped-care strategies increase in intensity to meet the needs of those who do not respond to a less intense intervention. Using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, we will evaluate the impact of a package of increasingly intensive interventions that have already shown evidence of efficacy with diverse adolescent and young adult MSM. The SMART design is an ideal approach to achieve the goals of this RFA because SMART designs mimic treatment decisions as they are made in real-world clinical settings. Collectively we brand our package of eHealth interventions as the SMART Program (Sexual Minority Adolescent Risk Taking). The Program package includes: (1) a universally-delivered, brief, online sexual health education program designed for sexual and gender minority youth regardless of whether they are sexually active (Queer Sex Ed); (2) a more intensive online intervention designed for diverse AMSM engaging in HIV transmission risk behaviors (Keep It Up!), and (3) the most intensive is a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention that will be delivered by MI therapists via online videochat (Young Men's Health Project). We will evaluate SMART Program impact and inform future implementation with three specific aims.  Aim 1 is to test impact of the SMART Program and its constituent components on reducing HIV risk and increasing testing among. We will developmentally adapt existing content for AMSM using the ADAPT-ITT framework and linguistically adapt the SMART Program to Spanish speaking Latino AMSM. We will enroll a national sample of 1,878 diverse AMSM and test the efficacy of the Program using a SMART design.  Aim 2 is to test if the SMART Program has differential efficacy across important sub-groups of AMSM based on race/ethnicity, urban/rural, age, socioeconomic status, and language.  Aim 3 is to evaluate the delivery of the SMART Program nationally to inform its implementation and cost-effectiveness. To minimize the science-practice gap, we will utilize mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the SMART Program and its core components by collecting measures from the RE-AIM framework and performing cost analysis."
"9237025","Project Summary Chronic asthma affects millions of people in the United States, and nearly 40% of the asthma patient population is obese and exhibit increased asthma symptoms and severity. Obesity is associated with inflammatory and metabolic changes that can contribute to asthma pathobiology. Specifically, systemic metabolic changes in the obese patient, including increased levels of leptin, a pro-inflammatory mediator secreted by adipose tissue, and decreased responsiveness to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a gut hormone that regulates insulin production may augment pathogenic processes in asthma by acting directly on structural cells in the airway. Airway remodeling describes airway structural changes in asthma that can result in permanent airway obstruction. Airway fibroblasts contribute to this process by migrating to the sub-mucosa, where they proliferate and secrete extracellular matrix. The mechanisms directing airway remodeling in obese asthma are particularly poorly understood, but in allergic asthma, airway remodeling is directed in part by the key TH2 cytokine, interleukin-13 (IL-13). We have shown that IL-13 significantly stimulates airway fibroblast invasion in asthma compared with non-asthma subjects and that this effect is augmented in obese patients. Preliminary data that we present here suggest that leptin enhances airway fibroblast invasion and matrix production and that GLP-1 blocks these effects. Our overarching hypothesis is that leptin and GLP-1 play an important role in the development of airway fibrosis in allergic asthma, providing a link between obesity, glucose metabolism and asthma. The studies described in this proposal will test this hypothesis by identifying the mechanism of leptin-directed pro-fibrotic responses in airway fibroblasts in obese asthma (Aim 1), defining the role of GLP-1 in blocking allergen-induced airway fibrotic processes (Aim 2) and, determine the impact of bariatric surgery and weight loss on airway fibrosis in obese asthma (Aim 3). Successful completion of these Aims will not only increase our understanding of the unique cellular and metabolic mechanisms directing the pathobiology of obese asthma, but will also test specific interventions to treat obese asthma patients."
"9565224","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke Medicine in October, 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Medicine, including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new initiatives, a formula for ongoing investment by the Duke Health System to support ongoing and new DCI initiatives, and additional laboratory and office-based research space. These new commitments were in addition to the clinical space and administrative and Shared Resource lab space already under DCI control and the many laboratories in the Duke School of Medicine and University housing DCI members. The first DCI Executive Director, Michael Kastan, M.D., Ph.D., was hired in August, 2011, followed by major changes in administrative infrastructure, leadership positions and roles, and Cancer Center committees. CCSG Programs and Shared Resources were re-organized, investments were made in high-priority areas, and mechanisms established to more effectively facilitate communication and collaborations among DCI faculty. The DCI, which currently consists of 354 members from 25 departments within 5 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Business), promotes collaborations between faculty and staff involved in cancer care, research, and education within both Duke University and the Duke University Health System. It is organized as 9 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1 population science, and 6 translational) whose work is supported by 13 Shared Resources (8 lab-based and 5 supporting translational/ clinical/ population research activities). On average, approximately 6000 new cancer patients are seen each year at Duke University Hospital (DUH); during the previous 5 calendar years, an average of approximately 1900 patients per year were enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials at DUH and partner sites, the vast majority of which were at DUH. Almost two-thirds of the DCI therapeutic clinical trials represent early phase research (pilot, phase I, phase II). DCI members are supported by over $242M of external cancer- related grant support, $160M of which is peer-reviewed. DCI grant support includes 51 multi-investigator projects and 91 training and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 8000 papers in peer-reviewed journals during the past funding period, ~39% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators (12% intra-program, 21% inter-program, and 6% both). The DCI will continue to utilize effective oversight and strategic planning to integrate all cancer-related activities in it purview, from basic research to translational studies to clinical and population investigation to patient care to community outreach to regional/national strategies to global cancer."
"9369482","Abstract Simultaneous PET/MR can be considered as an integrated imaging modality only if the information of both modalities is integrated together. In current routine PET/MR applications, the PET and MR scans are performed separately, and the images are reconstructed separately as well. The information is integrated only at the application level. Here we propose unified methodologies of joint PET/MR image reconstruction, a paradigm shifting new way to integrate information of PET and MR to significantly maximize the outcome of PET/MR. The PET and MR scanners indeed measure different physical or physiological signals, but there are still redundant information (e.g. tumor boundary and mutual information) between the images obtained with the two modalities that can be utilized to build connection between PET and MR images in a potential joint reconstruction. In addition, if the compartmental model is taken into account, the physiological parameters estimated from PET and MR can have overlaps, and therefore the parametric image (voxel-wise kinetic parameters) estimated from one modality could be directly used to help the estimation of the parametric image of the other modality. Therefore, there are inter- connections between these two modalities that we can use to develop elegant methods of joint reconstruction. We will first take advantage of the simultaneous acquisition of PET/MR to develop a static image reconstruction with anatomic prior derived from MR images, and to develop methods to jointly reconstruct gated PET images using a motion field computed from MR images. We believe in both cases, the quality of PET images will be significantly improved compared to traditional approaches. For PET/MR, there are many novel ways to jointly model the dynamic PET and MR images. We will thus develop an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to directly estimate the voxel-wise kinetic parameters of dynamic PET and dynamic MR together from raw data. This will achieve the maximum signal noise ratio of parametric images for both dynamic PET and MR. We will also investigate novel approaches to parametric imaging of non-stationary kinetic modeling in which not only the images are estimated but also the uncertainty on those estimates of the parametric images. The knowledge of uncertainty is important when making decisions about progression/regression of the disease, signal detection, etc. We will use a method developed in our laboratory in which the noise in raw PET data will be transferred to parameter images using origin ensemble algorithm."

Several unique characteristics distinguish our site as a logical choice for ChiLDReN. These unique characteristics include an established team from pediatric hepatology, pediatric surgery, pediatric radiology, and pediatric pathology that have worked together for >10 years to provide comprehensive care to children with liver disease. We demonstrate that our Center has a large recruitment pool of subjects for current and future ChiLDReN protocols, and the ability to recruit and retain those subjects. For our Scientific Research Plan, unique characteristics include an established nexus for genomic collaborations, innovative tools we will make available to the network, and an existing and robust analytical pipeline for genomic medicine. In Aim 1, we will enroll infants, children, and adolescents in current and future ChiLDReN protocols. For Aim 1, facilities and resources include Primary Children's Hospital and the University of Utah's Center for Clinical and Translational Science. In Aim 2, we will use our innovative genomics pipeline to identify, characterize, and share the genetic causes of liver disease in children. We will provide ChiLDReN with innovative tools and software for genome analysis, including VAAST, a probabilistic gene-finder used widely; pedigree-VAAST, an extension of VAAST that incorporates pedigree data; PHEVOR, a new algorithm for incorporating phenotypes into genome analyses; and Opal, which provides a fast and easy-to-use analysis environment for collaborative genome interpretation across ChiLDReN. Accomplishing these aims as a collaborative member of ChiLDReN will lead to new knowledge regarding the biology, natural history, etiology, and therapy of liver diseases that affect children, and improve the diagnostic and management options for patients afflicted with them."
"9361133","Extensive evidence from animal model and epidemiological studies has linked prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) to a broad range of cognitive and behavioral deficits, growth impairment, and physical anomalies. However, to date there has been no systematic attempt to use sophisticated meta-analytic techniques to integrate data across studies to improve identification of affected individuals, and virtually no information is available regarding the levels of exposure associated with an increased risk of clinically meaningful adverse effects. The aim of this study is integrate extensive data collected from five large prospective longitudinal cohorts to better define the nature of the adverse effects associated with PAE and to derive more reliable and robust estimates of effect size and critical dose. Although these five studies were conducted independently, there was substantial convergence in the approaches used to measure exposure and developmental outcomes. Three complementary approaches?Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis, structural equation modeling, and growth curve modeling?will be used to evaluate effect size in four domains: cognitive function, externalizing behavior problems, growth, and physical anomalies. These analyses will also consider the degree to which (a) larger effect sizes are associated with greater average daily dose vs. dose/occasion; (b) larger effect sizes are associated with drinking earlier vs. later in pregnancy; (c) effect sizes within these domains are stable or increase or attenuate across development; (d) effect sizes differ for different aspects of cognition (e.g., IQ, learning and memory, executive function) and behavioral function (e.g., aggression, social problems); and (e) effect sizes are moderated by maternal age at delivery, history of alcohol use disorders, and/or body mass index. In addition, we will (a) examine the shape of the dose-response curves to identify nonlinearities and inflection points that may suggest threshold effects; (b) use benchmark dose analysis to determine critical doses of PAE at which there is an increased likelihood of clinically significant adverse effects; and (c) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of critical doses suggested by these analyses for predicting a range of developmental outcomes. This project will be conducted by a team of leading fetal alcohol researchers in collaboration with an internationally respected biostatistician. The proposal is responsive to NIAAA PAR-14- 338, Secondary Analyses of Existing Alcohol Epidemiology Data, which highlights the application ?of new analytic techniques and statistical methods for alcohol research? to ?currently available data sets? to ?help develop accurate measurement of?risk relationship and outcomes of alcohol consumption [and] to establish reliable and plausible thresholds.?

"9450137","Abstract  This proposal addresses the relationship between African American (AA) and basal-like breast cancers,  obesity, and environmental factors through a novel metabolically-regulated pathway that we have recently  shown drives aggressive tumor cell behaviors. Combining in vitro studies with patient biopsy data and  computational analyses, we will characterize the regulation and function of the widely expressed lipolysis  stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) in normal and transformed breast cells and tissue. LSR is a  multifunctional protein known to mediate the endocytosis of lipoproteins and hydrophobic environmental  toxicants such as benzo[?]pyrene in hepatocytes. Intriguingly, LSR is enriched at cell junctions and we are the  first to show LSR is frequently translocated to the cell nucleus of non-surviving breast cancer (BrCa) patients.  The function and underlying molecular mechanisms for these observations are unknown. Of note, studies  show bodily accumulation of toxicants obtained through the diet promotes obesity and inflammation, and  toxicant bioaccumulation higher in AAs and in low-income communities. Thus, we hypothesize that LSR  expression and/or activity enhances aggressive BrCa phenotypes via modulation of cellular bioenergetics,  toxicant bioaccumulation, and altered signal transduction and transcriptome regulation, thereby contributing to  cancer disparities and poor patient outcome. In support, we recently demonstrated that LSR increases BrCa  proliferation and migration, and enhances cancer stem cell-like and chemotherapeutic resistance features.  Overexpression of LSR in a claudin-low BrCa cell line restores expression of genes involved in transformation,  tumorigenesis, and tight junctions, thereby reverting these cells to other BrCa subtypes. Our pilot data show  high LSR levels are significantly correlated with basal-like tumors, AA ethnicity, and diet-induced obesity. Our  preliminary data also demonstrate that membrane-localized LSR mediates lipid endocytosis, thereby shifting  cellular bioenergetics, while nuclear LSR binds DNA and was significantly associated with patient mortality in a  pilot set of BrCa biopsies. To advance these preliminary studies we propose a dual approach, which includes  delineating LSR's role in driving aggressive BrCa behaviors together with defining the molecular mechanisms  of toxicant uptake and promotion inflammation in breast tissue. Specifically, we aims to (1) identify the LSR-  driven pathways exploited during BrCa progression and the generation of aggressive cell behaviors, and (2)  define the mechanisms of LSR-mediated lipid and toxicant uptake in BrCa cells, and the resultant effects on  cancer bioenergetics and cell physiology. Our proposal may shed light on LSR as a biological link between  obesity, inflammation, cancer disparities, and BrCa physiology. Novel knowledge obtained from the proposed  studies will provide critical insight into the biological basis of dietary influences on breast cancer and may  identify the LSR as a novel therapeutic target."
"9402379","PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic approaches are poised to revolutionize medicine by providing the basis for precision therapies and diagnostics, but it remains difficult and in many cases impossible to interpret genomic data without knowledge of the clinical situation. Phenomics is a new field that aims to collect, exchange, and analyze clinical phenotype data and integrate it into the clinical and translational assessment of genomics data. A critical challenge for genomic medicine is therefore to identify the genetic etiologies and environmental factors that underlie Mendelian disease, cancer, and common and complex diseases. However, interpretation of genomic data requires a fundamental understanding of phenotypic data, as well as new algorithms, tools, and data structures that can operate on them. Here, we propose to create the Forums For Integrative Phenomics (FFIP) to enable and accelerate scientific discoveries for maximizing use of phenotypic data across the translational landscape for improved patient care, and for precision medicine. FFIP events will governed by Phenopackets, a community-based organization with currently >400 members spanning diverse stakeholder groups whose vision is to develop and promote Open and Computable Knowledge-sharing Technologies designed for capturing, sharing, and exploiting structured bioinformatic phenotype knowledge. The FFIP events will enable phenomics researchers from different areas and roles in basic, clinical, and translational research to share their ideas, tools, algorithms and data in order to address these shared challenges. For each of three years, the FFIP will facilitate one annual meeting coupled with three community workshops and hackathons. All events will focus on state-of-the-art approaches for phenotype data analysis that complement and work synergistically with genomic analyses. FFIP events will facilitate the development of and training in emerging software and standards for Big Data in phenomics, and will foster collaboration amongst young researchers, underrepresented minorities, women, and those in less prominent or traditional research roles. A key theme will be transitioning from traditional, low-throughput methods of measuring and reporting phenotypes towards big-data approaches. The FFIP events will therefore enable participants to contribute to, access, integrate, and analyze diverse phenomic data that will enable diagnoses, treatment selection, and new discoveries."

"9440054","It is well established that patients diagnosed with highly metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) have disease characterized by invasion of carcinoma cells into the lymphatic system, skin and axilla. High local recurrence rates on the chest wall and in the un-dissected regional nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy and radiation are well-documented and attributed to persistence of treatment resistant cells in the skin and residual lymphatics. Numerous genomic studies including recently presented next-generation sequencing demonstrate significant overlap with non-IBC cases suggesting non-genomic factors may influence the unique features of IBC. Together with studies showing that explicitly show non-tumor cells influence the IBC specific features of the tumor cells led us to investigate non-tumor factors to identify important targets in the microenvironment in IBC. Wound fluid obtained from post-surgical tumor cavities in non-IBC has recently been suggested to modulate biological activities in the tumor bed. In the present proposal, we aim to characterize cellular and proteomic components of the wound healing fluid collected during: 1) hemostasis/inflammatory; and 2) proliferating/tissue remodeling phases from non-IBC and IBC patients undergoing breast mastectomy. Wound fluid collected from benign breast lesions and mammoplasty will be used as control. First, we will collect the wound healing fluid to characterize epithelial and immunological cellular components using flow cytometric analysis. The proteomic profile of different phases of wound healing fluid will be assessed using cytokine antibody array. Since dynamic remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays crucial role in cancer recurrence and dissemination, we will then develop 3D organotypic mammosphere (OMS) in-vitro culture model derived from patients? carcinoma tissues to test how wound healing fluid may regulate ECM remodeling. OMS will be seeded in media conditioned by wound fluid collected at different phases of the wound healing. After appropriate time of incubation, OMS will be subjected to RT Profiler PCR Array that simultaneously detects the expression of 84 genes involved in ECM remodeling and cell adhesion. Finally, we plan to validate significant candidates identified from these steps in independent data at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our study is critically important as the low survival rates of breast cancer in Egypt, especially among IBC patients, indicates a pressing need to develop collaborative research programs that can be of immediate assistance to patients. We anticipate that our findings will identify biological factors in the IBC wound fluid that may contribute to the dissemination of carcinoma cells all over the body and make the disease resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. The proposed research will be conducted primarily in Cairo, Egypt by faculty at Cairo University and Ain Shams University with collaborative engagement and support from colleagues at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas and University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland."

"9444753","Project Summary Neuromodulation mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) regulates many brain functions. Dysfunction of mGluR modulation is associated with multiple brain disorders, and drugs targeting mGluRs have been developed for their treatment. However, the functions of mGluRs in the auditory system are poorly understood. In the absence of such knowledge, an understanding of the mechanisms underlying auditory processing and the potential to develop clinically useful strategies targeting mGluRs to prevent or treat hearing disorders will remain limited. The objective in this application is to determine the roles of mGluRs in the auditory brainstem circuit that analyze interaural time differences (ITD) for sound localization. Formulated based upon the previous work and strong preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory, the central hypotheses are that 1) mGluRs improve auditory processing by modulating synaptic and intrinsic neuronal properties; 2) hearing deprivation results in plasticity of mGluR modulation; and 3) dysfunctional mGluR modulation leads to compromised auditory processing. These hypotheses will be tested in both avian and mammalian models, utilizing the advantages of each animal model that are not prominent in the other. Furthermore, we will take advantage of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder in which exaggerated activity of mGluRs is the core underlying mechanism, to test the hypothesis that dysfunctional mGluR modulation contributes to compromised auditory processing. In vitro physiology (whole-cell and perforated patch recording and sharp electrode recording in brain slices), optical imaging (voltage-sensitive dye and Ca2+ imaging) combined with pharmacological tools, and immunohistochemistry will be used to determine the roles of mGluR modulation in the ITD circuit in normal hearing and hearing-deprived chicks, and in normal hearing and FXS mice. The successful completion of the proposed research will provide in-depth understanding of the roles of mGluRs in sound localization circuits, and may inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in hearing disorders."
"9418229","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite the 11.4 million Mexican immigrants living in the U.S., the biological and behavioral determinants that contribute to cancer disparities among them are vastly understudied. While research has indicated that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) influence cancer in adulthood, this association has not been investigated among Mexican immigrants. In addition, exposure to minority stress is associated with poor physical adult health outcomes. This association is particularly important for Mexican immigrants, as they are exposed to a disproportionate number of stressors associated with their minority status that are stigmatizing and discriminatory. It is believed that minority-related stressors are unique (i.e., not experienced by non- stigmatized populations), additive, chronic, and socially based. The repeated or chronic stress of ACE, such as living in poverty, or ongoing adult experiences associated with minority stress, such as pressure to acculturate, can lead to dysregulation of biological systems and harmful health behaviors. Biological and behavioral stress responses, such as the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, elevated adiposity, alcoholism, and risky sexual activity are associated with cancer development in adulthood. The goal of this study is to evaluate the association of ACE, minority stress and their combination with cancer risk factors among Mexican immigrants. This study will pursue three primary aims: (1) Evaluate cancer risk factors in relation to the adversity that occurred in childhood; (2) Evaluate cancer risk factors in adulthood in relation to minority stress; and (3) Determine the extent to which biological and behavioral cancer risk factors increase as a result of the additive effect of ACE and minority stress in adulthood. This proof-of-concept study will enroll 50 Mexican immigrants (aged 19-49 years) who reside in the Houston area. The ACE survey will be used to retrospectively measure stress during childhood, and the Multidimensional Acculturative Stress Inventory (MASI) will be used to measure minority stress. Direct assessment will be used to measure 11 pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, and TNF?) and three adiposity measures (body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference).This study is highly innovative for three primary reasons: (1) It focuses on a population that experiences cancer disparities but is rarely included in interdisciplinary research; (2) It uses an interdisciplinary framework that embeds Cumulative Risk Theory and Minority Stress Theory into a Life Course Perspective to understand the impact of social stress on cancer risk; and (3) It uses multiple biological and behavioral measurements to provide a more complete understanding of how stress influences cancer risk. It is envisioned that this study will expand an interdisciplinary research program aimed at investigating biological and behavioral influences on cancer risk factors. The findings from the proof-of-concept study will be used to help design a larger scale study that will advance research and modify cancer prevention strategies."
"9423662","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 18 million Americans abuse alcohol, with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) affecting over 10 million people. Alcohol abuse's deleterious effects on the liver leads to pathologically distinct entities including steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis; patients can develop alcoholic hepatitis (AH) at any time in the progression of disease. AH is the most severe form of ALD and only occurs in a sub-set of heavy drinkers, suggesting a role for genetic and environmental risk factors. AH is a particularly costly presentation of ALD; treatment costs are estimated to be ~$40K per patient with average length of stay in hospital lasting 6-9 days. While the standard therapy for severe AH is glucocorticoids, many patients are steroid-resistant; steroid- resistant patients have a 6 month mortality rate greater than 45%. Also of critical importance, there is no currently approved treatment for patients with moderate AH; 28 day mortality in moderate AH is ~10-15%. NIAAA recognized the great need to develop rationally-based therapies of AH and established the Alcoholic Hepatitis Consortia (ASH UO1) in 2012/2013, funding four independent consortia to conduct clinical and translational studies in patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. While each consortia developed independent clinical approaches, the collection of genetic material, as well as an extensive phenotypic analysis of all patients, was a common theme amongst the four groups. We are now combining the efforts of all 4 consortia in order to leverage these critical biospecimens and clinical data into a single cohort large enough for investigations into the genetic contributions to AH. In order to carry out a thorough genetic analysis, here we propose an extramural/intramural collaboration (PAR-16-104 Program for Extramural/ Intramural Alcohol Research Collaborations (U01)) with Dr. David Goldman in the Laboratory of Neuro Genetics (LNG) at NIAAA. Dr. Goldman and his team have extensive expertise in whole exome sequencing and analysis of allele frequencies related to alcohol abuse. The combination of the extensive biorepository and phenotypic data from the ASH UO1 consortia with the expertise of the intramural LNG uniquely qualifies our team to identify critical genetic components leading to AH, as well as the sensitivity to therapeutic intervention. Identification of specific genetic components will likely provide insights into why only a subset of patients who abuse alcohol develop AH and identify potential druggable molecular drivers. Here we propose to carry out the following Specific Aims: 1) Whole exome sequencing of the DNA from ~1000 patients with AH, as well as a cohort of heavy drinking controls without liver disease and 2) Novel analytical approaches to determine genetic risk for key determinants of AH including a) Susceptibility for developing AH among heavy drinkers, b) Risk for early mortality from AH, c) Response to therapy and d) Alcohol Recidivism. In summary, the combination of our well-characterized unique population of heavy drinkers with and without AH with our bioinformatics expertise will enable our consortium to identify key genetic determinants for determining risk for and survival after AH."
"9314540","SUMMARY Project 3 will develop new computational tools for understanding how gut microbial communities change their membership, gene content, gene expression, and metabolic activities in obesity and during diet interventions, in both humans and 'humanized' gnotobiotic mouse models. Its overarching goals are to: (i) understand the levels at which multi-omics data should be collected and analyzed in order to maximize our understanding of complex multifactorial pathophysiological conditions such as obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities; (ii) develop improved genome assembly techniques and predictions about culture conditions and syntrophic interactions to improve the utility of personalized bacterial culture collections and data derived from them; and (iii) understand how best to characterize the diversity of gut microbial communities, and the functional profiles of these communities, observed in the human population and use them for patient stratification. Project 3 has three Aims: (1) develop new tools for relating multi-omics data across analysis levels and relating information from mouse models, specifically gnotobiotic humanized mice characterized in Project 1 and Core A, to information about the discordant twins (phenotyped in Project 2 and Core A) from which those animal models were derived and to the human population at large; (2) to develop improved methods for assembly of complete bacterial genomes as a reference for shotgun metagenomic and meta- transcriptomic data, including meta-transcriptome data collected from gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial culture collections generated from the fecal microbiota of co-twins in discordant twin pairs where the complete bacterial genomes are known, thus eliminating a major computational bottleneck and providing more relevant types of assemblies for downstream annotation and interpretation tasks; and (3) to provide a broader understanding of the major patterns of variation in human gut microbial communities and their genes, transcripts and metabolites in individuals with and without obesity and obesity associated abnormalities, and to test whether these major patterns can be used for stratification of human subjects in terms of their response to specific dietary or other interventions. Project 3 and Core B will work closely together to make new analysis tools and datasets available to the scientific community."
"9567364","Project Summary Computational docking is an essential tool for analysis of biomolecular structure and function and for the discovery and development of new bioactive compounds. In particular, virtual screening is now widely used to discover new compounds to bind and inhibit targets of medicinal interest. The AutoDock Suite of programs is currently the most widely used, freely-available method for automated computational docking. This success is the result of several aspects of the work performed under the previous granting period: the continued development of the method to address problems of interest in the community, such as covalent docking and active site prediction, and the development of user-friendly interfaces and user support that ensure that the method is accessible to the widest community possible. As a result of this work, we have seen adoption and extension of the AutoDock suite by expert users, using the suite as a platform for research in computational chemistry and algorithm development, in parallel with widespread application by experimental chemists and molecular biologists who are not experts in computational chemistry. In the proposed work, we will develop AutoDock into a next generation tool for drug design and discovery. This will include extensions of the methods of AutoDock to address the expanding and varied needs of a large user community. We will develop new methods for ligand design that allow to generate novel compounds, employing specific constraints that will ensure that such compounds are synthetically accessible, and predicted to have desirable pharmacological properties. We will also continue and expand our strong commitment to user support, creating interfaces that streamline use of the AutoDock suite by the user community, and providing effective support and training."
"9356796","Career Enhancement Program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The central goal of the Career Enhancement Program (CEP) is to use the resources at MD Anderson to train exceptional young investigators who will reduce the morbidity and mortality from ovarian cancer through making advances in the early detection, prevention, and treatment of this disease. To achieve this goal, the SPORE CEP will provide two awards, each of $50,000 annually for two years, funded from the SPORE and matching funds from MD Anderson. The intent of each CEP award is to prepare the selected scientists to become international leaders in academic research relevant to ovarian cancer. We will achieve this by aggressive recruitment of the most promising young investigators and the institution of an individualized development plan with clinical and a laboratory mentors and a mentoring committee, formal course work, coaching in grant and paper writing, leadership training, attendance at national meetings, networking with ovarian cancer scholars and completing and publishing a translational ovarian cancer research program. During our past SPORE awards, the CEP has developed the careers of 21 young investigators. In the first year of the original grant, three postdoctoral trainees received CE awards, and of the 18 faculty members supported since 2000, all have remained in academic research and 13 are engaged predominantly in ovarian cancer research. Ten have achieved peer-reviewed funding and two additional awardees have received competitive foundation grants. The six awardees in the most recently funded cycle received one R01, one R03, two CPRIT awards, two Texas Center for Nanotechnology Grants, one Liz Tilberis Scholar Award from the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund and one Susan Poorman Blackie Ovarian Cancer grant. After entering the program, awardees have published over 500 peer-reviewed papers regarding ovarian cancer. Of the faculty awardees, five are project leaders, co-investigators, collaborators or core leaders on the current SPORE (Drs. Anil Sood, Jinsong Liu, KK Wong, Vikas Kundra, and Guang Peng). Moving forward, the CEP will be led by Dr. Anil Sood, who is an outstanding role model and most effective mentor."
"9424919","Project Summary/Abstract  A diverse biomedical and behavioral workforce is essential to the health of the nation, yet retention of diverse trainees in research careers has proven challenging. Mentor training is one intervention that has shown promise in helping ensure that diverse trainees persist in their career path; fostering identity as a scientist is another. The objective of the Scientific Communication Advances Research Excellence (SCOARE) program is to provide research mentors with knowledge and skills to mentor their diverse trainees effectively in the principles and practices of scientific communication, foundational skills for success in research careers. The SCOARE curriculum design integrates elements based on research showing that trainees raised speaking racial or ethnic varieties of English may experience the research environment differently than others, and that effective mentoring in the practice of speaking, writing, and presenting influences trainees? intentions to persist in research careers. The long-term goal of SCOARE is to strengthen career intention and build capacity of diverse research trainees by providing their mentors with SciComm training. In Aim 1, a mentor workshop will be designed to equip participants with knowledge of why and how trainee SciComm skills interact with productivity, outcome expectations, racial/ethnic identity, and career intention; explain the principles of SciComm acquisition; provide mentors with feasible and effective practices for improved mentoring; and provide continued reinforcement and support online. For Aim 2, evaluations of the workshops and online resources will measure both mentor implementation of new practices and mentee gains in productivity, outcome expectations, career intention, and increased sense of comfort in the research environment. In Aim 3, evaluation results will inform the design and development of a facilitator training program, and former workshop participants will have the opportunity to learn to deliver the workshops to others, thereby extending the program?s reach. The curriculum and materials for both workshops will be made publicly available, and evaluation results will be disseminated. Outcomes for this program include 1) fully developed and evaluated SciComm mentoring workshops; 2) a fully developed and evaluated SciComm facilitator training; and 3) a total of at least 500 mentors trained and 45 SCOARE Facilitators trained. The program will be significant because it will empower mentors to employ SciComm skill development to train a research workforce that is both skilled in communication and diverse; it will be innovative because it is grounded in linguistic, pedagogical, and social-cognitive evidence that addresses powerful links among language, motivation, and identity. Its impact will be to help retain trainees in research careers and thus build a diverse biomedical and behavioral workforce possessing superior training and high professional commitment, thus aligning with NIGMS goals and providing a return on their original research investment."

"9437389","Project Summary Understanding the molecular and cellular basis for behavior depends on a rigorous assessment of the contributions of different neuron types. Progress in elucidating neural circuits for behaviors is often hampered by a lack of genetic tools for efficiently generating animals with cell-type specific expression of genes that can be used to perturb or monitor neuronal activity, such as optogenetic tools, tetanus toxin, and GCaMP. Also, there has been steady progress in optogenetics and genetically-encoded sensors such as GCaMP calcium indicators, but it is impractical to rebuild hundreds of strains inserting each improved version into a repertoire of expression vectors. One elegant method that addresses both issues simultaneously is to use a bipartite expression system, which separates the cell-type control from the effector, and thus a set of cell-type specific drivers can be reused with different versions of effectors (e.g., GCaMP6 versus GCaMP3). Conversely, a set of strains might be made with a promoter that directs expression in two or more cell types; if a more specific regulatory sequence is identified, then all the constructs have to be rebuilt. With a bipartite system, construction of a single Driver with the new regulatory sequence can easily combined with all the available Effectors to efficiently generate the strains needed. allows use of all the Effectors. For example, Drosophila researchers have made great use of the Gal4-UAS system in which a transcriptional activator protein (Gal4) is expressed in the cell type(s) of interest and binds to its target sequence ? the UAS ? to direct expression of an effector gene of interest. This scheme allows many combinations of specifically expressed genes to be built from a much smaller number of transgenes. However, Caenorhabditis elegans has not had such a system until our recent development of the cGAL system, an optimized Gal4-UAS system. One key feature of our implementation is the use of the DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 protein from a yeast species whose optimal growth temperature matches that of C. elegans, thereby allowing more efficient target gene activation. We also showed that the cGAL system can be applied to functional studies in C. elegans. We propose to construct an initial neuronal cGAL toolkit, and apply it to one circuit as proof of principle. The chosen circuit is male mating behavior, arguably the most complex of C. elegans behaviors as it involves almost the entire nervous system and a complex series of steps each involving sensory-motor integration. While the roles of many male specific neurons have been identified, the roles of non-sex-specific neurons have not; our approach will make the cGAL reagents that render all of the non-sex-specific neurons tractable to analysis in a systematic way. At the end of two years, we will have fully introduced a useful bipartite expression system to the C. elegans community and refined our understanding of innate behavior."
"9431581","Dr. Wayland Cheng is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with the long-term goal of being an independent investigator in anesthetic pharmacology. His research background is in the field of ion channel biophysics, and his interest is in the interaction of anesthetics with pentameric ligand gated ion channels (pLGICs) with a focus on neurosteroids. Neurosteroids are endogenous brain sterols that potently modulate GABAA receptors (GABAARs), and are being developed as anesthetics or treatments of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Although neurosteroid modulation of the GABAAR has been well characterized, neurosteroid binding to the GABAAR is not well understood. A detailed understanding of the stoichiometry/site(s), orientation and pharmacology of neurosteroid binding to the GABAAR is essential for structure-based drug design. To address this deficiency, the candidate will apply photo-affinity labeling with an existing library of neurosteroid photolabeling reagents, and top-down mass spectrometry (MS), a technique that analyzes intact membrane proteins, to characterize neurosteroid photolabeling of the GABAAR. Aim 1 is to determine the stoichiometry/site(s), orientation and pharmacophore of neurosteroid photolabeling of ELIC-GABAAR chimeras (tractable model proteins where the transmembrane domain consists of GABAAR subunits). Aim 2 is to determine the stoichiometry of neurosteroid photolabeling of ?1?3?2 GABAARs proteoforms (intact proteins and all associated modifications), and to test whether certain proteoforms are preferentially photolabeled by neurosteroids. This work will yield novel insights into the structural basis of neurosteroid binding to the GABAAR. It will also establish a generalizable method using top-down MS for characterizing small molecule photolabeling of membrane proteins, and is anticipated to lead to sustainable R01-level funding. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Alex Evers, an expert in anesthetic pharmacology, photo-affinity labeling and bottom-up mass spectrometry. The candidate will also be working closely with Dr. Michael Gross and Dr. Julian Whitelegge, both renowned leaders in top-down MS of membrane proteins. The Anesthesiology Department at Washington University provides a robust environment for research in molecular pharmacology. Furthermore, the candidate utilizes an Elite mass spectrometer owned by Dr. Evers, and has full access to the Washington University NIH NIGMS Mass Spectrometry Research Resource led by Dr. Gross, which provides state-of-the-art MS technology for high mass and high resolution measurements."
"9384170","Abstract Our goal is to provide novel, clinically feasible, and precise diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tech- nologies for investigation of the in-vivo human brain's cellular microstructure in early psychosis. Psychotic dis- orders are devastating brain diseases that include a range of symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorder. A better understanding of the etiology of psychosis can lead to improved diagnosis and treatment. dMRI is a noninvasive imaging method that has identified unique microstructural abnormalities in psychosis. However, as many pathological processes have been proposed to co-exist in psychosis, there is a need for more specific measures derived from dMRI. Current state-of-the-art dMRI encodes (measures) diffusion along a single direction using a technique called single diffusion encoding. We propose q-space trajectory imaging (QTI), a new dMRI method that dynamically changes the measurement orientation during acquisition to better characterize the true complexity of water molecule motion. The novel QTI sequences that we propose allow measurement of microstructural properties of the in-vivo human brain that are invisible using today's scanning methods. These microstructural properties are mathematically expressed in terms of variability in size (CMD), shape (C), and orientation (Cc), extracted from a model representing a mixture of distinct neuronal tissue microenvironments, such as neurites, cellular domains and extracellular spaces. To achieve our goals we propose the following three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop experimental foundations for novel dMRI. We will investigate QTI methodologies to better characterize important pathological features expected in psychosis. We will extend the QTI framework to enable microstructural models and properties that explicitly account for restricted, non-Gaussian, and time-dependent diffusion. The successful endpoint of this aim will provide measures and models for the extraction of new microstructural properties related to psychosis from QTI. In Aim 2, we will develop novel dMRI sequences and standards. We propose to develop robust and fast QTI pulse sequences and scan protocols, with representation of the acquisition parameters in DICOM. The successful endpoint of this aim will be novel, robust, and fast acquisitions (under 15 minutes), enabling QTI for clinical studies. In Aim 3, we propose to study QTI-based microstructure measures in 24 early psychosis pa- tients and 24 matched controls to disentangle pathologies that co-exist in psychosis, such as neurodegenera- tive and neuroinflammatory processes. We expect that upon successful completion of the proposed project, we will have developed novel dMRI to provide increased sensitivity and specificity for the study of the in-vivo human brain's cellular microstructure."
"9377593","Project Summary Birth-related outcomes, specifically cesarean section rates, gestational age, and birth weight, indicate maternal and child health, and have life-long impacts on the health of children. Home visiting (HV) is an established approach to improve the health of children and families, parenting practices, and linkage to social and health services. The majority of HV programs target first-time mothers, in part due to the assumption that later children will also benefit. HV goals and activities in the second preconception, and possibly prenatal, period have the potential to improve second child birth outcomes. However, there are sparse data on subsequent birth outcomes; programs that engage mothers during pregnancy focus on the first child and other programs engage mothers around the time of the first child's birth and do not focus on any birth outcomes. We propose to use data from a statewide HV program (Nurturing Families Network [NFN]) and birth certificates to examine second births to home visited mothers. NFN enrolls most mothers shortly after the birth of their first child and uses the evidence-based Parent as Teacher (PAT) curriculum. The availability of these NFN data provides an opportunity to examine a large community-based program without costly data collection. Birth certificate data will be used to create comparison groups for this observational study. Birth outcomes for the NFN second children (n=3,000 children) will be compared to: (a) their older siblings (the child whose birth led to enrollment in NFN; n=3,000), (b) children of families who were screened as eligible for NFN, but not offered the program due to home visitor availability and other logistical reasons (n=650), and (c) a propensity-score-matched group of non-NFN children (created using the likelihood to enroll in the program based on maternal health, individual demographics, and neighborhood characteristics; n=6,000). We will examine birth spacing, receipt of prenatal care, cesarean section rate, gestational age, and birth weight for second children of NFN families, compared to the groups described above. We will conduct sub-analyses by race and by age (<20 vs. ?20 years) to examine differences for mothers in vulnerable groups. We will also examine program engagement (dropout and missed visits) for those enrolled in NFN and associations between program engagement and birth outcomes. This project will generate evidence on the potential long-term benefits of a statewide program to the second child of home-visited mothers. This evidence is important to support continued funding of these programs and to determine if the assumption that later children will gain benefits justifies the focus on first-time mothers. Understanding the impact of program engagement on later outcomes will help the program prioritize retention efforts. This project will strengthen the research environment of the Yale School of Nursing by providing students an opportunity to engage in secondary data analysis and by building expertise in the school for conducting research using large administrative datasets and utilizing advanced statistical methods."

A scalable bioinformatics pipeline will be developed to collect, manage, analyze and visualize brain region-specific, whole- genome DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) within the comprehensive context of the mouse brain, achieving integration of cell type-specific molecular data with anatomical data. In parallel, the CEMBA Data Core will develop a dynamic, web-based informatics platform that facilitates the collection, analysis, and visualization of cell-type specific connectivity data. Further, the use of novel informatics tools will enable synchronization of cell type-specific epigenetic networks with neural networks. Finally, all of these data will be presented through intuitive online visualization tools, allowing users to view and analyze the information within the Allen Reference Atlas neuroanatomy framework. The CEMBA-DC will be the primary point of contact within the broader BICCN, including the Brain Cell Data Center (BCDC) U24 program. The CEMBA Data Core will work together with the BCDC and other investigators to harmonize nomenclature and semantic structures."

"9422521","Technology Core Summary: The Advancing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging (ARMADA) Technology (Tech) Core will support the establishment of the measurement properties of the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIHTB) in older adults (85+ years) and adults over age 65 with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) or early Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The Tech Core will provide technical oversight and development across all cores and the nine data collection sites, and will facilitate and support the integration of ARMADA data within the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; PI: Kukull). This will be accomplished via three aims: 1) Deliver the technology infrastructure necessary to support assessment administration and data management; 2) Integrate newly developed or modified existing measures assessing cognitive and sensory functions into the existing NIHTB platform; and 3) Curate measures and instrumentation to ensure correct software functioning through changes in platform and evolution of commercial devices. The Tech Core will install English and Spanish versions of the NIHTB iPad app on new iPads, and deliver the configured devices along with requisite supporting hardware and documentation to each of the data collection sites. The sites will be provided with hardware and software support, maintenance and upgrades, security and backup monitoring, and technical support throughout the data collection period. The Tech Core will enable sites to administer the NIHTB in clinic, or at home, and enable local backup and ensure data transfer to the NACC. The Core will work with Research Project Core scientists to develop new or modify existing measures to supplement the NIHTB and then implement these measures into the existing NIHTB platform in both English and Spanish versions (i.e. the NIHTB+). The NIHTB+ will be created to take advantage of standard NIHTB data structures and ultimately enable automated scoring, normative lookups, and integration into existing NIHTB exports and reports. New measures will be added to existing administration manuals, FAQs, scoring manuals and other support documents. The Tech Core will manage technological needs of new and existing instrument implementation by use of established support processes, tools and expertise. This will include hardware and software monitoring, software maintenance and upgrades, security and backup process implementation, and the provision of basic technical support. Quality Assurance specialists will test the NIHTB+ app for each iOS release, and appropriate upgrades will be made available."
"9467963","ABSTRACT Alcoholism carries significant personal and societal burdens, and yet we still lack effective treatments for alcohol use disorders. Several lines of research have demonstrated disruption of white matter (WM) in major tracts throughout the alcoholic brain. However, we know very little about how reward-related pathways are affected. Understanding the morphology of the alcoholic brain, particularly in projections to reward-related regions, is imperative to our understanding of the mechanisms that may underlie alcohol dependence and relapse. Therefore, our goal is to determine how WM structure of reward pathways relates to drinking behavior and neurochemical function (in particular, dopamine (DA), which is an important neurotransmitter in alcohol abuse and dependence). In order to achieve this goal, we will utilize a novel multi-modal neuroimaging approach by collecting both diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dopaminergic positron emission tomography (PET) in the same subjects. Data from previous and ongoing NIH-funded studies will be analyzed, with final target samples of 91 nontreatment-seeking alcoholics (NTS) and 101 social drinkers (SD). DWI with tractography will be used to characterize the WM structure of reward pathways with cutting-edge connectomic metrics (e.g., number of fibers of a connection, fiber density), and variables from network-based algorithms (which give information about how efficient connections are between brain regions). Aim 1 will determine how connectomic and network metrics of reward-related WM pathways relate to drinking behaviors. Aim 2 will use a multimodal DWI/PET approach in order to determine how properties of reward-related WM projections (e.g., fractional anisotropy, connectomic indices, network efficiency) may differentially affect DA tone in NTS and SD. Specifically, we will test whether WM properties of cortico-striatal projections alter striatal DA tone (measured with [11C]raclopride) and whether thalamo-cortical WM tracts affect prefrontal cortical DA tone (measured with [18F]fallypride). The results of this study will greatly improve our understanding of how WM structure in reward pathways may contribute to alcoholism, and will facilitate future treatment development based on the relationships between brain structure, drinking behavior, and neurochemical function."
"9484588","This application proposes an interdisciplinary Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO), with the unifying theme of conducting and promoting multi-level community-based participatory research to prevent SAVA syndemic conditions (substance abuse, violence/trauma and HIV/AIDS) and reduce their adverse health and mental health consequences. The emphasis of the Center will be on tailored interventions for Latino subgroups who represent pockets of vulnerability and require precise and specialized interventions that optimize access to and impact of interventions. CLaRO will unite and advance the work undertaken during the past decade by two NIMHD Centers of Excellence: the P60 Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research (El Centro), at the University of Miami (UM), and the P20 Center of Excellence within the Center for Research on US Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA), at Florida International University (FIU). Both originating centers have well-established research infrastructures and strong records of achievement in translating research findings into meaningful, culturally relevant clinical practice for vulnerable Latinos. In this application, we propose two behavioral intervention studies, each of which advances the work of the existing collaborating Centers of Excellence. Research Project 1 will develop a culturally tailored intervention directed at preventing and reducing SAVA conditions among seasonal farmworker men and will be packaged, in collaboration with the Community/Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB), for community dissemination. Research Project 2 adapts and tests an intervention, developed at El Centro, for preventing and reducing self-harm and other SAVA-related behaviors in Latina and sexual/gender minority youth. The two Research Projects will be integrated through a common set of data points to measure risk and protective factors, moderators, and SAVA indicators related to the CLaRO theme. The common data elements will be expanded as CLaRO evolves to include biological and community-level measures. This application leverages the success of the originating Centers of Excellence and considerable institutional resources to advance investigator development at the applicant institution (UM). We propose a Pilot Projects Program, which will be articulated with scientific resources, training and mentorship, and will fund up to 35 studies, serving as an engine for the advancement of early-stage investigators and for diversifying the workforce of successful health disparities investigators. The CLaRO theme, agenda, and priorities were developed in collaboration with a network of community partners who will play an ongoing role in guiding and disseminating CLaRO science and advancing neighborhood capacity building and multilevel interventions to promote health in Latino communities. Miami-Dade County? with its large and diverse Latino population, who face individual, social and structural risk factors and have high prevalence of substance abuse, HIV and violence/trauma?provides the ideal laboratory for advancing the science of Latino health and health disparities."
"9309513","PROJECT SUMMARY MPS1 encodes a conserved kinase that is essential for multiple cell cycle related functions. One critical role for Mps1 is to promote the formation of force-generating associations of kinetochores with microtubules in meiosis. These connections are critical for chromosomes to become properly oriented on the meiotic spindle, but the molecular mechanisms by which Mps1 forms these associations is a mystery. Errors in meiotic chromosome bi-orientation lead to gametes with the wrong number of chromosomes, referred to as aneuploidy, which in humans is the leading cause of birth defects and mental retardation. Mps1 is necessary to prevent this aneuploidy, as loss of Mps1 leads to high levels of aneuploid gametes. Mps1 is also implicated in human cancer. Many human cancers are aneuploid, with very high chromosome numbers, and over-express Mps1. Aneuploid breast tumor cells are especially dependent upon Mps1 ? presumably because of the demands placed upon the bi-orientation machinery by the high chromosome numbers in these cells. These results have led to the pursuit of anti-Mps1 compounds that might act as anti-tumor drugs. Determining the mechanism-of-action of Mps1 in bi-orientation would clarify the specific Mps1 protein interactions that might be the best targets for the development of refined anti-tumor therapeutics.  This project seeks determine the mechanisms used to form force-generating kinetochore-microtubule attachments in yeast meiosis, and the role of Mps1 in that process. The project has four Aims. The first will use imaging approaches to monitor the interactions between a centromere and a single microtubule, to pinpoint the step in developing kinetochore-microtubule attachments that is defective in mps1 mutants. A second Aim will explore the roles of known phosphorylation targets of Mps1 that reside at the kinetochore-microtubule interface, in the formation of productive kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This aim will be supported by a collaboration with investigators who will uncover new phosphorylation targets of Mps1 by mapping the Mps1 phospho-proteome. A third Aim is to characterize a collection of strains that carry suppressor mutations that improve chromosome segregation in mps1-R170S mutants ? these suppressor mutations likely map to genes that are involved in kinetochore-microtubule interactions and their analysis will shed light on how Mps1 is regulating this process. The final objective is to determine whether Mps1 contributes to mitotic chromosome segregation in the same way that it promotes proper chromosome segregation in meiosis. Because the proteins being examined in this proposal are for the most part shared between yeast and humans, the insights gained in the yeast system could have important implications for better understanding the origins aneuploidy and treatment of cancer in humans."

"9339571","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is a common, morbid and highly lethal disease of primarily older patients. While surgery and stent-grafting are highly effective in preventing death by rupture from larger AAA, they represent complex procedures with multiple potential complica-tions. Importantly, there are currently no therapeutic strategies that limit the growth of aneurysms, due in large part to a lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease and progression. In addition to tobacco use, genetic predilection, and male sex, the most important risk factor for AAA is advanced age. As such, it is not surprising that over 68,000 Veterans within the VHA suffer from AAA. After age 65 years, the prevalence of AAA increases by 6% per decade. To better understand this relationship, we examined a preclinical animal model of AAA in both young and aged male mice, and observed accelerated disease formation and enhanced interleukin-6(IL6)- based inflammatory signaling with aging. We also found that miR-24 is downregulated in murine AAA models, as well as human AAA tissue. Furthermore, microarray transcriptional profiling showed that a highly significant percentage of the putative targets of miR-24 were differentially and inversely upregulated during AAA development. Additionally we found that miR-24 is downregulated by IL6 in vascular smooth muscle and macrophages in vitro. We hypothesize aging enhances IL6 signaling, leading to downregulation of vascular miR-24. Reduced activity of miR-24, in turn, is permissive for a panel of downstream inflammatory genes that play a role in aging-accelerated AAA development. Therefore, enhancing miR-24 expression and activity within the aortic wall may have therapeutic benefit. To investigate this molecular cascade, we will use pharmacological and molecular methods to delineate the signaling events initiated by IL6 in vitro that result in decreased miR-24 levels (Specific Aim 1). Next, we will elucidate the effects manipulating miR-24 levels have upon inflammatory gene expression and cellular function (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will alter miR-24 levels in vivo to evaluate the effects upon age-accelerated AAA formation (Specific Aim 3). Completion of these specific aims will delineate a novel mechanism that may underlie age-related vascular inflammation and accelerated aneurysm formation and provide the basis for clinical translation."
"9407862","Abstract According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 8 women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer at some point in their life and 15-20% of these women will have triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks the three receptors (ER, PR, HER2) that current drug treatment targets (tamoxifen, Herceptin). Because of its aggressive nature and lack of effective treatment that specifically targets TNBC, it is responsible for 66% of all breast-cancer deaths. The only treatment options involve chemotherapeutics that destroy healthy tissue by targeting replicating cells. Being able to target TNBC tumors directly would reduce toxicity associated with these drugs and decrease mortality from TNBC, one of NeuLink?s long-term goals. Recently, folate receptor alpha (FRA) was found to be expressed on 80% of TNBC tissue with high expression correlating with poor prognosis, suggesting a target for treating TNBC. Preliminary data generated at Wayne State University demonstrates the binding of a novel FRA-binding molecule to FRA-expressing TNBC cells. Upon binding, this molecule is able to recruit and activate neutrophils (PMNs), the major white blood cell in humans, to destroy TNBC cells. These findings suggest the use of a molecule of this type could effectively kill breast tumor cells and thus represents a promising effective targeted therapeutic treatment for TNBC. The hypothesis for this Phase I STTR is that a novel FRA-binding molecule (NEU1) will stimulate PMNs, by binding to its Fc?R1 receptor, to specifically destroy TNBC cells. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine which of 3 NEU1 variants using 1 of 3 IgA Fc fragments will activate PMNs to kill > 50% of human TNBC cell subtypes and 2) Determine which NEU1 variants will decrease mean tumor volume by > 50% in Fc?R1-expressing xenograft models. In Aim 1, 3 NEU1 variants will be synthesized and their ability to activate PMNs to kill basal-like (BL) or mesenchymal-like (ML) subtypes of human TNBC cells (cell lines or clinical isolates) by FRA binding and cross-linking of Fc?R1 on PMN?s will be measured and compared. PMN-mediated ADCC will be tested in a 51Cr-release assay and confirmed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. For Aim 2, these NEU1 variants will be tested for ability to inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models using the highest NEU1-responding TNBC cells (within both BL and ML subtype as well as clinical isolates from Aim 1). Assessment of cancer cell viability/apoptosis (Ki-67, active caspase-3) and PMN activation (MPO, CD68, Ly6G) within tumors will be determined by IHC. NEU1 stability in serum and Fc?R1 specificity using isolated mouse PMNs will also be confirmed. There is a clear need in the market for drugs specifically targeting TNBC for which no therapy is approved. To successfully bring NEU1 to market as an orphan drug, NeuLink, together with their advisory board and small business consultants, will guide NEU1 from pre-clinical to clinical trials. NeuLink?s overall strategy after IND filing is to complete Phase I clinical trials and either 1) establish a strategic alliance with a pharmaceutical partner or 2) have NeuLink acquired."

For  the current submission, IPIM has been expanded to include preclinical imaging, optical cellular (confocal)  and electron microscopy. This expansion has been facilitated by an NCI CCSG supplemental grant  (3P30CA023108-32S4) that supported renovation of a new small animal imaging facility. Construction was  completed in 2012. The new Shared Resource is used by investigators from four of the six NCCC research  programs, including Cancer Mechanisms, Molecular Therapeutics, Cancer Imaging & Radiobiology, and  Immunology & Cancer Immunotherapy. IPIM combines animal and cell-based ionizing irradiation services,  sophisticated cell and electron microscopic imaging, and large and small animal imaging capabilities,  including 9.4T small-bore magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI), small bore/rodent  positron emission tomography (mPET), small bore / rodent computed tomography (mCT), high resolution x-  vivo small bore CT, whole animal (rodent) bioluminescent (IVUS) and fluorescence (Infrared) imaging.  Additionally, IPIM oversees large-animal imaging instrumentation, including MRI, CT,  fluoroscopy/angiography, and ultrasound; all necessary for many types of preclinical translational research.  IPIM is involved intimately in the development and use of the recently completed Center for Surgical  Innovation (CSI), a unique novel intraoperative clinical and preclinical surgery-imaging facility that includes  state-of-the-art MRI and CT scanners that enable scanning a patient during surgical procedures. Finally the  IPIM (Strawbridge, Hoopes) oversees and facilitates several alternating magnetic field (AMF) generators  and coils currently used to activate magnetic nanoparticles in the ongoing NCCC nanotechnology cancer  research program. IPIM activities are overseen by P. Jack Hoopes (DVM, PhD) and a senior internal  advisory board with very significant knowledge and experience in all scientific aspects of these services.  Activities are scheduled and managed by a centralized staff of seven highly experienced and trained  scientists and resource managers.

"9225885","Overdoses from opioid pain relievers (OPR) have reached epidemic proportions in the United States. In response to this public health crisis, there have been local, state and national efforts to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing. Recent small reductions in OPR deaths rates in 2012-3 suggest that these efforts may have been effective. However, unprecedented recent increases in heroin use, heroin use disorders, and heroin overdoses have also been observed. It has been suggested that efforts to curb inappropriate OPR prescribing are having the unintended consequence of increasing heroin use and its adverse events. Low cost and wide availability are common reasons provided for the switch from OPR to heroin use. To effectively manage the risk of heroin initiation, health systems, insurance plans, and medical providers need to understand whether, how, and for whom these risks are affected by OPR prescribing practices. Several policies in Colorado have been directed at curbing opioid prescribing. In August of 2014, Colorado Medicaid limited monthly quantities of short-acting opioid pills to 120. In February 2016, Medicaid limited the average daily covered morphine equivalent dose (MED) to 300 MED. Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) follows Medicaid's lead on opioid policy. These policies were intended to encourage providers to taper patients from high-dose opioid therapy, thus reducing the risk of OPR overdose. To date, however, the effect of these policies on physician prescribing behavior, OPR overdose, heroin use, and heroin overdose is not known. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a large, longitudinal cohort study to examine the impact of OPR policies and prescribing practices on heroin use and heroin overdose from 2012 to 2017. The study will include patients from a large managed care organization (Kaiser Permanente Colorado) and Colorado's Medicaid program. Together these systems cover approximately 2 million people in Colorado, representing 40% of the state's population. Exposures and outcomes, and covariates will be measured by linking patient-level data from pharmacy records, diagnoses, toxicology findings, health care utilization, and state vital records. Exposures and outcomes will be validated with medical record review. Analyses will be conducted with linear and nonlinear mixed effects regression models, with propensity scores to account for confounding. The results of these analyses will have implications for OPR prescribing policies at the state and national level."

"9127251","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term scientific goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that specify retina cell number. Using the compound eye of Drosophila as an experimental model, my laboratory has discovered the Hippo pathway as a central mechanism underlying this process. The core of the Hippo pathway comprises a kinase cascade in which the Ste20 kinase Hippo (Hpo) phosphorylates and activates the NDR family kinase Warts (Wts). Wts, in turn, phosphorylates and inactivates the oncoprotein Yorkie (Yki) by excluding it from the nucleus, where it normally functions as a coactivator for the DNA-binding transcription factor Scalloped (Sd). Our research further established a critical role for the Hippo pathway in controlling organ size in mammals, underscoring the importance of Drosophila as a powerful model to discover universal developmental mechanisms. Much of our recent efforts have focused on discovering the missing components of the Hippo pathway, with the ultimate goal of defining a complete Hippo signaling network that relays information from the extracellular milieu to nuclear gene transcription. We have made significant progress in the last grant period, including 1) the discovery of Crumbs as an apically localized transmembrane protein that regulates Hippo signaling by directly binding and localizing the tumor suppressor Expanded to apical membranes; 2) discovery of a functionally conserved Hippo pathway in organisms representing unicellular relatives of Metazoa; 3) discovery of verteporfin as the first small molecule inhibitor for Yki and its mammalian homologue YAP; 4) discovery of default repression as a fundamental mechanism underlying Hippo-mediated growth regulation by demonstrating that Sd functions by default as a transcriptional repressor; 5) elucidating the molecular mechanism by which Merlin regulates Hippo signaling by demonstrating a requirement for Merlin in direct binding and recruitment of the effector kinase Wts to the plasma membrane. In the coming project period, we will further elucidate the composition and regulation of the Hippo pathway through the following aims. First, we have identified, through biochemical screens, another protein kinase that can phosphorylate and activate Wts in a similar manner as Hpo. Our goal in this aim is to characterize the role of this Hpo-like kinase in growth control and Hippo signaling in vivo. Second, we have identified, through phenotype-based screens, a novel tumor suppressor that regulates Hippo signaling in a non-cell autonomous manner as well as a tumor suppressor complex that regulates Hippo signaling in a cell-autonomous manner. Our goal in this aim is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which these novel tumor suppressors regulate the Hippo pathway. Lastly, we have designed a sensitized genetic screen to identify additional components of the Hippo pathway. Our goal in this aim is to complete the genetic screen and to molecularly characterize candidate genes identified from the screen. Besides revealing fundamental mechanisms of eye development, the proposed studies will have general implications for the development of other tissues."
"9220726","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among children; it is related to multiple diseases and increases the risk of hospitalization. Effective interventions exist for smoking cessation. In addition to the need for effective cessation interventions, there is an important role for counseling on exposure reduction, especially as evidence suggests that families with home smoking bans are more likely to quit smoking over time. Several studies have studied effective ways to provide cessation and exposure reduction counseling to parents of children in the outpatient setting and for adult inpatient smokers, including the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke (CEASE) project. The inpatient stay presents different challenges and opportunities from outpatient practice in the treatment of children's smoke exposure. The hospitalization of a child may present a teachable moment for parents who smoke. Several small studies of parents of hospitalized children have found modest success with inpatient interventions involving counseling, and QuitLine referral or nicotine replacement therapy. Our intervention uses the evidence-based US Public Health Service Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence guidelines coupled with the best evidence specific to using the child's inpatient stay to help parents quit smoking and reduce their children's exposure. We will use the RE-AIM framework to evaluate and maximize our institution's readiness to change, as well as intervention implementation and maintenance. We are proposing a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of our intervention bundle. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1) To assess the efficacy of the intervention in increasing parent report of having smoke-free homes and cars 6 months after hospitalization; Aim 2) To demonstrate whether children whose parents receive the intervention bundle have greater decreases in cotinine levels 6 months post-hospitalization; Aim 3) To assess the efficacy of the intervention in increasing parent quit rates  months after hospitalization; Aim 4) To use implementation process measures from the RE-AIM framework to assess the extent that our intervention results in hospital-wide systems change, including automatic screening for tobacco smoke exposure and delivery of tobacco control services. To achieve these aims, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial of our intervention bundle, which is evidence-based, effective in outpatient settings, and pilot-tested within our institution. We will follow both the control and intervention groups for 6 months, and use biological markers of exposure to assess exposure reduction and parent cessation. Understanding whether traditional smoking cessation interventions can help parents of hospitalized children will give inpatient providers an effective toolkit for providing a comprehensive intervention for tobacco cessation and exposure reduction."
"9464351","Our goal is to develop a first -in-class therapeutic agent that directly blocks the metabolism of fructose, a key component in sugar. Intake of sugar (sucrose) and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) induces metabolic syndrome and diabetes in laboratory animals and are strongly associated with obesity and diabetes in humans. Both sucrose and HFCS contain fructose, which stimulates food intake by inducing leptin resistance while lowering metabolism, including blocking fatty-acid oxidation. We found that these effects of fructose were mediated by the unique ability of fructose to decrease intracellular-ATP levels during its metabolism, which is due to the rapid consumption of ATP by the enzyme fructokinase C (KHK-C) in the liver. Mice lacking KHK-C are protected from sugar-induced obesity, fatty liver, and metabolic syndrome. While sugar and HFCS are major sources of dietary fructose, we found that fructose can be endogenously produced by high glycemic or high salt diets and that blocking fructokinase protects animals from obesity and insulin resistance from this source of fructose. Furthermore, mice lacking fructokinase are also protected from the orphan disease, hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). Blocking KHK-C is safe, as humans lacking have a normal life span and mice lacking KHK-C are even protected from aging-associated kidney disease. In Phase I of our STTR, our goal was to develop two novel lead compounds with IC50 values in the submicromolar range that were effective at blocking KHK-C both in vitro and in vivo and with specificity for KHK compared to other sugar kinases. While much of our initial effort was aimed at developing derivatives of a nutraceutical (osthol) as novel chemical entities, we were unable to break the submicromolar-IC50 target. However, more recently a series of novel indazole compounds has been identified, which have high potency and selectivity, and have robust in vivo activity after oral administration. In this Phase II proposal, we plan to optimize our lead inhibitors using structure-based drug design (SBDD). Aim 1 is to optimize our lead inhibitors with increased potency (IC50 <40 nM) and selectivity guided by SBDD. In Aim 2, the most promising lead compounds will be evaluated in in vitro ADME assays (e.g. solubility, permeability, microsomal stability) and in vitro toxicity (e.g. CYP450 inhibition, Ames test and hERG inhibition. Inhibitors of high interest will undergo in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling and exploratory toxicity testing. Aim 3 is to test these lead compounds in our unique animal disease models for long-term efficacy at blocking fructose-induced fatty liver, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome, as well the protection of mice with HFI (due to knockout of the aldolase B gene) towards fructose. Inhibitors with robust efficacy will also be evaluated in exploratory toxicology studies. Completion of these studies should result in an optimal preclinical development candidate for a first-in- class drug for those suffering from HFI and metabolic syndrome."
"9329411","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year plan for Li Qiang to transition to an independently-funded investigator, applying rigorous scientific method to metabolic research. Dr. Qiang received PhD degree from Boston University School of Medicine in 2007 and performed postdoctoral training in Diabetes Research Center (DRC) and Department of Medicine at Columbia University since 2008. Dr. Qiang's training cemented his intent to uncover the browning mechanism of white adipose tissue (WAT) through Ppar? deacetylation, and further lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic agent to treat metabolic syndrome. The goals of the proposed training are to provide training and mentoring to prepare Dr. Qiang for an independent research career, and additionally, to answer fundamental questions that persist in obesity research and how it goes awry in diabetic patients. Obesity leads to insulin resistance and further Type 2 diabetes. Currently available insulin sensitizer thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are at skepticism for their detrimental effects. Recently browning of WAT has been appreciated for its metabolic improvement. A mechanistic understanding of the browning function of TZD is necessary to develop new anti-diabetic drugs that are shorn of the side effects. In this application, Dr. Qiang describes preliminary data that reveal the novel role f acetylation in regulating the transcriptional selectivity of Ppar?. Dr. Qiang and one of his mentors, Domenico Accili, determined that SirT1 gain-of-function mimics TZD in browning WAT. These effects were recapitulated by the deacetylation-mimetic Ppar?-2KR mutant in vitro. Dr. Qiang proposes in this application (1) to characterize the physiological significance of Ppar? deacetylation, (2a) to determine the mechanism by which Ppar? deacetylation converts energy-storing WAT into energy-dissipating BAT-like tissue, and (2b) to study the interplay between acetylation and other post-translational modifications (PTMs) in regulating Ppar?'s transcriptional selectivity and metabolic functions. The results gained from these proposed studies should yield important insights into whether reprogramming white adipose tissue into an energy-dispersal site will provide new treatment options for human obesity and diabetes, and whether it is possible to develop a new class of Ppar? ligands that displays TZD's beneficial metabolic effects but without its cardiovascular, oncogenic, and bone loss comorbidities. Dr. Qiang's long-term career objective is to understand the mechanisms of brown remodeling WAT through PTMs of Ppar?, and further translate the seminal discoveries made at the bench into therapeutic treatments for obesity and diabetes. The scientific knowledge that required to integrate browning WAT at both molecular level and physiological level, as well as in the many complicated and technical aspects of Ppar? PTMs and SirT1 biology, can best be addressed through his choice of mentors (Drs. Domenico Accili and Wei Gu) and collaborators (Drs. Ira Goldberg and Yingming Zhao), all respected investigators who value mentoring young and aspiring faculty members. Finally, the Columbia University Medical Center environment brings together access to a diverse metabolic research groups and all the facilities and faculty developmental tools that Dr. Qiang will need in order to become an independent investigator and a productive member of the academic metabolism community."
"9404829","Blood biopsy test for pan-cancer mutations with error-checking probes Confidential PI: Shafer, David A., PhD PROJECT SUMMARY GeneTAG Technology (www.genetagtech.com) has developed a series of molecular diagnostic assays for cancer and infectious diseases based on DNA amplification and proprietary detection methods. Our primary system, internal DDS (iDDS) probes, comprises two interacting components, a fluor-labeled probe and a quencher-labeled antiprobe nearly complementary to the probe. In the absence of the intended target, paired probes and antiprobes bind together, quenching fluorescence and preventing off-target detection. This unique system provides highly specific single-base discrimination over a wide temperature range (10?30C). Recently, we merged iDDS probe technology with Wild Terminator (WTx) methods to enable detection of low-abundance mutants by blocking amplification of the wild-type sequence (patent pending). By combined these technologies, we can reliably detect single-base variants of numerous targets at trace levels (0.01%) in a background of wild type genomic DNA. This enhanced qPCR sensitivity meets or exceeds the sensitivity of specialized platforms (such as droplet digital PCR, next-generation sequencing [NGS], and MALDI-TOF), which have been used to study rare mutations in the plasma of cancer patients. Our primary goal is to develop a pan-cancer screening test based on this combined method. This new method should enable the detection of low frequency diagnostic driver mutations in the blood that derive from a somatic tumor located elsewhere in the body. Our probes can reliably detect specific mutations that are indicative of a particular cancer or of a drug resistant variant. By covering ten or more of the common cancer-specific mutations in one assay we can identify the presence of an unknown cancer at an early stage, and in some cases, we can pin-point which cancer is likely. The Specific Aims of this Phase I grant are: 1, to test and compare selective-amplification methods for detecting low- abundance, pan-cancer driver mutations and 2, to develop and test a prototype assay for pan-cancer driver mutations in plasma based on iDDS probes and selective amplification. To demonstrate feasibility, we will study pan-cancer mutations in plasma samples from early- and late-stage patients with cancers that show high levels of ctDNA, such as neuroblastoma, prostate, ovarian, colorectal, hepatocellular, and breast cancer. Our long-range goal by the end of Phase II is to market a generalized test for ~100 circulating cancer biomarkers (actionable and drug-resistant variants), based on a synthesis between WTx, iDDS, NGS, and statistical methods. Such information would guide physicians in follow-up testing and selecting appropriate first-line targeted therapy. This, in turn, would provide a public health benefit by enabling early cancer detection through a non-invasive approach."
"9268458","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The aging US population threatens to overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, especially since the rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone is expected to triple in the coming decades. This problem is compounded in the VA Healthcare System, where over 40 percent of veterans are age 65 or older compared to 13 percent within the general population. Memory deficits are characteristic of AD and cause functional impairment, reduced quality of life, increased caregiver burnout, and eventual institutionalization. The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) identifies those with memory deficits but who remain relatively independent in everyday life. Because these patients are at substantially increased risk of converting to AD, MCI provides a window within which interventions could maximize memory functioning and prolong independence. The proposed study focuses specifically on a groundbreaking combination of mnemonic strategy training and non- invasive brain stimulation.  Mnemonic strategies are cognitive tools that help patients work around memory deficits. Our preliminary data suggest that mnemonic strategies are effective for improving memory but that (1) not all patients benefit from training and (2) patients have difficulty generalizing them to new information. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in these earlier studies to identify the neural correlates of strategy use, which suggest that the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is one such vital region. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that is used to enhance neuroplasticity and improve the efficacy of behavioral training techniques (e.g., motor rehabilitation after stroke). Thus, the central premise of the proposed study is that tDCS can enhance functioning in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, thereby inducing adaptive neuroplastic change and increasing the efficacy of mnemonic strategy training in patients with MCI.  In this randomized, double-blind study, participants will complete 5 consecutive treatment sessions in which they receive either active or sham tDCS over the targeted brain region in combination with mnemonic strategy training. Patients will undergo both laboratory-based and real-world memory testing to examine strategy generalization as well as fMRI scanning before and after training. Persistence of memory test and fMRI improvements will be examined at a 3-month follow-up. The use of fMRI will provide critical information about the mechanisms of action, especially whether the targeted brain region (vlPFC) does, in fact, mediate behavioral improvement.  It is expected that, relative to the sham group, the active tDCS group will demonstrate persistent improvement in ecologically-based measures of memory as well as increased activation within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. We will also examine the relationship between increased brain activation and generalized effects on other cognitive processes mediated by the targeted brain region. This first-of-its-kind study has the potential to meaningfully translate more basic science findings into neuroanatomically targeted and functionally meaningful treatments for our aging population."
"9538366","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research."
"9449731","PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare-associated (HA) Staphylococcus aureus infections are declining but remain common. Conversely, rates of community-associated infections have not decreased due to the inadequacy of mechanisms to control transmission in a community setting. Hispanic Americans have a lower risk of infection than non-Hispanic whites, while American Indians face an increased risk for infections. The underlying causes of this disparity are unknown. Our long term objective is to use risk-based information founded upon empirical evidence of transmission to inform intervention strategies that reduce S. aureus transmission in the community. Our immediate goals are to determine whether national trends are reflected within different ethnic groups in Yuma, Arizona vis  vis infection rates and asymptomatic carriage. We will also determine if clinical strains are representative of community-carriage strains and not due to the emergence of a few, highly fit lineages. Given the broad differences in social interactions due to travel and residency patterns among ethnic groups, we also aim to determine the role that social relationships and interactions have on S. aureus transmission, either as risk or protective factors. The rationale is that we will gain an understanding of underlying causes of this health disparity and gain further insights into important components of S. aureus transmission: community carriage, pathogen genotypes, and the impact of social interactions.  Specific Aim #1. We will characterize S. aureus infection and carriage rates and compare circulating pathogen genotypes with those associated with disease isolated from local clinical specimens across full- and part-time resident groups, and across Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White ethnic groups. Whole genomes from community sampling will be phylogenetically compared to those from clinical samples to determine if the diversity of clinical pathogen genotypes is representative of community genotypes. We expect to find evidence that pathogen populations do not differ among these groups, suggesting that pathogen genotypes do not explain ethnic based disparities in S. aureus infections.  Specific Aim #2. We will determine and test social network- and social determinants-based risk factors for transmission of S. aureus. While enrolling participants, we will collect data that will define local social ?contact? groups. We will use social determinants of health and social network variables (both ego- centric and relational) to determine the extent to which social relationships can contribute to understanding S. aureus transmission by 1) asking participants questions designed to quantify physical contact within a social group, 2) characterizing their nasal, pharyngeal, and hand microbiome as independent estimators of contact and social proximity resulting in transmission of commensal species, 3) and by comparing the evolutionary relatedness of S. aureus positive samples with the measured or estimated level of contact among participants. !"
"9483496","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT We propose an innovative Transdisciplinary Research, Equity and Engagement Center for Advancing Behavioral Health (TREE Center). We propose to expand on and leverage the knowledge, research capacities and cross-sectoral collaborations established by the former NM CARES Health Disparities Center (P20 MD004811, R. Williams, PI). We will use these strengths to specifically target improvement of behavioral health disparities for socioeconomically disadvantaged and underserved rural populations with a southwest regional focus on American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and Latinos in New Mexico. Our goal is to highlight the social determinants of behavioral health, including Adverse Childhood Experiences, historical trauma, and intersectional effects of poverty and discrimination to improve conditions and outcomes related to youth suicide, alcohol and drug misuse, depression, and access to behavioral health services. The four aims of the TREE Center are to: 1. Implement a co-leadership model in order to promote transdisciplinary, multi-level intervention research that will advance the knowledge and science to improve behavioral health outcomes; 2. Operationalize collaborative integration of theories, study design, and analysis into multi-level interventions that improve behavioral health outcomes due to an the interplay of biological, behavioral, physical environment, health care system, economic, and political forces in our representative rural, AI/AN, Latino and other partner communities; 3. Expand the development of a diverse scientific workforce by training new and early stage under-represented minority investigators in a transdisciplinary context, to conduct community engaged, multi- level intervention behavioral health research; and 4. Cultivate equitable collaborations with community and tribal stakeholders regionally and nationally in order to translate and co-disseminate transdisciplinary research evidence into practice and policy. The combined human, intellectual and relational resources and institutional commitments of Tree Center office space, travel funding for engaging with the Community Scientific Advisory Committee and dedicated mentoring of senior faculty will strengthen our impact in training the next generation of under-represented minorities and advancing the behavioral health of diverse populations in the southwest."
"9442536","PROJECT SUMMARY Analysis of structure and dynamics of membrane proteins is extremely challenging due to presence of the phase-separation boundary?a phospholipid membrane. Yet, association with lipid bilayer is critical for these proteins to function in transport, signal transduction, biosynthesis, and other cellular processes. Membrane proteins that catalyze electron transport are even more difficult to study because they often include multiple chromophores and fluorophores hindering spectroscopic interrogation. In this project, we are developing a powerful application of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and transient absorption (TA) spectroscopies to enable analysis of such chromophore-rich redox systems. Our case study is the cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) that supplies electrons to the cytochromes P450 localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of liver cells and other tissues. The presence of a phospholipid membrane is strictly required for a productive interaction of P450 with POR, which needs to assume an open conformation to allow for P450 binding. According to literature reports and our own experiments, the isolated soluble cytosolic fragment of POR is auto-inhibited and adopts a predominantly closed state in solution leading to negligible interaction with P450. We hypothesize that membrane binding triggers an open conformation of POR and relieves its auto-inhibition. This open state is further stabilized by binding of the cytochrome P450. We propose to test this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the preferential conformational state of oxidized and reduced membrane-bound POR; and (2) Create a structural model of membrane-bound POR in reduced and oxidized states in the presence and absence of cytochrome P450. In Aim 1, we will measure the distances between specific sites in POR using FRET with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy?a method we recently introduced. We expect to determine the distribution of the donor-acceptor distances in a series of POR samples, which will test our hypothesis that the open-closed equilibrium of membrane-bound POR shifts upon reduction and interaction with P450 to a more open population. In Aim 2, we will establish the relative orientation of the cytosolic domain of POR near the membrane through mapping its contacts with the membrane surface. The membrane contacts will be detected paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) of methyl-TROSY signals from POR. The membrane contacts information combined with data on the open-closed transition will be used as structural restraints to create a molecular model of POR-nanodisc and POR- nanodisc-P450 complexes which will be further refined with molecular dynamics. This work is significant because we aim to obtain the first structural model of membrane-bound POR to help formulate testable hypotheses on the role of specific mutations in the POR function. The second significant implication is development of the innovative approach based on a combination of the TA and NMR spectroscopies, which will be widely useful for structural analysis of flexible chromophore-rich membrane proteins."
"9428087","Project Summary-Abstract The application of high-throughput technologies in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research has become widespread and requires specialized skills to effectively design experiments, analyze large datasets and integrate new data with existing large datasets to solve complex problems in these fields. Students in STEM majors will need to acquire these skills in order to be effective in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workplace. Our proposed Bioinformatics ?Train the Trainer? (T3) Project will promote and support training in bioinformatics skills for college and university undergraduate science instructors so that they can effectively integrate bioinformatics into their science curricula and help their students be prepared for the 21st century workplace. The project has three innovative components. The first component is a 7-day short course for undergraduate instructors with hands-on activities for instilling competence and confidence in bioinformatics. The course will have both wet-bench laboratory and bioinformatics experiences, the combination of which, we believe, is key to fully understanding the biology underlying genome structures and the relationship between those structures and evolution, inheritance, disease, and human health. The second is a dedicated website with links to resources, bioinformatics tools, project archives, case studies, and a forum for building a Community of Bioinformatics Trainers so course participants can share post-course experiences, exchange ideas, and provide peer-to-peer mentoring. The third component of the project is a rigorous evaluation plan that will provide project leaders with feedback on the course, identify challenges and successes with bioinformatics integration into undergraduate curriculum, and determine the effectiveness of the project in terms of STEM retention and STEM career aspirations for undergraduates."
"9381909","Project Abstract  The overall goal of the lab is to study the role of energy homeostasis pathways in human disease using structural and chemical tools. Our lab focuses on two major fundamental pathways: O-GlcNAcylation and autophagy. The first major focus on the lab is on glycosylation, which plays a fundamental role in living organisms and is misregulated in several human diseases. A unique form of glycosylation in mammals involves the essential enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which dynamically transfers a single sugar on to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins to modulate signaling, transcription, and protein degradation. This single enzyme is responsible for glycosylating over a thousand substrates. Aberrant OGT activity is associated with human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, and neurodegeneration. However, the biology of this modification is quite complex because of the abundance of substrates for a single enzyme. This complexity has prevented an understanding of which substrates are important for human diseases, how OGT recognizes them, and how metabolic changes alter the physiology of cells through this enzyme. We seek to better understand the mechanism of this fundamental enzyme through a combination of biochemistry, structural biology, and chemical biology. Our major goal is to clarify the complex role that nuclear and cytoplasmic protein glycosylation has in human disease.  Autophagy is a conserved pathway that eukaryotic cells use to recycle materials from proteins to whole organelles for energy and quality control. It has recently been shown that cancer cells rely on autophagy to satisfy their increased energy demands and to resist chemotherapy. To study autophagy, our major goals are developing new chemical inhibitors of a key enzyme that initiates autophagy called ULK1. Our other goal is to find novel synthetic lethal interactors with autophagy by discovering other drugs that synergistically target cells when autophagy is inhibited. Our vision is to develop advance screening systems to better mimic tumors and look for new combinations of treatment that rely on blocking autophagy."
"9413621","ABSTRACT  With the availability of high-dimensional data, the bottleneck in clinical research has shifted from a paucity of biologic data to a paucity of high quality phenotypic data. The promise of personalized medicine can only be realized if investigators can study the data of millions of subjects in an integrated dataset containing accurate phenotypes. Several challenges exist before we can realize this goal. First, robust methods are needed to integrate different types of data in large populations of patients, including electronic medical record (EMR) data, patient reported outcomes measures, and genotypic data, into high dimensional datasets. Second, novel approaches are needed to accurately and efficiently identify patients with specific phenotypes of interest. Addressing these challenges will allow us to translate the information from high-dimensional datasets to discoveries that can improve patient care. The overarching goal of the VERITY Bioinformatics Resource Core is to support the VERITY Research Community to apply state-of-the art bioinformatics methods to enhance clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases.  Powerful bioinformatics methods and tools now exist that can provide the infrastructure to standardize and organize complex data. Consequently, researchers can query across formerly disparate datasets to analyze and summarize data using new visualization techniques, removing many of the barriers for translational studies. While these platforms were initially designed for general population studies, we will harness these tools for rheumatic and MSK disease research. Drawing on experience using high dimensional data for research, the Core faculty and staff will provide support and guidance to the VERITY Research Community on the methods and tools to incorporate these approaches to advance clinical research studies through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To establish and customize a state-of-the-art bioinformatics platform to support rheumatic and MSK clinical data for sharing and collaborative research. Sub-aims include: to establish a published, open-source bioinformatics platform that standardizes and integrates diverse data types, and allows users to visualize and query the data in real time; and to forge partnerships between the rheumatic and MSK clinical research and bioinformatics communities through core consulting services. Aim 2. To provide and support a suite of bioinformatics tools with direct applications to clinical research studies.  In sum, the VERITY Bioinformatics Core will establish a state-of-the-art bioinformatics platform for rheumatic and MSK disease clinical research, applying principles of open-source code and data visualization. The Core will extend our current work to the Research Community working in different locations on a wide range of NIAMS-mission driven conditions. Moreover, the research questions arising from VERITY will present new methodologic challenges, driving advancement of bioinformatics methods and fostering new collaborations."
"9463977","PROJECT SUMMARY Our long-term goal is to understand the function of nerves within bone, how changes to skeletal innervation with disease impact bone pathophysiology, and whether bioelectric stimulation can be used to promote skeletal health and bone accrual. Despite decades of research, there is only one clinical anabolic therapy to treat patients with bone loss and elevated fracture risk - and its use is limited to a total of only 2-years during a patient?s lifetime. Bioelectric stimulation of nerve outflow to skeletal tissues represents a novel, untapped option with significant clinical potential. Current literature supports a paradigm by which sensory neurotransmitters are anabolic, promoting bone formation, while the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine induces bone loss. Thus, selective activation of sensory nerve depolarization and release of efferent neurotransmitters may promote bone formation and contribute to decreased skeletal fragility in high- risk populations. A substantial barrier to taking such a targeted approach is our limited understanding of nerve distribution and function within the bone and bone marrow. To overcome this, the work in this proposal will establish critical fundamental insights into three key aspects of skeletal neurobiology. In Aim 1, we will define the connection and overlap of multiple, diverse skeletal regions across the central neuroaxis, including sub- classification of traced first-order sensory neurons in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. In Aim 2, we will quantify the distribution and density of sensory and sympathetic nerves within the bone and bone marrow, and its variability across skeletal sites in mice and humans. This analysis will be paired with characterization of functional secondary architecture including the presence of Schwann cells around skeletal axons and terminal target relations with bone-forming osteoblasts, bone-resorbing osteoclasts, and hematopoietic cells. In Aim 3, we will directly examine the impact of bioelectric stimulation on bone and bone marrow including acute changes in soluble signaling factors and chronic regulation of skeletal health and integrity. The fundamental knowledge developed from the work in this proposal will provide essential information about the distribution and function of skeletal nerves to the SPARC consortium and inform future targeted approaches for bioelectric stimulation of skeletal health and regeneration."
"9468971","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce oral health disparities in rural school children.  Our immediate goal is to test two new evidence-based, school-based, cavity prevention programs.  We will compare two preventions: (1) A newer, simpler, less expensive, efficient treatment using fluoride varnish + silver diamine fluoride; and (2) A more traditional, complex, expensive, time-intensive treatment that includes simple + sealants + interim therapeutic restorations. The simpler method takes 6 minutes to deliver, compared to the more complex method that takes 20 minutes. Therefore, if the simpler, less expensive is as effective as the more complex, more expensive method, the data could support clinical and policy change.  To compare the two methods we will use a cluster randomized control trial design. We will implement this program in rural New Hampshire schools. All children in a school with informed consent will receive the same treatment (either simple or complex). We will provide preventive care twice per year for the 5 year grant period.  We will follow all children longitudinally for five years to determine the effectiveness of each preventive method. The primary outcome to make this determination will be the percentage of children with untreated decay. This is one of the U.S. Healthy People oral health goals. We will also examine the cost and cost- effectiveness. This will allow us to determine the balance between effectiveness and cost.  Assessing effectiveness and costs is particularly important for reducing disparities. If an intervention is quick, inexpensive, and 100% effective, that is a relatively simple choice. Most interventions are not 100% effective. Therefore, information on time, expense, and effectiveness will allow us to make better informed clinical and policy decisions. Specifically, this will help us answer the question: How much of which preventive intervention will increase access, improve health, and reduce costs?"
"9392825","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): If the healthcare community hopes to head off the impending cancer storm, we need to get more serious about cancer prevention soon. Unfortunately, less than 1.5% of total biomedical research funding is targeted to early detection and prevention of chronic disease. With respect to all human malignancies, 35% are linked directly to diet and an additional 14-20% to obesity. Consistent with these data, cancer risk can be lowered by 36% when humans adhere to healthy dietary principles. Establishing a causal role for cancer dietary chemoprevention approaches that are free of safety problems intrinsic to drugs administered over long periods of time would have a major translational impact in cancer prevention and patient survivorship. Therefore, our overall goal is to better understand the molecular (nuclear and plasma membrane targeted) mechanisms linking intestinal epithelial cell responses to diet-derived natural botanical products, and endogenous (gut microbial) modifiers of colon cancer risk. Our extensive experience in the dietary chemoprevention field has afforded us with a unique mechanistic perspective in this regard. We propose to pursue two novel research themes. Project 1 will assess the combined agonist and antagonistic role of Arylhydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) ligands as determinants in colon stem cell homeostasis and malignant transformation. Our studies to date indicate that AhR ligands have profound short-term effects on stemness, and may be beneficial in terms of malignant transformation. Project 2 is designed to determine whether by altering cell membrane liquid ordered nanoscale assemblies, and therefore protein spatial localization and signaling, that select amphiphilic dietary agents will reduce oncogenic K-Ras signaling leading to reduced tumorigenesis. This strategy is consistent with recent reports from our lab and others that select amphiphilic agents, through direct modulation of the biophysical properties of the plasma membrane, alter oncogenic K- Ras nanoclustering and suppress signal transduction."
"9444825","Abstract This project seeks to advance controlled drug delivery systems via the development of novel mechanically activated microcapsules (MAMCs) for therapeutic delivery in response to mechanical load. While previous strategies have established microcapsules with various triggered release mechanisms (e.g., pH, heat, osmotic swelling) for drug delivery, most require external actuation, and physiological feedback plays little role in release. This proposal takes the unique approach of using mechanically loaded environments (e.g., articulating joints) to trigger and control release of therapeutics. Upon rupture, bioactive molecules released from microcapsules (embedded within matrices), can stimulate anabolic processes leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, matrix biosynthesis, or a host of other responses including control of inflammation. Given that the timing of release is controlled by mechanical load, it is possible to tune the release of factors based on the mechano-sensitivity of the microcapsules. For example, these MAMCs may be used in conjunction with engineered tissues to foster regeneration under controlled loading during rehabilitation, or designed to actuate in response to normal walking and exercise, so as to promote rapid local repair. In Aim 1 we will investigate the structure-release properties of the MAMCs under physiologic loading scenarios by modifying key fabrication parameters, including polymer composition, shell thickness-to-radius ratio, and shell elasticity/plasticity. In Aim 2 we will characterize failure properties of MAMCs embedded in engineered matrices analogous to native tissue as a function of fabrication parameters, adhesion to local environment, and load. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the effect of therapeutic release from MAMCs embedded within engineered cartilage for the purpose of stimulating growth in response to physiologic loading and promoting repair in response to injurious loading. Finally, in Aim 4, we will assess the actuation of MAMCs in an in vivo load bearing animal model of cartilage repair. Collectively these Aims will test the hypothesis that physiologically relevant mechanical forces can temporally and spatially control the delivery of bioactive growth promoting molecules that positively impact tissue formation and repair. Completion of these Aims will culminate with validation of MAMCs in a clinically relevant animal model and support this as a novel drug delivery system with broad applications in directing regeneration and repair in mechanically loaded tissues.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), the most common human sarcoma, has been a model for molecular therapy because it is driven primarily by either a Kit or Pdgfr? mutation, and the small molecule inhibitor imatinib mesylate is effective against both associated oncoproteins. Previously, we have shown that part of the anti-tumor efficacy of imatinib depends on altering the intratumoral immune response to promote T cell immunity. Our goal is to optimize the use of immune therapy with molecular therapy to achieve better oncologic outcomes. Current therapy of advanced GIST relies entirely on tyrosine kinase inhibitors, since conventional chemotherapy is ineffective. While imatinib is efficacious, its effects are usually short-lived as acquired resistance develops, usually due to an additional mutation in Kit. Furthermore, some patients with GIST have primary resistance to imatinib, as their tumor never responds to treatment. Therefore, novel treatments are needed. We have discovered that the transcription factors estrogen receptor alpha and beta-catenin are critical to tumor cell survival in mouse and human GIST. In this proposal, we will investigate estrogen receptor alpha and beta-catenin inhibition in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST and combine it with immunotherapy to increase anti-tumor efficacy. We will utilize three genetically engineered mouse models of GIST, two of which contain imatinib-resistant Kit mutations. We will perform correlative immunologic studies on freshly procured human GIST surgical specimens. We expect that the results will advance our understanding of the biology of GIST and lead to novel clinical trials combining immune and molecular therapy. While we are focused on GIST, our findings will have relevance to other cancers treated with targeted therapy."

"9359226","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall objective of Project 4 is to discover and exploit extrinsic mechanisms of therapy resistance by focusing on the contribution of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our overarching hypothesis is that TAMs and TAFs cooperate in creating a favorable tumorigenic environment that ultimately leads to the emergence of therapeutic resistance and immune escape in NB. We also postulate that as tumors are treated, the TME is altered in its composition and function to become increasingly favorable to therapeutic resistance. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary data from our group demonstrating that TAMs and TAFs are abundantly present in an inflammatory subtype of NB at diagnosis associated with a high risk of recurrence and extremely poor prognosis. We also have evidence that TAMs and TAFs when exposed to tumor cells stimulate their proliferation, survival and drug-resistance via the paracrine production of pro-tumorigenic cytokines and chemokines that activate in tumor cells signaling pathways such as STAT3 and ERK. Our project has 3 aims. Aim 1, will examine mechanisms of cooperation between TAMs and TAFs, testing the hypothesis that in MYCN amplified tumors that do not produce the TAM chemoattractant CCL-2/MCP-1, TAFs are a source of this chemokine. We will also examine the contribution of cytokines and chemokines generated in co-culture of TAMs, TAFs and NB cells and the signaling pathways they activate in NB cells leading to increased proliferation and survival. Aim 2, will examine changes in the TME landscape secondary to chemotherapy in syngeneic murine NB models (with Project 2) and validate the data in patient tumor samples obtained via Core B. By examining changes in the transcriptome that occur in NB cells chronically exposed to TAM/TAF and their potential epigenetic origin (with Project 3), aim 2 will also identify vulnerabilities to prevent resistance to chemotherapy or targeted therapy (with Project 1). Aim 3, will then translate these discoveries in pre-clinical tumor models. We will test the therapeutic efficacy of the most promising agents targeting TAFs, TAMs, or pathways they activate in tumor cells in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy (with Project 5), using human NB lines and patient-derived xenotransplants in immunodeficient mice as well as murine cell lines in immunocompetent mice (with Project 2), The most effective agent(s) will then be proposed for early phase clinical trials to the NANT (Core B). Thus Project 4 brings a unique contribution to the overall objective of this PPG through its focus on the TME and on non-autonomous mechanisms leading towards therapeutic resistance and immune escape."
"9406430","Abstract ? Washington University's PrecISE Clinical Center  The overall impact of severe asthma on individuals affected by this disease as well as society is substantial. Treatment for severe asthma is now focusing on tailoring treatment to particular phenotypes driven by the endotypes yet the evidence for this approach is lacking. Key phenotypes which have supporting evidence for appropriate biomarkers and therapy based on their endotype include eosinophilic-, T2- and mucin-driven disease states. This proposal contains a precision-medicine, biomarker-driven, highly novel adaptive controlled trial to establish a new treatment paradigm for severe asthma as proposed by the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network RFA. In the current proposal, our overall hypothesis is that a specific phenotype (eosinophilic, T2 or mucin) will respond better to a biologic therapy targeted specifically to that phenotype than an empirical approach. Specifically, we hypothesize that patients with the following phenotypes will differ in treatment responses: i) eosinophilic - treatment with anti-IL5 or anti-IL4R? monoclonal antibody (mAb) is superior to anti-IgE, ii) T2 - treatment with anti-IL4R? or ?IL5 is superior to anti-IgE and iii) mucus - treatment with either anti-IL4R? or - IL5 is superior to anti-IgE. In this adaptive trial design, we will use two short-term response indicators, improvement in FEV1 of 100 ml or greater from baseline and/or improvement in asthma control (ACQ) score of 0.5 or greater, to determine if the patient is responding or not. The primary endpoint will be the asthma exacerbation rate. Accordingly, our specific aims are to study adolescent and adult patients with severe persistent exacerbation-prone asthma to: Aim I. Evaluate which biologic therapy, anti-IL4R?, anti-IL5 or anti-IgE mAb, is most effective among patients with eosinophilic asthma (blood eosinophil ?300 cells/L) who demonstrate a short term- response and which demonstrates an acceptable safety profile. Aim II. Evaluate which biologic therapy, anti-IL4R?, anti-IL5 or anti-IgE mAb, is most effective among patients with T2 asthma (high T2 sputum signature) who demonstrate a short term-response and which demonstrates an acceptable safety profile. Aim III. Evaluate which biologic therapy, anti-IL4R?, anti-IL5 or anti-IgE mAb, is most effective among patients with mucus-driven asthma (high mucus score on qCT chest) who demonstrate a short term- response and which demonstrates an acceptable safety profile. Aim IV. a. Determine whether airway remodeling (change in qCT wall area) is modified by biologic therapy. Aim IV. b. Evaluate the ability of a positive short-term response within each biologic therapy to predict exacerbations and airway remodeling."
"9447469","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall objective of the Tuskegee University Center for Biomedical Research/Research Centers in Minority Institutions (TU CBR/RCMI) Program is to build upon and develop the University?s research infrastructure and researchers to conduct research related to health disparities. This initiative is centered around: 1) providing the necessary infrastructure, resources, services, and technical support to enhance the ability of the University?s researchers to stay on the cutting-edge of multidisciplinary biomedical research focused on health disparities and 2) supporting the research and career development of junior- and mid-level investigators. These objectives are to be achieved primarily through the following aims: 1) Provide pilot-level funding to support the development and expansion of the biomedical research capacity of TU; 2) Provide core research facilities equipped with the infrastructure, instrumentation, and personnel to support the needs of the TU research community; 3) Engage the community through RCMI-sponsored activities that include the research faculty; and 4) Provide mentorship and career guidance to enhance the transition of junior-level investigators into independent scientists. The overall goal of the CBR/RCMI project (2017-2022) is to continue the development of its infrastructure and increase the numbers and skill proficiency of minority scientists engaged in advanced biomedical research focused on health disparities, including those for HIV, obesity, and prostate cancer, all of which disproportionately affect African Americans and underrepresented minorities. In other words, the goal is to continue support for a competitive, multidisciplinary collaborative environment that advances biomedical research. Tuskegee University has distinctive strengths because it is located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population, and it has a large number of minority faculty members as well as undergraduate and graduate trainees. The goal of the CBR/RCMI will be accomplished through establishment of three synergistic research cores, with services to enable investigative research on health inequities among minority groups, especially African-Americans residing in the ?Black Belt? counties of Alabama. These cores create a stimulating environment that promotes a culture of efficient and timely administrative support that will increase the number of funding submissions and/or acquisitions of extramural funding in biomedical and community engagement research. The Administrative Core will provide multi-functional support through pre- and post-award services; implementation of objectives, directions, and guidance; and oversight to ensure that specific aims and objectives are accomplished. Additionally, the Investigator Development Core will support the development of additional areas of research while enhancing the growth of junior faculty through senior mentorship and bioethics training. Further, through our community engagement core, we will establish relationships, build trust, and engage local communities and community-based organizations to learn from and to educate community members on health issues that affect them. We will also implement an evaluation plan to assess, over a period of five years, the progress, productivity, and accountability of the CBR by using both formative and summative outcomes. The outcome is to increase, by an approved and enforceable protocol that focuses on junior faculty development and productivity, the number of R-type grants awarded and the number of publications in peer- reviewed journals. The availability of advanced research equipment, coupled with the new knowledge generated by TU PhD students, scientists, and collaborators will contribute to the reduction of health disparities in the Black Belt counties of Alabama."
"9455432","This is a pre-clinical project to develop new methods that might translate to clinical brain stimulation for severe mental illness. We will test techniques for increasing the connectivity of two key brain areas: infralimbic cortex (IL) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). This circuit is related to fear and threat response. Increasing IL's influence over BLA may improve fear regulation, which in turn would be relevant for treating human anxiety, trauma, and mood disorders. We will manipulate IL-BLA connectivity with two methods: optogenetics, which is a powerful tool for studying circuits in animals, and electrical brain stimulation, which has promise as a treatment for severe mental illness. Optogenetic techniques are very specific, but difficult to translate to humans because of the viral manipulations and hardware involved. Our Hypothesis is that we can achieve specific connectivity changes from closed loop electrical stimulation ? monitoring IL and stimulating BLA when IL becomes active. That precise co-activation should evoke plasticity. Closed-loop stimulation has previously been developed for motor-circuit applications, and has successfully increased connectivity between brain, spinal cord, and muscle. We will now attempt to show that it can also be used in this IL-BLA fear circuit. To specifically demonstrate the advantage of the closed-loop approach, we will compare it against paired pulse stimulation. Paired pulse methods attempt the same kind of timing- dependent plasticity by stimulating two areas in quick succession, forcing them to be active together. Our Preliminary Data indicate that paired pulse techniques can increase IL-BLA connectivity. In Aim 1, we will optimize optogenetic and electrical parameters that increase IL-BLA connectivity during closed-loop stimulation. We will measure connectivity actively (by probing each area with electrical stimulation and seeing how the other responds) and passively (correlation of signals in the two areas during free behavior). We will directly compare optical and electrical stimulation, using a novel opto-electrode that allows us to test both techniques in the same animal. We expect to show that the two techniques produce similar results, and that both can substantially improve IL-BLA connectivity. We further expect to show that the closed-loop approach produces more connectivity change than the open loop paired pulse method. In Aim 2, we will use the same protocols to look for long-term effects that last hours to days. Long-lasting effects would be important both for clinical translation and for use of these stimulation methods in basic experiments. If successful, we will have shown that we can control an emotional circuit's connectivity with electrical stimulation, a finding with direct and near-term clinical relevance. The project PI is an interventional psychiatrist, and is prepared to take these findings forward into human use in future studies."

During the five-year U 5 4 project period, undergraduates at South Carolina State University (SCSU) and junior faculty at SCSU and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC-HCC) will be designated as South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) Scholars. Building from multiple ongoing efforts, the leaders of the SC CADRE are proposing a dual-level, integrated Research Education Core with an explicit focus on cancer health disparities. Expanded research education and training opportunities will be directed to both levels of Scholars. To realize the goal of the SC CADRE Research Education Core, the SCSU and MUSC-HCC Core Co-Leads plan to establish a new undergraduate SC CADRE Honors Program in Applied Oncology Sciences Research within the Department of Biological and Physical Sciences at SCSU to increase the pipeline of highly skilled, diverse undergraduates who pursue careers in biomedical research and cancer disparities. A new cancer research career development program at SCSU and MUSC-HCC will also be implemented for junior faculty who are interested in establishing independent careers in cancer disparities research. Within the Research Education Core, the SC CADRE undergraduate and junior faculty Scholars will interact as they participate in coursework and/or career development programming, weekly SC CADRE Research Club meetings, monthly seminar series, and an annual SC CADRE Cancer Health Equity Research Symposium. Through the Research Education Core, SCSU will hire two new junior faculty Scholars and MUSC-HCC will hire one new junior faculty Scholar, all of whom will be early-stage investigators (ESIs). Both levels of Scholars will actively engage in numerous SC CADRE enrichment activities and activities planned by the Community Outreach Core, which will work directly with Research Education Core leadership to s t r e s s the importance of community engagement in developing, conducting, and disseminating cancer disparities research."
"9419083","PLANNING AND EVALUATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY Detailed program planning and rigorous evaluation have been, and will continue to be, critical for the ongoing development of the research infrastructure supporting the U54 South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE).

The SC CADRE Program Steering Committee will be the primary external mechanism for annual review and advice on SC CADRE's progress in research, research education, and outreach and includes nationally recognized scientific and community leaders. An Internal Scientific Advisory Committee will convene quarterly and will include the Core Co-leads from specific SC CADRE components as well as the South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC) institutional leaders and officials. The composition of the Internal Scientific Advisory Committee will ensure the leveraging of resources and the congruence of priorities and goals across this inter-institutional partnership. Dr. William Whitaker, Jr. (SCSU) and Dr. Chanita Hughes-Halbert (MUSC-HCC) will Co-Lead this Core and provide oversight for the selection, review, and monitoring processes for the initial Full Research Project and the two Pilot Research Projects included in this application as well as future SC CADRE-supported research projects. Dr. Kathleen Cartmell (MUSC-HCC) will provide additional leadership by ensuring that the planning and evaluation logic model established by the SC CADRE leadership is implemented and documented at each level of SC CADRE. Collectively, these planning and evaluation components have been designed to accomplish the following aims: (1) assess SC CADRE's administrative and leadership effectiveness as well as the levels of inter-institutional and community engagement through science and dissemination activities; (2) track the progress of the research projects and core activities; (3) monitor the relationships between aims, activities, outputs, and expected outcomes; and (4) synthesize these evaluation activities to inform Center-wide strategic planning and priority setting that will in turn inform future directions for each SC CADRE component."
"9428752","ABSTRACT Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, the primary carrier of cholesterol within the brain, is an important determinant of an individual's risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the ?2 allele (ApoE2) appears to be protective, ApoE4 increases the risk for the disease. Growing evidence, including our findings within this application, argue that ApoE genotype affects the endosomal and exosomal pathways. In young ApoE2 mice, our preliminary studies have shown that neuronal early endosomes are reduced in size and number while a greater number of exosomes are seen in the brain extracellular space as compared to mice expressing the human ApoE3 allele, the neutral-risk allele in humans, or mice expressing the pathogenic ApoE4 allele, which leads to abnormally enlarged early endosomes and lower levels of exosomes in older mice. We propose that exosomes, secreted vesicles generated within endosomal compartments, help clear endosomal vesicular content from the endocytic pathway, thus contributing to the preservation of neuronal endosomal function during aging. Additionally, we hypothesize that the facile movement of cargo through the endocytic pathway in ApoE2 carriers contributes to efficient lysosomal function. This combination of endosomal and exosomal changes driven by ApoE2 suggests interrelated, and potentially additive, neuroprotective cellular processes. We propose to test our hypothesis that expression of the ApoE2 allele results in protective changes within the endosomal and exosomal pathways by examining humanized ApoE mouse brain at various ages as well as ApoE genotyped human brain tissue (Aim 1). In brain-derived endosomes and exosomes we will examine the lipidome and proteome and in exosomes, RNAs to identify molecular alterations that mediate protective ApoE2 endosomal and exosomal functions. To tie ApoE2 cell biology to brain function we focus on the olfactory system. Several recent studies, including both mouse and human data in part from our group, demonstrate that olfactory sensory physiology and perception may be especially sensitive biomarkers of ApoE genotype. For example, ApoE4 carriers have impaired odor identification (humans), impaired odor memory and olfactory system hyperexcitability (mice). In Aim 2, we will examine both olfactory sensory physiology and behavior to test the hypothesis that the ApoE2 isoform modulates olfactory function and can rescue ApoE4 deficits. Finally, in preliminary studies we have shown that a high fat/cholesterol diet causes neuronal endosomal pathway pathology in wild-type mice. In Aim 3, we will test our hypothesis that ApoE2-induced efficiencies in the endosomal and exosomal pathways protect from dietary lipid-induced endosomal pathway abnormalities. The overall objectives of our study are to characterize interconnected cellular pathways that we propose are protective in individuals expressing ApoE2 and to determine whether maintaining efficient endosomal and exosomal function through ApoE2 expression reduces neuronal vulnerability and cognitive deficits during aging, focusing in part on the highly informative olfactory system."
"9356790","Core 2: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics SUMMARY/ABSTRACT All projects in this Ovarian SPORE generate large amounts of data using a wide variety of assays, and are associated with clinical trials testing the efficacy of new therapeutic options. The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core 2) provides the quantitative expertise required to distill useful information from these various types of data, and to design and analyze the data from the clinical trials being run. Neither of these tasks is trivial. Assays now available (e.g., next-generation sequencing for mutation analysis, methylation arrays for epigenetic studies, expression arrays) are extremely powerful and can detect subtle changes that may be driving phenotypic changes, but this very sensitivity means they are also quite capable of detecting assay artifacts if proper experimental design (e.g., randomization) is not used. Further, the raw data generated requires substantial preprocessing before valid inferences can be drawn. Members of Core 2 have the training to address these tasks, which are common to the various projects?many of the same assays are being used with different experimental goals in mind, but the data analytic questions are parallel. Similarly, while all clinical trials have common goals (dose finding, treatment assessment), explicitly specifying what must be done to produce trials likely to provide the most information while putting the fewest patients at risk requires expertise in both the elicitation of relevant information and the ability to examine likely outcomes (often through simulation). Some common designs exist for the most frequent approaches pursued, but recent advances in the past few decades have allowed us to develop new strategies that may be better suited to the tasks at hand where the computing power now exists to explore how the operating characteristics are improved. Providing optimal support for the projects also requires the flexibility to address new challenges and opportunities that may arise. In this iteration of the SPORE, some of these challenges and opportunities include trying to optimally exploit both (a) data uniquely available within MD Anderson, where coupling of laparoscopic examination and biopsies with surgical evaluation lets us acquire both pre- and post-treatment samples from the population of interest, and (b) the wealth of public profiling data (e.g. TCGA ovarian assays) which can help winnow real phenomena from chaff. Core 2 has this flexibility, and is working with SPORE investigators on these tasks even now. Further, as the studies being pursued in the SPORE show, the separation between complex assays and clinical trials is becoming increasingly blurred. Moving forward will require clear thinking about what types of inferences can be reliably used, and how. Members of Core 2 are widely recognized for their contributions to this debate, which enables them to better support the SPORE."
"9540125","Breast cancer is a major global health issue; it is the second most common form of cancer in women exceeded only by lung cancer. Current breast cancer treatments are regulated by cell surface presentation; for example, breast cancer cells that express estrogen receptor-? (ER?) and human epidermal growth receptor-2 (HER2) on their surface are treated with hormone (anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitors) or targeted (Herceptin) therapies, respectively. In this proposal, we propose a personalized approach to treat four metastatic breast cancer populations: black, white, over 40 and under 40. These populations were chosen based on statistical differences in survival and rate of diagnoses. I will characterize the surface density and proximity of two Gprotein coupled receptors that facilitate tumor chemotaxis, CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and CC chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7). CXCR4 and CCR7 induce directional migration of tumor cells along chemokine gradients in a manner similar to lymphocyte homing. In addition, lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) has been shown to induce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). I propose to synthesize complementary engineered liposomes (CELs) that cooperatively bind CXCR4 and CCR7 and deliver short interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown Lcn2. Homogeneous and biphasic CELs are designed to complement the relative surface density and organization of receptors on breast cancer cells by allowing conjugated antibodies to rearrange on the surface or clustering antibodies within gel-phase lipid domains. CEL therapies will be designed to enhance cooperative binding to each cell type and be evaluated to reduce cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic studies will complement in vitro studies; the expression of RhoA, Rac1, Erk1, PI3K, E-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin will assess the effect of CEL therapy on cell migration, activation, survival, and the EMT. In vivo tumor progression and metastasis will be evaluated after delivery of CEL therapies. This work will demonstrate similarities and differences between 6 different breast cancer cell lines and deliver a platform technology designed specifically to address tumor metastasis. In comparison to the antibody and the antagonist targeted towards CXCR4 in clinical trials, this method has the advantage of localizing within tumors, cooperatively binding multiple chemokine receptors, blocking chemotaxis, delivering Lcn2 siRNA to impede the EMT, and monitoring biodistribution in vivo via the incorporation of a near infrared chromophore. My previous work, targeting cytokine-activated endothelial cells, presents compounding evidence that vehicles that complement the cell surface enhance binding. I propose to use our knowledge and experience in chemical engineering, material science, and nanotechnology to develop therapeutics that will increase breast cancer patient survival by inhibiting tumor progression and metastasis."
"9275506","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impaired glucose metabolism (gestational diabetes (GDM) and mild hyperglycemia) that occurs during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for pregnancy complications and is also an early indication of long- term metabolic dysfunction leading to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In the US, GDM is commonly diagnosed using a two-step screening and diagnostic approach. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) proposed a one-step diagnostic approach that broadens the definition of GDM by lowering the cutoff values to include women with milder forms of hyperglycemia, who would have screened normal under the current two-step approach. The goal of these recommendations is better identification of women at risk for pregnancy complications and long-term metabolic dysfunction, but it results in a significant increase in the prevalence of GDM. The NIH Gestational Diabetes Consensus Development Conference committee does not recommend changing from the current two-step screening/diagnostic approach to the IADPSG one-step diagnostic approach without trials demonstrating that increasing the number of women diagnosed as having GDM results in better outcomes. In this application, we aim to 1) conduct a real world randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine differences in short-term perinatal health outcomes with GDM testing between the two predominant GDM screening approaches, and 2) prospectively follow the mothers to examine their metabolic risk profiles and the growth of their infants at one year postpartum. Based on a pilot feasibility study, we propose a single site blinded RCT of 920 pregnant women at 18-24 weeks' gestation between ages 18-45 years who have not been diagnosed with diabetes, with a singleton pregnancy. Participants will have a non-fasting 1 hour 50 gm glucose challenge test (GCT) performed between 24-28 weeks' gestation. Women with 50 gm GCT results < 200 mg/dL will be randomized to receive either a fasting 2 hour 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a 3 hour 100 gm OGTT. GDM will be diagnosed using the IADPSG criteria for women receiving the 75 gm OGTT and Carpenter-Coustan criteria for women receiving the 100 gm. Participants and their physicians will be informed of the diagnosis of GDM, but will be blinded to the specific test results and criteria used to make the diagnosis. Participants with GDM will receive treatment as determined by their primary physician or midwife, and all participants will continue routine prenatal care. Brief questionnaires will be used to assess participants' and physicians' views on GDM testing. Metabolic profiles for participants will be assessed at randomization and at a year postpartum. The primary outcome measure is large-for-gestational age fetal growth. The rationale for the proposed research is that this is a unique opportunity to compare the two methods. At the end of the study, we will know whether women diagnosed at lower glucose levels with the IADPSG criteria are more likely to have adverse perinatal outcomes. It is our hypothesis that using IADPSG diagnostic criteria will result in detection of more women with impaired glucose metabolism and that treating these women will reduce adverse perinatal outcomes and prevent long-term metabolic dysfunction. This study will provide data grounded in level A evidence, to evaluate the two screening methods so universal guidelines for GDM screening can be endorsed by major organizations and implemented into clinical care."
"9561217","Project Summary/Abstract (Description): Developmental Funds  NCCC uses discretionary funds in general, and CCSG Developmental Funds in particular, to pursue new  opportunities, promote novel transdisciplinary collaborations, and advance meritorious cancer research. In  response to the 2008 review, we have retained a priority for investment in new faculty recruitment, where  return on investment historically has been highest. Refinement in use of Developmental Funds has been  linked to insights arising from planning and evaluation activities. In response to External Advisor  recommendations, we have emphasized collaborative initiatives, and Members subsequently have secured an  NCI U54 award in Cancer Nanotechnology and NIGMS P20 IDeA multi-project awards in quantitative  biomedical sciences and in molecular epidemiology. NCCC utilizes its five-year Strategic Plan to prioritize  announcements and financing of projects requesting use of developmental funds. The full portfolio of NCCC  developmental approaches includes pilot projects, new faculty funding, interim support, and investment in  advanced technology and new Shared Resource services. Recipients of pilot awards totaling $687,853 in  CCSG funds secured $16.3M in subsequent funding (see Table 2). We have directed pilot project awards to  strategic areas, such as multi-investigator proposals, translational studies, and early phase clinical trials. We  have examples of faculty refocusing on cancer-relevant questions (e.g., Stan [CM]), teams subsequently  securing multi-investigator awards (e.g., Roberts, Paulsen, and Pogue [CIR]), and junior faculty securing peer-  reviewed support (e.g., Danilov [MT]). During the current award period, we received renewal with a 25%  increase in the ACS-IRG pilot award program NCCC conducts. Our most recent call for pilot projects secured  proposals from over 25% of our Members, indicating the value perceived in this opportunity, and we selected 8  of 24 proposals, including at least one from each Program. We have invested $315,000 in CCSG funds in new  faculty recruitments who have secured $10.8M in subsequent peer-reviewed funding (see Table 3). NCCC  has in place policies addressing bridging (resubmission of approved but unfunded proposals) and retention  (preparation of new proposals) support, both of which rely on NCCC discretionary funds rather than CCSG  support. We have utilized NCCC developmental funds to promote Member utilization of new technologies,  including deep-sequencing and preclinical imaging. We have augmented services available to Members  through existing NCCC Shared Resources by developing new capabilities, such as geospatial mapping and  speed congenics. Renewal of CCSG Developmental Funds will support pilot project awards in priority areas  such as translational research, new faculty recruitment in strategic initiatives in early phase clinical  development and cancer immunotherapy, the 2015 opening of the NCCC-directed floor in the adjacent  Williamson Translational Research Building, and collaborative groups around emerging themes such as  precision medicine, surgical innovation, and behavioral interventions aimed at cancer risk reduction."

"9567637","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) interfere with mammalian hormones, and can cause myriad adverse health effects, including developmental effects, neurological effects, reproductive effects, and cancer. One way that EDCs cause disease is by causing epigenomic modifications that change how genes are regulated in specific cells and tissues. It is often not feasible to sample brain tissue in humans, but other tissues lik blood and skin can be readily sampled. This raises the question of whether epigenomic profiles associated with EDC exposure in blood and skin are good surrogates for exposure in brain. The proposed research will test this directly using mice and mouse cells exposed to 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, or dioxin). TCDD is an EDC that affects multiple tissue systems and has adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Mice will be exposed to TCDD during adolescence, a critical time for brain development. The project's objective is to understand how TCDD exposure alters epigenomic profiles in three specific brain regions (cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus), peripheral blood leukocytes, and skin. Comparing these samples will reveal robust epigenomic signatures of TCDD exposure. Importantly, the study will use the genetically diverse mouse Collaborative Cross reference population to better reflect human populations. Some individuals may be more susceptible to TCDD exposure than others, and this experimental design will capture that variation. In parallel, mouse primary cells will be exposed to TCDD in vitro to determine if cell-based systems can accurately reflect the epigenomic modifications seen in tissues. If so, cell-based systems will have many applications for research and for screening potentially hazardous chemicals. The results will be integrated with available public data sources to better understand how mouse epigenomic profiles can be used to predict TCDD effects in humans, and in other affected tissues in mouse and humans."

"9469199","Project Summary The cerebellum is essential for the production of smooth and accurate movements. While much is known about the neurophysiology of cerebellar neurons, our understanding of the mechanistic relationship between cerebellar output and movement is limited. Two prominent hypotheses attempt to explain the function of cerebellar output in motor control: that it operates as a motor command, or as a forward model for state estimation. The motor command hypothesis predicts that cerebellar output contributes to movement directly, while the forward model hypothesis suggests that cerebellar output encodes a prediction that is utilized by downstream motor centers. Previous manipulations of cerebellar output lacked cell-type specificity and used reversible lesions that lasted much longer than a single movement, preventing any causal test of whether cerebellar output functions as a motor command or forward model. To address these limitations, this proposal utilizes a kinematic closed-loop (kCL) system for optogenetics, in which stimulation is triggered by the real-time kinematics of skilled reach behavior in mice. Combining this system with cell-type specific opsin expression in the Interposed Nucleus (IN), the cerebellar nucleus most involved in reaching movements, will allow for short- term, reversible manipulation of cerebellar output at specific kinematic locations of a single reaching movement, differentiating fundamental hypotheses of cerebellar contributions to motor control."
"9561274","ABSTRACT Obesity is a worldwide public health problem, and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity associates with increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally in adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic tumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to solid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity- induced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion, oxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases tumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic therapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk between fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1? (IL-1?)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These abnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular and mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers to successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1? will alleviate obesity-induced desmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have successfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly developed approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the effect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while avoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on obesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if TMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how elevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments with the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia and inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients. These novel treatments can be rapidly translated into the clinic based on our track record of successful clinical translation in collaboration with outstanding clinicians."
"9416010","Project Summary (Research Segment 1) Metazoan organs, including the brain, are composed of various cell types, but the cell type census for even a relatively simple mammalian brain such as the one of the mouse is not available. A whole mouse brain database of molecularly defined cell types organized in a taxonomy and annotated with their precise locations within the brain, would be of unprecedented importance for understanding the functions of mammalian brains. Recent technological advancements have enabled transcriptomic characterization of large numbers of individual cells through single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, a number of methodologies exist, and differences in experimental and analysis methods employed by different labs, animal ages and strains, and spatial resolutions of dissections, make data comparison and integration challenging. In order to create a brain-wide atlas of cell types in the mouse as a standard for the field, we propose to utilize two scRNA-seq technologies at different scales and sequencing depths in a standardized manner across the entire mouse brain, to achieve consistency and comparability across different brain regions. We will compare these two methods, Smart-seq and droplet-based sequencing, to systematically assess to what extent they can distinguish different cell types. We will focus on the non-multiplexed, deeper sequencing method, Smart-seq, to generate a high-quality, foundational single-cell transcriptomic cell type atlas for all brain regions that are also precisely dissected and registered into a mouse brain common coordinate framework so that the spatial origin of each cell or cell type can be easily visualized. We will use RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm expression patterns of cell type-specific gene markers derived from scRNA-seq data and further delineate the anatomical specificity of different cell types. Finally, we will obtain Smart-seq data from a selected set of retrogradely labeled neurons to define the correspondence between transcriptomic cell types and their connectional specificity. We will employ various computational approaches for clustering analysis of the large scRNA-seq datasets, to create a taxonomy of cell types within the whole mouse brain. This dataset will be useful for the entire community to mine and to compare with their own studies using a diverse range of existing and future single cell techniques."
"9328848","Project Summary/Abstract Research demonstrates that extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness dictates the differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) attached to it. Stiffer substrates promote the differentiation of stiffer cell lineages [1]. Photodegradable hydrogels are a novel class of polymeric biomaterials that have been developed by our group at University of California, Los Angeles. They are uniquely suited to replicate the ECM[2, 3] and are physically and chemically similar to the ECM, having a wide range of elastic moduli (~1-500 kPa). Distinctive of photodegradable hydrogels is that their cross-link density can be altered externally, where stiffness is a function of the light intensity and exposure time. This biomaterial can replicate complex, anisotropic, and heterogeneous microenvironments that mimic the structural heterogeneities of native tissue with sub-micron resolutions. This project proposes to advance tissue engineering through the design and use of this photodegradable hydrogel as a high-precision advanced biomaterial, with five degrees of control (three spatial dimensions, time and intrinsic property gradation). I intend to mimic patterns and stiffness gradations found in native tissue interfaces in order to analyze MSC behavior and advance the understanding of stem cell fate in vivo. The mechanical patterns I intend to create will ultimately replicate the inherently complex environments found in nature, such as the developing tooth and the bone-cartilage interface of the mandibular condyle. To date, ECM-based stem cell research has not replicated the body's polarized structures to a degree that allows for an understanding of cell fate in such environments. This research proposal intends to establish how heterogeneous mechanical environments impact MSCs in 2D and 3D culture to subsequently answer the following: Are microenvironments that contain polarized structures dictating stem cell fate? If we engineer an environment to mimic native conditions, will stem cells follow suit? Hypothesis: Photo-tunable polymer networks can be used to structure heterogeneities similar to those found native tissue by inducing a cellular response to mechanical cues. Since it has been established that cell differentiation can be triggered mechanically in static isotropic materials, a system with spatial differences in mechanical properties should trigger multiple cell lineages within a continuous material across a multitude of length and time scales. I also expect that beyond controlling cell phenotype, intermediate behavior, as found in native tissue interfaces, will be observed."
"9475498","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. Over 1.7 million Americans suffer a TBI annually and up to 2% of the population currently lives with the long-term neurological consequences of a previous TBI, placing a $76.5 billion annual economic burden on society. Preventative measures reduce injury incidence and/or severity, yet one-third of hospitalized TBI patients die from injuries that are secondary to the initial trauma. Cerebral edema is a life-threatening neurological complication that promotes elevated ICP and leads to clinical deterioration in the hours and days after a TBI. Further, Inflammation, which contributes toward both CNS injury and repair, involves both immediate non-specific innate immunity and long lasting specific adaptive immunity. Unfortunately, neurosurgical approaches to control elevated ICP are limited and efficacious medical therapies to control cerebral edema and inflammation are lacking, presenting a critical barrier to improving patient prognoses after TBI. Ours is a timely and innovative proposal that will find the link between enhancement of endogenous protection through Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) and activation of immune cells like macrophages and T cells. The objective of this proposal is to test the overarching hypothesis that activation of TRPV1 attenuates the neurovascular injury after TBI by polarizing infiltrating immune cells into anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Our long-term goal is to define the functional roles for TRPV1 after TBI, which will establish a mechanistic framework to advance the development of immuno-modulatory therapeutics to enhance patient outcomes. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1: will test the hypothesis that activation of myeloid TRPV1 promotes neurovascular protection after TBI. Proposed studies will utilize pharmacological, genetic and bone marrow chimera approaches to demonstrate a protective role for TRPV1 activation after TBI. Specific Aim 2: will test the hypothesis that myeloid TRPV1 is required for regulation of T-cells and subsequent chronic recovery after TBI. Proposed studies will utilize myeloid specific TRPV1 knock-in mice to will functionally implicate TRPV1 in T-cell activation and injury resolution after TBI. Expected outcomes include the identification of TRPV1 as a therapeutic target to modulate T cell polarization and injury resolution after TBI. Our proposed studies have far-reaching translational implications, as demonstration of a key role for TRPV1 in TH1/TH17 cells regulation in injury resolution. Chronic immune activation will provide a biomarker to predict recovery in brain injury. Additionally, the results from this study will pave the way for future intensive studies with TRPV1 in co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes etc."

The LBRC has been a leader in Raman technology development with contributions such as: blood glucose sensing toolkits, chemometric algorithms, and clinical Raman spectroscopy systems. In this next cycle, the LBRC pushes technologies in three exciting areas: developing a high-speed multimodal confocal Raman and phase microscopy with enhanced resolution to enhance cellular mechanobiology studies (Aim 3.1), developing technologies for probing cellular nanomechanics and the accompanying biological responses (Aim 3.2), and developing a portable, robust clinical coherent Raman imaging system for the assessment of melanoma and other diseases of the skin in vivo (Aim 3.3). The collaboration with Dr. Kato investigates how sickle red cells aging affects their mechanical properties using Raman imaging of long term glycemic markers to quantify cell age and phase imaging of membrane fluctuations to quantify cell mechanics (CP2). The collaboration with Dr. Raman seeks to dissect organ-specific differences in metastatic breast cancer by determining microenvironment induced biophysical and molecular adaptations (CP5). This collaborative effort will offer mechanistic insights into metastasis organotropism, a critical step towards discovering optimal treatment strategies for specific metastatic lesions to improve overall survival. The ongoing collaborative project with Dr. Fisher will translate current findings on the oncogenic nature of the natural pigment pheomelanin in animal models to human studies focused on the identification and therapy of amelanotic melanomas (CP6)."
"9444128","Project Summary: Core 4, Brain Registration and Pathway Tracing  Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The behavior to be studied is a type of decision-making task that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A full understanding of how this behavior relates to this brain function requires explanation at multiple levels: from neural activity in particular regions to how those regions interact in brain-wide networks via speci??c pathways. These levels of analysis require distinct technical approaches, which are often di??cult to relate to one another rigorously. This Core will promote rigor and reproducibility in the proposed research by producing an anatomical framework to standardize and compare the various types of data that will be collected. The facility will serve several essential functions in building a broad integrative structure for the project. First, it will produce standardized functional maps that will be used to accurately determine the boundaries of visual cortical regions before cellular-resolution imaging or inactivation studies. Second, it will register all studied brain areas into an anatomical context that includes connectivity and functional signi??cance. Automated cell-recognition methods will be used to survey directly imaged regions and indirectly connected regions, and to classify neurons and other objects of interest. Third, it will support long-distance tracing across synapses to identify paths of connectivity between distant brain regions involved in evidence accumulation. Fourth, it will organize this information in a relational database that links all the experiments, in a format that can be shared with the neuroscience research community. As technologies for functional mapping, registration, and tracing advance over time, this facility will evaluate new methods, adopt those that will substantially improve the Core?s capabilities, and train project personnel in their use. Taken together, these functions are essential for placing recorded and perturbed neural activity into a brain-wide anatomical context, which will enable the integration of information produced by individual experiments and techniques into a coherent theoretical framework."
"9380702","CHOP PEDIATRIC CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN NEPHROLOGY ABSTRACT We propose to establish a Pediatric Center of Excellence in Nephrology (PCEN) at the Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Our theme is to address barriers to clinical trials implementation in children with kidney disease. As kidney disease in children is uncommon, identification of adequate numbers of children with specific disorders and recruitment for trials is difficult. Additionally, methods to clinically phenotype children with kidney disease in terms of growth, development, nutritional issues, cardiovascular disease risk factors, bone and mineral disorders often vary from study to study, and quality control is variable. Expertise in study design and analysis is needed to achieve appropriate inferences from observational data, and to design clinical trials, however, frequently pediatric centers in nephrology lack this expertise. We will address these challenges through a regional and national collaboration of clinical and translational researchers at CHOP, Johns Hopkins, and children?s hospitals participating in PEDSnet. PEDSnet is a consortium of eight academic pediatric health centers that collectively provide care for >4.5 million children. PEDSnet has established a common institutional review board and has harmonized the diverse EHR systems of its participating centers to create a standardized multi-institutional data network in order to facilitate the efficient conduct of observational research, quality improvement and clinical trials. The CHOP-PCEN will have three biomedical research cores; a Design and Analysis core, a Clinical Phenotyping Core focused on CVD risk factors and Nutrition/Bone health, a Learning Health System (LHS) Core, as well as a pilot and feasibility program and an enrichment core. We include 2 research project proposals utilizing the cores: ?Bone Quality and Vascular Health in Adolescents with Urinary Stone Disease?, ?Derivation and Validation of Imaging Biomarkers for CKD Progression? and a third, integrated into the LHS core, ?Skeletal Outcomes in Children and Young Adults with Glomerular Disease?. The research base is comprised of 39 investigators, who are PI?s, co-investigators or collaborators on over 150 funded projects totaling over $35 million in annual direct costs, over $12 million of this funding is in research projects relevant to pediatric nephrology led by likely users of the core services. The PCEN will build upon the strong foundation of clinical research at CHOP and Hopkins, as well as the University of Penn Adult Nephrology Division and Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics to catalyze the design and implementation of clinical trials in children with kidney disease."
"9566479","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precision medicine for cancer requires knowledge of the driver mutations in a particular patient's tumor. Recent single cell genetic studies have shown that driver mutations and cancer cell subtype are highly heterogeneous within a single patient. Thus, clinicians will need to employ experimental methods that allow observation of a variety of molecular analytes across many individual cells within a particular patient's tumor section in situ. Current tumor section analyses are not highly multiplexed and typically remain limited to ~4-5 analytes, or 7 with multi-spectral imaging. Recent technologies have pushed this number into 30s-60s, but they require expensive equipment and/or reagents, sophisticated analyses or markedly increased assay time, all of which would preclude their practical use in many clinical pathology and preclinical research laboratories. Thus, there remains a significant need for technologies that multiplex measurements in tumor sections but are widely accessible and cost-effective. We focus on addressing this need with a readily-adoptable but novel multi- spectral fluorescence-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that the power of combinatorics can be harnessed to vastly increase the number of quantifiable analytes in a mixture by permuting the wide array of available fluorophores in new ways. We term our approach combinatorial fluorescence with spectral imaging (CoFSI). CoFSI only requires the ability to perform multi-channel fluorescence excitation and emission spectral scanning, which is widely available and easy to implement in most plate/slide readers and many microscopes. Data analysis involves a straightforward, fast computational technique called linear unmixing. Preliminary simulation studies suggest that the concentrations of 123 different CoFSI probes constructed from 16 existing fluorescent proteins can be estimated simultaneously with good accuracy and precision across 3 orders of concentration magnitude with a large number of excitation channels, and 48 probes with 6 excitation channels. Similar simulation studies constrained by available tumor section imaging equipment and Alexa dyes suggest 25 simultaneous measurements are possible. Initial pilot experiments demonstrate that seven different CoFSI probe levels in a mixture can be measured both accurately and precisely using only the blue-yellow part of the spectrum. This proposal further tests the limits of CoFSI experimentally, and applies CoFSI to tumor section imaging, with two Aims: (1) Quantify the Levels of 48 Fluorescent Probes in a Mixture Simultaneously; and (2) Quantify the Spatial Distribution of 25 Analytes in Tumor Sections. If successful, CoFSI can increase quantitative fluorescence multiplexing at least ~5 to 10-fold while relying on standard lab resources and straightforward analyses. CoFSI is also feasibly compatible with other difficult-to-multiplex technologies such as high content screening, live-cell imaging, and in vivo rodent imaging, and thus may have broad impact."

"9386284","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions."

"9386099","Summary IFGeneRA Project 1 Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability worldwide. It is transmitted as an X-linked recessive condition, primarily affecting males with mental retardation but also causing early menopause in about 20% of female carriers. Following the establishment of a Medical Genetic Unit in Yaound Cameroon, the consultation of a mother of two sons affected with mental retardation allowed a molecular analysis that revealed FXS (Family 1). The patients belonged to an exceptionally big family with multiple affected members from Babadjou, a village in rural Cameroon. The hallmark of Babadjou is the large number of families with ? 1 members affected with mental retardation. To explain the disease inheritance pattern, the belief is that during the foundation of this village, Chief K killed a mentally delayed individual, and that this man cursed Chief K and his descendants. Thereafter, all 20 wives of Chief K gave birth to at least one grandchild with mental retardation. By revealing FXS, the genetic testing has in some way revealed an explanation for ?chief K's legendary curse?. The founder of the village was likely ?a normal transmitting male?, meaning that all his daughters would have been carriers and 50% of the grand-sons would be affected by FXS. The Babadjou Royal Family and village offers a unique opportunity to study, in the context of rural Africa, the psychological, social and genetic counselling impact of the return of individual genetic results. We will use the findings of this project to produce a documentary on the experience of affected families members and the lay public on the relation between genetic and traditional knowledge. Aim 1: To retrospectively explore the impact of the FXS diagnosis on Family 1, who received results of their diagnosis in 2011, and members of their extended family. Under this aim, we will explore the impact of receiving a genetic diagnosis on the mother of Family 1 and any individuals she shared her sons' diagnosis with. Aim 2: To explore community views on FXS, the curse explaining patterns of inheritance, traditional knowledge of genetics and gendered blame. Under this aim, we will conduct an ethnographic study of the Babadjou community using participant observations, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions to better understand the impact of FXS on the community, explore explanatory disease models (`the curse') and traditional understandings of genetics."
"9258809","Project Summary Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is compromising our ability to treat infection. Of alarming concern is emerging carbapenem resistance amongst members of the Enterobacteriaceae (so called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CRE) such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. Heretofore, carbapenems were the class of antibiotics of last resort against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Acquisition of broadly acting enzymes that destroy these drugs has made treatment of CRE problematic at best. Alternative treatments are either absent or highly toxic. Accordingly, the CDC has classified CRE as an urgent threat. There is pressing need for novel antimicrobials and new antimicrobial target identification. Importantly, bacteria containing the same functional carbapenemase enzymes show marked differences in susceptibility to carbapenems, suggesting that carbapenem resistance is multi-factorial. In fact, some strains remain clinically susceptible both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore hypothesize that novel adjunctive antimicrobials can be found that modulate factors contributing to resistance and thereby restore the efficacy of carbapenems in non-susceptible strains. Therefore, this proposal will use a comprehensive, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify novel compounds that either directly inhibit CRE and/or render CRE susceptible to carbapenems. Following identification, we aim to characterize the mechanism of action of these novel compounds and gain insight into mechanisms of carbapenem resistance and CRE antimicrobial effect. The long-term goal is to use this knowledge to develop novel effective therapies for CRE."

Our team will develop new methodologies to objectively reconstruct past chemical exposures, allowing researchers to study susceptibility windows as they relate to child health. Four laboratory resources/cores will be established to achieve these goals; 1) a targeted analysis resource that will analyze common environmental exposure biomarkers (metals, pesticides, flame retardants, endocrine disrupting chemicals, tobacco metabolites, vitamins, nutritional status, minerals, and other organic compounds) using state-of-the-art analytical methodologies; 2) an untargeted analysis resource using advanced technologies such as time-of- flight mass spectrometry to discover the chemicals, metabolites and other biomarkers that are associated with child health and disease; 3) a biological response indicators resource that will link environmental exposures to changes in immune function, epigenomic marks, gene expression, noncoding RNA and other response biomarkers; and 4) we will establish a developmental core that will create novel methods to measure current and past chemical exposures in new biological matrices (e.g. teeth, placenta), develop new assays to study emerging toxicants, and develop new methods to assess the body's response to exposure. An Administrative Core will be established to coordinate planning and communication externally with the CHEAR Coordinating Center, the CHEAR Data Center and the other CHEAR Network Laboratory Hubs. Internally, the Administration Core will integrate work among our Resources/Cores to streamline and prioritize job orders, assess assay needs, promote and disseminate new assays as they are developed, harmonize protocols and QA/QC procedures and coordinate day to day operations. This laboratory Hub will advise applicants on sample requirements, sample quality, results interpretation, sample collection, storage protocols and sample shipping specifications. Both analysis and interpretation of Lab Hub-generated data will be supported in cooperation with the Data Center; and if necessary, we will outreach to outside laboratories with analytic capabilities/expertise that do not reside in our Lab Hub. In conclusion, this proposal links highly experienced environmental health scientists with pediatricians, toxicologists, stress researchers, chemists, exposure scientists, epidemiologists, computer scientists, immunologists, and epigeneticists to build the infrastructure and capacity to objectively measure child environments."

Neural circuits that develop under abnormal environmental conditions can become disrupted and no longer function normally, which can lead to obesity and associated negative health consequences. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the hindbrain receives and integrates visceral nutritional status, and primarily sends this information to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalmus (PVH), which coordinates energy balance and neuroendocrine responses. Leptin receptors (LepRb) in NTS neurons have been shown to impact food intake and metabolic rate. In addition to leptin's role in satiety signaling, it also functions as a neurotrophic factor in development. Leptin is required for normal  axon outgrowth from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to the PVH. Because leptin receptors are expressed by neurons in the NTS during development (including a large proportion of GLP-1 neurons), leptin may direct formation of this pathway. Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 1 will test whether leptin is required for normal development of neural projections from GLP-1 neurons in the NTS to the PVH. Genetically targeted axonal labels and immunohistochemistry will be used to visualize and quantify GLP-1 neurons in the NTS and their projections in leptin-deficient Lepob/ob mice in development and adulthood. Experiments proposed in Specific Aim 2 will utilize a molecular genetic approach to establish the site of action for leptin's neurotrophic action on NTS GLP-1 neurons and characterize the physiological role of this pathway. Together these studies promise to establish the GLP-1 projection pathway from the NTS to the PVH as a developmentally programmable substrate that determines significant aspects of metabolic physiology."
"9564255","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        This is the first competing renewal application for the Environmental Health Sciences (EHS) Core Center at the University of Michigan, submitted in the final year of the initial four years of NIEHS support.  The Center is organized around the theme of critical windows of susceptibility to environmental exposures as important determinants of disease, forming the Michigan Center of Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease (M- LEEaD).  Lifestage, as used in this application, refers to clinically-recognized stages of development, mid-life, and aging that pertain to the preconception, prenatal, infant, child, adolescent, reproductive age adult, and aging adult periods of life.  The Center builds on a strong foundation of research activity and support at the University of Michigan in this emergent arena of environmental public health, with 16 NIEHS grants moving into the next funding period that includes a Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center and participation in a Superfund Research Program Center. The mission of M-LEEaD is to accelerate research that defines impacts of environmental exposures during vulnerable stages of life, and to promote translation of these findings to improve medical and public health interventions for the mitigation of chronic disease. The Center implements its mission through infrastructural support of established and new investigators applying novel transdisciplinary approaches that increase understanding of mechanisms by which environmental exposures target vulnerable stages of life. Support for research is provided through integrated Center programs that include a Pilot Project Program, three Facility Cores, and three Research Teams to create synergy for stimulation of innovative research.

"9450004","ABSTRACT Ovarian cancer remains an important cause of female cancer-related deaths, with approximately 22,440 new cases and about 14,080 deaths predicted for 2017. Consistent with the objective of this proposal, there is an urgent need to identify better targets for therapy against advanced and drug-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most malignant and lethal of the gynecological cancers. One such possibility is c-MYC, an oncogene highly abundant in most cancers, including HGSOC. Previous studies by our research team using ?The Cancer Genome Atlas? (TCGA) data portal showed that recurrence of HGSOC occurred faster for patients with higher c-MYC expression. In addition, small-interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated c-MYC silencing decreased cell proliferation and reduced tumor growth in an ovarian cancer mouse model. Together, these results suggest that c-MYC could be a clinically relevant target for HGSOC patients. Although the molecular mechanisms of c-MYC overexpression have been extensively studied in different types of cancer, the mechanism leading to c-MYC up-regulation in HGSOC have not been addressed. Preliminary results from our research team indicate that c-MYC could be regulated post-transcriptionally by microRNAs in HGSOC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can potentially bind to thousands of different messenger RNAs and inhibit protein synthesis. By using bioinformatics and molecular studies we identified several miRNAs that potentially regulate c-MYC expression in ovarian cancer cells. Most important, transient transfection of oligonucleotide miRNA mimics for those miRNAs showed that miR-98, miR-106a and miR-18a significantly decreased the c-MYC protein levels, and reduced the cell proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Together, our data provide insight into novel mechanisms of c-MYC regulation in HGSOC. Our overall hypothesis is that miR-98, miR-106a and miR-18a post-transcriptionally regulate c-MYC expression in HGSOC. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that c-MYC regulates key genes associated with cell survival and with the cisplatin resistance of HGSOC cells. This hypothesis will be addressed by pursuing the following Specific Aims: (1) identify the microRNAs post-transcriptionally regulating c-MYC expression in HGSOC cells; (2) investigate the biological consequences and therapeutic effects of siRNA-mediated c-MYC silencing in combination with miR-98, miR-106a or miR-18a mimics, in HGSOC; and (3) elucidate the c-MYC downstream effectors in ovarian cancer cells. Our contribution to the field of molecular mechanisms of drug resistance will be a detailed elucidation of the Upstream Regulation and Downstream Effectors of c-MYC in HGSOC. In response to one of the main missions of the ?Center for Collaborative Research in Health Disparities? (RCMI), this proposal will improve the participation of researchers in minority institutions in basic and translational cancer research and will result in the training of local graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge technology and novel concepts in cancer research."
"9370324","Core 002 - Abstract   In this revised version we had actualize the role of lung tissue core and the numbers of  samples collected. This core will be compromise by three centralized subcores, each of which  is essential to reach the goals of this program application. The Core includes, a bio-bank sub-  core collecting biological samples from patients and organ donors through the University of  Pittsburgh, an ex-vivo lung perfusion sub-core, to study lung function, pathology, and  hemodynamics of lungs maintained under ex-vivo perfusion, and an ex-vivo 3-D human lung  tissue model sub-core, to generate sections of lung tissue that can be culture for long  periods of time. All three components are essential for the mechanistic and translational  research goals of this Program application.   The Specific Aims for the Core are: 1. To enrich our current biorepository of lung, skin  and bone marrow stem cells procured from normal individuals and individuals with SSc. 2. To  assist program investigators in the design and implementation of experiments using biological  specimens from the biobank.   Research Plan: The bio-bank will provide tissue samples of lung, skin and bone  marrow stem cells procured from normal individuals and individuals with SSc. We will include  the collection of lung and skin fibroblasts, bone marrow derived stem cells, endothelial cells,  and smooth muscle cells, as well as tissue samples for RNA, DNA, protein and histopathology  analyses. The ex-vivo lung perfusion sub-core will provide a preclinical translational model  for the test of therapeutic candidates. The ex-vivo 3-D human lung tissue model sub-core  will provide a collection of pulmonary arteries for biomechanical analyses, and agarose  embedded tissue for ex-vivo 3D lung organ culture.   Significance and synergy: Comparative studies between human and mice of  responses to systemic inflammation demonstrate marked differences and poor correlations  between the two species, confirming the difficulties in the use of animal models to mimic  human diseases. There is a need of more preclinical studies using human specimens to  answer fundamental questions in complex diseases such as systemic sclerosis. All Research  Projects will use resources of the lung tissue core to: 1) test mechanistic hypotheses of the  pathogenesis of SSc, 2) test the efficacy of new therapeutics in established ex vivo lung  perfusion model and 3-D human lung tissue model, and 3) evaluate molecular mechanisms in  human biological samples."
"9430822","The Zika virus (ZIKV) of the flaviviridae family of viruses poses a significant threat to the health of newborn infants and young children. ZIKV infection predominantly affects the development of the nervous system and its neurotopism has been well-established. In September 2016, ZIKV was linked to sensorineural hearing loss in newborn infants that were prenatally exposed, but essentially nothing is known about where the developmental pathologies lie in the auditory pathway. Reports of abnormal otoacoustic emissions in ZIKV-exposed infants suggest that at least some of the sensorineural defects may originate within the cochlea, the auditory organ of the inner ear. This study will focus on correlating the timing of ZIKV exposure at embryonic and perinatal stages to the types of inner ear cells that become infected, using two animal models (chicken and mice). Preliminary data show that ZIKV can infect the cochlea, in particular the sensory domain, the stria vascularis (tegmentum vasculosum in the chicken cochlea) and the auditory ganglion. The proposed studies will involve delivery of ZIKV directly to the embryonic inner ear and the cochlea to assess cellular tropism and otic pathogenesis associated with ZIKV. Aim 1 will determine the cellular tropism and timing of ZIKV infection in ovo by direction injection of virus into the chicken otocyst from embryonic day (E) 3?5. Virus distribution, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression related to innate immune responses will be assayed several days after infection. Aim 2 will determine the cellular tropism and timing of ZIKV infection in vitro in embryonic (E12.5, E15.5) and neonatal (postnatal day 1) mouse cochlea cultures. Genetic labeling of hair cells, supporting cells, or intermediate cells of the stria vascularis will aid in following the fates of these cell types for up to 6 days in culture. Virus distribution, cell proliferation, apoptosis, hair cell ultrastructure, and hair cell mechanotransduction will be evaluated several days after ZIKV exposure. Antibody blocking experiments will be used to explore the role of the periotic mesenchyme as a direct target of ZIKV. These studies should aid in understanding how ZIKV infection of the developing sensory periphery might contribute to sensorineural hearing loss in human infants."

"9565275","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CaC) Research Program is a newly restructured transdisciplinary program that serves as the hub for cancer control and population science research within the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and the State of New Mexico (NM), our catchment area. The Program's overall goal is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in the unique multiethnic and underserved populations of NM. Disparities research is a cross-cutting theme that fosters scientific focus and synergy across the research areas. Through vigorous strategic program planning and evaluation, recruitment of 9 new investigators to enhance expertise in molecular epidemiology and behavioral/community intervention, and guidance of the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, the CaC Program is now focused on three areas of cancer research: 1) Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction; 2) Screening; and 3) Post-Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship. Unique scientific strengths include research addressing disparities (geographic, race/ethnic, socioeconomic, medically underserved), particularly in etiologic, outcome, and intervention studies in Hispanics. By drawing on established and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real- world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post- Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post- treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by Linda Cook, Ph.D. and Anita Kinney, Ph.D., RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9 associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014. The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively."
"9377854","Overall Abstract The goals of the Endometrial Cancer SPORE at MD Anderson Cancer Center are the following: 1) develop novel therapeutic strategies for advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer and aggressive subtypes; 2) promote novel strategies for unmet clinical needs in prevention and conservative therapy of high-risk precancerous lesions and low grade endometrial cancer; 3) incorporate molecular diagnostics into clinical decision-making; and 4) recruit and support new investigators in endometrial cancer research through the Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs. This parent proposal includes 4 translational research projects addressing scientific problems that span the breadth of endometrial cancer heterogeneity in an effort to impact as many patients as possible. Project 1, ?Novel Targeted Strategies for Prevention and Conservative Management of Complex Atypical Hyperplasia and Grade 1 Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer,? includes a phase II trial using the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to improve standard conservative therapy (progestin-eluting intrauterine device) and is paired with innovative molecular profiling and pharmacologic approaches to further advance conservative treatment options. Project 2, ?CTNNB1 Mutation and Wnt Pathway Activation Define Clinically Aggressive Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma,? focuses on targeted therapeutics and molecular mechanisms underlying a clinically aggressive subtype of endometrioid endometrial cancer. It is hypothesized that CTNNB1 mutation and Wnt pathway activation promote immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, which enables tumor progression and recurrence. Project 3, ?EphA2 Targeting in Uterine Carcinoma,? focuses on the therapeutic target, EphA2, which is overexpressed in higher grade endometrioid carcinomas and serous carcinoma and is associated with poor overall survival. A phase I clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a novel therapeutic (EPHARNA; developed by Project 3 investigators) that targets EphA2 by delivering short interfering RNA into tumor cells via a neutral liposome nanovehicle. Project 4, ?Rational Combinatorial Therapy in Endometrial Cancer,? will evaluate tumor molecular changes from biopsies procured during a combinatorial trial of PARP and PI3K pathway targeted therapy to identify biomarkers of benefit for patients with endometrial cancer. This is paired with implementing a testing platform to evaluate mechanisms responsible for adaptive resistance to targeted therapies in order to enable design of improved combination therapies for endometrial cancer. The proposed expansion project will elaborate upon the themes of Project 2 and examine the impact of PTEN loss and loss of CD73-generated adenosine signaling in the development of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Completion of this expansion project and Project 2 will help us to identify more precisely molecular modifiers of the local tumor microenvironment and will aid in the development of more rational immune-based therapy strategies."
"9436158","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed project will examine emotional functioning in adolescents and young adults who are at heightened risk for imminently developing a psychotic disorder (i.e., ultra-high-risk [UHR] youth), focusing on interactions with their parental caregivers. While alterations in emotional functioning have been observed in individuals with psychosis and in UHR youth, the field has primarily focused on corroborative, self-report, and clinical interview-based measures, and as a result, currently has a limited understanding of how in-depth, dynamic interactions may play a pathogenic role. The current proposal is notable in linking across multiple modalities during experimental laboratory-based dyadic interactions to understand how emotional functioning in both UHR youth and caregivers predicts symptoms, social functioning, and clinical course over time. The first aim of the proposed research is to determine differences in emotional functioning during interaction between UHR-youth and caregivers compared to control youth and caregivers. This is of particular importance given that there are well-documented alterations in socioemotional functioning in UHR youth. Yet these alterations have rarely been examined in social contexts of key emotional significance, such as during interactions with their parental caregivers. Moreover, no studies have aimed to differentiate patterns of abnormality from developmentally normative emotional functioning during conflict interactions. The second aim is to determine which contexts reveal physiological vulnerability in UHR youth compared to control youth. Alterations in resting state autonomic physiology are a well-documented vulnerability factor in psychopathology, but have rarely been examined during negative (which put unique demands on the autonomic nervous system), neutral, and positive youth-caregiver interactions. The third aim is to evaluate whether emotional functioning during interactions in youth and caregivers predicts youth's symptoms and broader real-life social functioning concurrently and prospectively (over a period of 12 months). There is a large literature implicating caregivers' expressed emotions (EE) in psychosis, but no research has assessed emotional functioning in both youth and caregivers simultaneously during interaction. By delineating specific emotional qualities of UHR youth-caregiver interactions and identifying specific aspects of emotional functioning in both UHR youth as well as caregivers that put UHR youth further at risk, the proposed project will provide the foundation for identifying specific treatment targets for larger studies with both youth and caregivers."
"9358641","The overarching goal of this application is to provide a high quality mentored research experience for promising students in the rapidly growing area of genome sciences and precision medicine. Students interested in pursuing a career in genome sciences and medicine research will require a strong foundation of core genome sciences technology and inter-disciplinary training. We propose a 10-week summer program that will include a mentored research project in genome sciences and medicine, didactic and interactive training, and interaction with academic and industry scientists. The program will be open to undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minorities (URM), at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and Duke University. Students will have a range of research opportunities to select from the pool of 34 mentors working on projects in applied genome sciences, data sciences, translational genomic medicine, bioinformatics and computational biology, engineering, and statistics. The summer program builds upon our rich experience in undergraduate mentorship and training by the former Duke Institute of Genome Sciences & Policy (IGSP) and currently administered by the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology (GCB) and past partnership with NCCU. Through these programs, we have accepted more than 150 students, 22% of whom are from under-represented minorities and more than half of whom are women; several have successfully continued their research throughout their undergraduate career and been accepted into leading graduate programs and medical schools around the country. The research experience will be complemented by a series of training lectures and interactive learning activities from the core GCB facilities (proteomics/ metabolomics, sequencing, microarrays, and biostatistics), visits to NCCU and companies using genome sciences technologies or data in their research in nearby Research Triangle Park, and science-related community service activities. In addition, students will have the opportunity to consider broader issues impacted by their research through a weekly discussion on the ethical, legal, social, and policy issues and gain important skills such as critical reading a scientific paper, leading a discussion group, conducting literature reviews, and making formal presentations. All students will be required to present their research at the conclusion of the program. If needed to ensure a diverse student group each summer, we will expand our recruitment to other schools in the region, including several Historically Black Universities and Colleges (HBUCs) and establish partnerships with other local institutions during the course of the award to expand the student pool. In summary, students in this program will benefit from the rich and highly interdisciplinary resources available at Duke for genome sciences and medicine research."
"9433358","Project Summary / Abstract Parameter-free Peak Detection Algorithm for Reducing False Positive/Negative Compound Identification from Raw Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics Data Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to liquid or gas chromatography (LC or GC) have become indispensable analyt- ical platforms for untargeted metabolomics. With sensitivity, chromatographic resolution, and mass measurement accuracy continuously improving, more and more analytes are now detectable, and this has enormous potential to lead to great strides in our understanding of metabolism. The first step in the preprocessing of raw LC- and GC-MS metabolomics data is the detection and extraction of peaks that represent ions. However, existing peak detection algorithms invariably yield an immense number of false positive and false negative peaks. These incorrect peaks can translate downstream into spurious or missing compound identifications. Furthermore, a large number of parameters must be specified for these algorithms to work. Unfortunately, general users often do not understand how to optimize these parameters, and maximizing one aspect (e.g., sensitivity) often has deleterious effects on another (e.g., specificity). To address the challenges, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of peaks by simultaneously considering the three dimension of an ion?s information. This will significantly increase the accuracy of peak detection compared to what can be achieved by existing algorithms that carry out peak detection by processing data in three separate 2D planes. The results of our proposed research will benefit metabolomics research in multiple ways. (1) The more accurate algorithm will eliminate or reduce manual checking of results to a minimum. (2) With the parameter-free design, researchers will not have to go through many rounds of trial-and- error to determine the best compromise for a set of processing parameters. (3) The more accurate algorithm will provide greater confidence in the detection of truly unknown compounds and allow prioritization of candidates for more detailed and costly structural analysis. (4) The more accurate algorithm will benefit biomarker discovery by increasing the accuracy of quantitative metabolite information extracted from the raw metabolomics data."
"9482071","Abstract The elimination of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from its central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral reservoirs is a requirement for a disease-cure. To our knowledge, we are the first to have achieved this goal in tests performed in a limited number of infected humanized mice. To validate such early successes we propose to build a four-step ladder with a final crest of latent virus eradication. First, a newly developed humanized mouse brain-lymphoid model of neuroAIDS will identify productively infected perivascular and meningeal macrophages and restricted infection in parenchymal cells. This rodent model most closely reflects human brain disease as demonstrated by robust molecular, virologic and neuroimmunologic tests. Second, long acting slow effective release antiretroviral therapy (LASER ART) also now fully developed in our laboratories can now facilitate a pinpoint localization of the latently infected viral brain reservoir. Third, viral excision strategies will be employed to eliminate residual virus and preclude HIV reactivation. The gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by Temple University Medical Center investigators including CCR5 and viral excision strategies will reduce then eliminate any ongoing infection and integrated proviral DNA from infected cells. The CRISPR/Cas9 constructs will deliver its cargo to brain and peripheral tissue sites using specific serotypes of adeno-associated virus. This will enable permanent HIV eradication in humanized mice without viral reactivation and as such preclude any ongoing brain infection and subsequent neural damage. Fourth, in order to prove the therapeutic strategy effective both for brain and peripheral lymphoid tissue virus (including the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, lymph node, spleen and genitourinary system) we will cease ART administrations and following time periods measured in months to provide cross validating evidence for viral eradication by measure rebound. Given the risks associated with HIV reactivation in the CNS this approach must show effectiveness for its abilities to target latent virus. Taken together, the proposal seeks support to employ combination LASER ART and potent molecular viral and immune-based regimens for elimination of viral depots. The overall premise is to develop the ?state of the art? tools required to permanently eliminate virus detected in the CNS and peripheral infectious reservoirs."
"9346816","Enteric glial cells (EGCs) regulate intestinal homeostasis and may be involved in purinergic signaling and motility, but their precise role is not understood, especially in humans. In the inflamed state, they convert to a `more reactive phenotype', releasing inflammatory mediators that could contribute to pathophysiology. PROBLEM: The role of human EGCs (hEGCs) in the physiology and pathophysiology of the GI tract is not known, and addressing this critical gap in knowledge is important in determining how hEGCs modulate GI functions in health and disease. Our preliminary data support the concept that purinergic signals in hEGCs regulate cellular communication, synaptic physiology, motor behavior, and inflammatory signals. Significance of these translational studies is underscored by significant species differences in glial responses, mechanisms and a 7 fold higher glial to neuron ratio in human ENS (versus mouse). Groundbreaking ? mechanistic, translational studies are proposed on `mechanosensitivity', `modulation of motility' and postoperative ileus. It became necessary to develop and apply sophisticated new technologies to study i.e. mechanical stimulation (pressure, shear stress, radial stretch) of hEGCs, currents, Vm, Ca2+waves, monitor ATP release using a `sniffer cell', spaciotemporal imaging of motility, and gene expression (i.e. RiboTag mouse & a 107-custom gene readout of `reactive glia'). Studies on surgical trauma/intestinal manipulation, IL1? or conditioned media from hEGCs provide precise ways to study `reactive glia' in human gut. OVERALL HYPOTHESIS: ?Human EGCs are critical regulators of mechanosensitivity, cell-to-cell communication, synaptic physiology, neuromuscular transmission and motility in the human intestinal tract and inflammation disrupts their normal activity. Purinergic signaling plays a pivotal role in `function and dysfunction'. EGCs exert inhibitory modulation of neural network activity. EGCs may exert differential (opposing) effects in the two muscle layers by acting in the ENS to modulate ascending and descending phases of the peristaltic reflex and coordinate or synchronize motility. Glial activation disrupts motility in postoperative ileus. Studies are supported by a dream team of investigators with a record of collaboration, a superb environment, strong preliminary data (Figs 1-16), 2 new publications in `Inflammatory Bowel Diseases' in 2016 and one revised publication to `GLIA' on the `basic hEGC model'. Our overall hypothesis is tested in 4 original Aims. AIM 1: To investigate mechanotransduction pathways of ATP release in hEGCs. AIM 2: To evaluate mechanosensory transduction and glial communication in the ENS of intact neural plexus networks in human intestine. AIM 3: To determine the role of hEGCs in the modulation of motility. AIM 4: To determine the impact of inflammation in postoperative ileus on reactive glia and motility and use human tissue to the extent it is possible. IMPACT: Translational studies will fill a critical gap in knowledge of glia in the `little brain' of the human gut in health and disease, with implications for motility disorders, gut inflammation and therapeutics."

"9405683","Severe, exacerbation-prone asthma impacts 5-10% of the asthma population and continues to have substantial human and economic impact, with nearly 2 million emergency room visits and 0.5 million hospitalizations per year. Evidence from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) supports the heterogeneity of severe asthma, with substantial evidence to suggest differentiation of these patients into 2 broad categories based on biomarker evidence for the presence/absence of Type(T)-2 (IL-4, 5, -13) associated inflammation. Concurrent industry sponsored clinical trials have further supported this broad differentiation, with evidence for substantial efficacy of T2-targeted biologic therapies including those targeted to IL-4/13 and IL-5 pathways in T2Hi asthma patients. However, the best biomarkers to predict response to T2-targeted therapies are not yet clear. Given their enormous costs, it is critical to better understand and identify those who most need these medications, which ones to utilize first and in which patients. It is even more unclear whether specific biomarkers in patients with no (using current biomarker) evidence for T2 inflammation exist or whether they predict targeted biologic approaches for these patients. The adaptive design trial proposed here will utilize currently accepted biomarkers, as well as additional exploratory bio-imaging and genetic markers to predict the most efficacious and safe approaches for these broad (but then more specific) T2-phenotypes. We therefore hypothesize that an adaptive trial design integrating T2 (and non-T2) biomarkers, targeted therapies and clinically relevant outcomes will improve the understanding of the pathobiology of severe asthma patients on medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with or without long acting ??2 agonists (LABA) phenotypes and bring the most efficacious (and safest) medication to each severe asthma patient. We propose a multiphase adaptive trial design in 800 poorly controlled, exacerbating and/or severe asthmatic and/or oral corticosteroids (OCS). The 1st (run-in) phase will establish each participant's baseline over a 3-6 month period of time, while repeatedly measuring established and exploratory biomarkers. The data from this run-in phase will be used to assign the patient to a T2Hi or -Lo molecular phenotype and inform the modeling of predictive factors to be applied during the targeted treatment phase. The targeted treatment phase will consist of 3 treatments, adaptively applied to the two broad T2 phenotypes, with the intention to support the importance of potential T2 sub-phenotypes, such as a T2Hi/Mast cell-Hi and T2Lo/Metabolic. The 3 treatments will differ by starting T2 phenotype, but the primary endpoint for each intervention will be treatment failure defined by a biomarker and clinical index. T2Hi interventions will sequentially include a CRTH2 antagonist, an anti-IL-4Receptor(R) antibody and a soluble TNF-? receptor, while T2Lo interventions will include anti-IL-4R, an anti-IL-6/6Rreceptor and bronchial thermoplasty. These studies will greatly expand on the precision medicine pathway to improve the care of severe, exacerbation-prone asthma."
"9365203","PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychosis is a mental disorder that manifests as a range of symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions. These symptoms reflect a diminished ability to accurately recognize self-generated sensations from externally caused actions or thoughts. This difficulty in differentiating and classifying actions and thoughts as self-initiated or external has been collectively referred to as a disturbance in sense of agency (SoA). One theory is that disruptions in corollary discharge (CD, the internally generated copy of issued motor commands) underlie the SoA defects demonstrated in psychosis. However, due to the inherent subjectivity of quantifying self-experience there is difficulty in objectively evaluating abnormal experiences of agency across patient populations. This difficulty subsequently prevents defining the role of CD in agency, as well as identifying the disrupted neural circuits that convey these signals. The research objective of this application is to develop a sensitive, quantitative perceptual assessment of CD utilization in order to define the continuum of abnormalities in SoA in psychotic disorders, and isolate the principal neural circuit disruptions associated with the behavioral abnormalities. The central hypothesis of the application is that (1) deficits in CD transmission contribute to visual perception impairments in patient populations that experience psychosis and (2) a neural circuit, previously characterized in primates, that conveys the saccade CD underlies the visual perception impairments observed in human psychotic disorders. The research uses human psychophysics, clinical evaluations, statistical analysis and brain imaging to isolate the continuum of neural circuit disruptions associated with the range of observed behavioral abnormalities. The hypothesis of the application has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data that (1) demonstrate that a visual perception behavioral paradigm can isolate and quantitatively assess CD utilization, (2) identify the associated CD neural circuitry in monkeys, (3) probe the perceptual consequences when this circuit is reversibly disrupted and (4) confirm similar perceptual deficits in schizophrenia patients. The long-term goal of the research is to understand the role of CD in SoA, and how the disruption of these signals contribute to the clinical symptoms of psychosis. The expected outcome of the research is to provide detailed information, from behavior to the neural pathways, on the contribution of CD disruption to SoA disorders. This contribution is significant because it will provide a precise neurobehavioral model to develop analytical diagnostics and treatment strategies for abnormal self-experience."
"9449964","Chronic pain is a major public health challenge, affecting 100 million adults in the United States and  resulting in over $600 billion annually in treatment costs and lost productivity. African-American (AA) adults are  disproportionately affected by daily and chronic pain and report higher pain severity and greater pain-related  disability across a variety of conditions. Compared to non-minorities with similar pain conditions, AA adults  have poorer physical functioning, greater impairment at work and home, and lower quality of life. Daily bodily  pain is common and often a precursor to chronic pain. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to daily  pain in AA adults is critical for prevention efforts targeting vulnerable adults before they develop debilitating  and difficult to treat chronic pain conditions. Daily pain is more likely to become chronic in adults who have  experienced adversity. Compared to non-minorities, AA adults report greater exposure to childhood trauma,  family adversity, interpersonal violence, and racial discrimination. Thus, AA adults are impacted by disparities  in risk factors for pain (adversity) and by chronic pain itself. Although the mechanisms linking adversity to daily  pain in AA adults have not been clearly delineated, two promising pathways involve alterations of stress  response systems (i.e., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis) and pain sensitivity. The HPA axis plays an  important role in stress-induced analgesia and may account, in part, for the relation between adversity and  pain. Chronic and traumatic stressors are associated with diminished cortisol secretion. In turn, lower cortisol  levels predict higher subsequent pain severity. Preliminary data suggest that prolonged HPA hypo-activity,  indexed by hair cortisol concentration (HCC), is associated with greater pain intensity and pain-related  disability. Despite theoretical models implicating HPA hypo-activity as a consequence of adversity and a risk  factor for chronic pain, no studies have investigated HPA function as a mechanism linking adversity to daily  pain in AA adults. Experimental pain responses correlate with pain intensity and predict risk for developing  pain. Adversity is associated with altered evoked pain sensitivity. In turn, experimental pain responses predict  daily and chronic pain. Although racial differences in experimental pain responses are well-established, no  studies have tested altered pain sensitivity as a mechanism linking adversity to pain in AA adults. We will  recruit 160 participants (~50% female), 18-45 years of age, without chronic pain, who self-identify as AA.  Assessments at baseline, 6- and 12 months will determine exposure to adversity (self-report, geocoded crime  report data), daily pain (intensity/disability), HCC (hair samples), and experimental pain facilitation and  inhibition. Anticipated findings will highlight two novel mechanistic pathways linking cumulative adversity, which  is more common in AA adults, to subsequent daily pain and disability. This proposal will also set the stage for  secondary prevention efforts aimed at eliminating racial disparities in chronic pain by identifying HPA hypo-  activity and evoked pain sensitivity as early risk markers for screening and potential targets for intervention."

"9377441","The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents entry of most drug molecules into the brain, an obstacle which adds time and cost to the discovery and development of central nervous system (CNS) drugs. The BBB possesses transporter proteins that allow biological molecules including amino acids, glucose, and hormones to cross as needed. One of these transporter proteins, the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT-1) transports specific amino acids (e.g. phenylalanine) as well as compounds that resemble them (e.g. the drug L-DOPA). This transporter offers a potential route for targeted drug delivery to the brain; moreover, it has been demonstrated that drugs chemically linked to amino acids can cross the BBB via LAT-1. It is known that some molecules are transported (substrates), while others only bind to the transporter surface (inhibitors); however, the structural requirements for either type of activity is poorly understood. We propose mapping the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for molecules that interact with LAT-1 with the aspiration of making this transporter a practical and widely used vehicle for drug delivery. Our approach involves using a computational model of the LAT-1 binding site to guide the synthesis of compounds similar in structure to natural amino acids but with unique chemical properties that could be used to design improved drug delivery agents. Our specific aims are three-fold. First, we will synthesize amino acids chemically substituted with groups that our model predicts will form beneficial interactions with the transporter. Second, we will use cell-based assays to test these compounds. To determine whether they are transported, we will use cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation cell assays which have successfully identified previously unknown substrates. SAR from these experiments will be used to refine our computational model in order to generate hypotheses to guide further substrate optimization. The intracellular concentration of selected compounds will be analyzed by LC-MS/MS to verify our hypothesis that LAT-1 activity increases cell uptake. A third aim of this project will involve the synthesis and testing of amino acid prodrugs of a topoisomerase I inhibitor for cancer (SN-38) to assess whether the SAR derived from optimization of LAT-1 substrates in specific aims 1 and 2 can be applied to improve prodrug cellular uptake. Additionally, the effect of the linker joining SN-38 and the amino acid promoiety, which may have a significant impact on prodrug pharmacokinetics and efficacy, will be examined. This project has broad applications for treating many different diseases both in the brain and other tissues where LAT-1 is heavily expressed, including cancer."
"9525545","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The control of gene expression in mammals relies in part on modifications to cytosine residues in DNA, which exist in at least five forms: cytosine (C), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5- formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). DNA methyltransferases methylate cytosine at the 5- position in the context of CpG dinucleotides, generating 5mC in the genome. Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases convert 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC in three consecutive oxidation reactions. These modifications are dynamically regulated during embryonic development and enriched in brain. To understand the function of these modifications and the regulatory mechanisms that control the levels and genomic distribution of the five forms of the cytosine, we propose to study the enzymes/proteins that generate, read, and remove these modifications. Specifically, the three aims of this proposal are to determine central aspects, enzymatically and structurally, of (1) 5mC oxidation by Tet proteins, (2) modification-specific recognition by C2H2 zinc-finger and SRA-domain proteins, and (3) 5mC and 5hmC base excision by DNA glycosylases."

"9383991","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bile flow is essential for normal liver function. Cholestasis is the term for all phenomena where bile flow is impaired. Over the last few years, great progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pediatric cholestatic liver disease, including by the current applicants. Despite this, in 40% of children, the primary genetic etiology of cholestasis has not been identified, after targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) of known cholestasis genes. Furthermore, our understanding of these diseases, and our ability to treat them, is still limited. This proposal continues the collaboration between Drs. Bull and Thompson. It brings together the unmatched sample and data resources of the 2 largest pediatric liver centers in Europe (King's College London and Children's Memorial Institute in Warsaw), Dr Bull's laboratory, and the NIH-funded Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN). This collection of resources and experience will enable the following challenges to be addressed. In Aim 1, genetic studies will be performed to identify novel cholestasis genes, and novel mutations in known cholestasis genes. This aim will be accomplished using state-of-the-art genetic technologies including: tNGS, whole exome sequence (WES), whole genome sequencing, RNA-sequencing and methylation analysis. In Aim 2, we will characterize the features of genetically distinct forms of cholestasis, through assessment of clinical and biochemical data from patients. Extensive tissue collections are available and histological and immunohistochemical analysis will be undertaken. In Aim 3, we will investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying genetic cholestasis. Animal models of known genetic forms of cholestasis typically fail to replicate human phenotypes well, so in vitro model systems are required to investigate disease mechanisms and test potential treatments. In vitro systems may be used to assess promoter function, splicing, trafficking and membrane transport, as appropriate. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9 technology will be used to introduce homozygous mutations into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to generate mutated hepatocyte and cholangiocyte-like cells. These cells will be used to explore the consequences of mutations in disease-causing genes, initially focused on increased understanding of disease mechanism in TJP2 deficiency. Preliminary data have shown these cells form canaliculi with tight junctions between cells. Use of such cells will allow us, for example, to test the permeability of tight junctions in vitro. In conclusion, these proposed studies will result in identification of new disease genes and mutations, illuminate the commonalities and differences between different genetic forms of cholestasis, and shed light on basic physiology and disease mechanisms. These aims fulfill key goals of ChiLDReN and are central to the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), as stated in its Action Plan for Liver Disease Research."
"9447811","Abstract Autism spectrum disorders are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Identification of convergent molecular pathways and neural circuits underlying autism endophenotypes are crucial to discovery of novel drug targets for development of effective therapies. Glutamate mediates the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS. Glutamate receptor interacting proteins 1/2 (GRIP1/2) are neuron-enriched scaffolding proteins with 7 PDZ domains. PDZ domains 4-6 of GRIP1/2 bind the c-terminal domain of AMPA receptor 2/3 (GluA2/3). Loss of Grip1/2 expression in mice results in delayed recycling of GluA2 in neurons and increased sociability and social interactions. Studies of AMPA-signaling proteins identified an enhanced GluA2-S880 phosphorylation in prefrontal cortex in the mutant mice. In a screen of glutamate signaling genes in patients with autism, we found gain-of-function mutations in GRIP1-PDZ4-6 that contribute to reduced social interactions in autism patients. To study mechanisms of GluA2 trafficking in modulating social behaviors, we generated knock-in mice carrying a human autism-associated mutation I586L. Grip1-I586L mice show increased binding with GluA2 in brain lysates and exhibit a reduced sociability in the modified three-chamber sociability tests. We hypothesize that Grip1-I586L alter GluA2 recycling and surface expression resulting in increased AMPA synaptic strength and enhanced local connectivity in prefrontal cortex. We will study molecular mechanisms responsible for GluA2 trafficking defects in Grip1-KO and Grip1-I586L mice. We will investigate neural mechanisms of disturbance of AMPA signaling in prefrontal cortex causing social behavioral deficits in autism using electrophysiology and optogenetic methods. The results shall provide valuable insights into neural mechanisms of AMPA signaling defects in social behavioral deficits in autism."
"9380237","ABSTRACT Changes in the position and orientation of a patient?s anatomical features during radiotherapy, if not properly managed, can lead to underdosage of the target and/or overdosage of neighboring healthy tissues. Deformable image registration (DIR), owing to its ability to geometrically align two images, is becoming increasingly important in radiotherapy for managing these anatomy variations. The accuracy of the DIR directly impacts the success of its clinical applications. Careful assessment of DIR algorithms is therefore a critical necessity before they may be used to inform clinical decision making. Current methods of DIR assessment focus on morphological structures but not on the physiological validity of the entire deformation. Recently, we have demonstrated a novel hyperpolarized 3He tagging MRI technique that is capable of directly, in vivo, and non-invasively measuring physiological lung deformation on a regional basis. This unique imaging technique holds great promise for assessing, validating, and improving the use of DIR algorithms in the lung. Our long term goal is to apply hyperpolarized gas tagging MRI to study lung biomechanics, develop more physiologically sound DIR algorithms for the lungs, and eventually improve radiotherapy of lung cancer. The overall objective of this application is to optimize the hyperpolarized 3He tagging MRI technology and establish its usefulness for DIR assessment. Aim 1 is to develop and optimize a methodology based on 3D hyperpolarized 3He tagging MRI for directly measuring lung deformation. Aim 2 is to develop physiologically sound digital thorax phantoms based on HP 3He tagging MRI and demonstrate their use for DIR assessment in the lung. Successful completion of these aims will yield a novel methodology based on hyperpolarized 3He tagging MRI for DIR assessment in the lung for radiotherapy. It will also yield a number of novel MR imaging techniques and a new series of digital thorax phantoms. The ability to measure true physiological lung deformation makes our technique a promising tool for the assessment, validation, and improvement of lung DIR algorithms. This study will bring important changes to research and the clinic. In the short term, it may lend new insights into the complexities of pulmonary biomechanics, enrich our understanding of DIR, generate gold-standard datasets of lung deformation that may benefit the research community, and provide guidance for clinical implementation of DIR. In the long term, it may lead to development of more sophisticated DIR tools for improving radiotherapy of lung cancer, resulting in more precisely delivered radiation treatment to lung tumors and mitigating radiation- induced injury to surrounding normal tissues."
"9552412","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching aims of this Center are to help advance the clinical, research, and educational goals of the ChiLDREN grant with a particular emphasis on engaging cutting-edge genome studies as a basis for discovery, innovation, and improvements in outcomes and care. As such, the aims of this application are not only to provide comprehensive research opportunities for all children who fit enrollment criteria for ChiLDREN throughout the Southeastern US. We are also planning to embark upon 3 genomically-centered Research Aims: Aim 1: Explore the genetic determinants of outcomes in biliary atresia (BA). We hypothesize that by detailed, broad-based, unbiased exploration of individual patient genomic determinants (e.g., whole exome sequencing), we will be able to assign genetic categorization of children into those able to adapt well post-Hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE), and those who do not. Intial findings have identified variants in a pathophysiologically-relevant gene that associate with poor outcome after HPE. Aim 2: Determine causes of BA with Laterality Defects. This will proceed by identifying carefully-phenotyped individuals with biliary atresia with laterality defects. To date, 20 trios have been exome sequenced, and analyses are ongoing, with expectations to validate such findings in the larger, BA cohort in ChiLDREN. Aim 3: Explore GGT as a marker for development and progression of portal hypertension in BA subjects with native livers over the age of 2. Preliminary data support the concept that an elevated GGT at age 2 predicts the development of portal hypertension indices and we will utilize the ChiLDREN database to validate and fine- tune these findings, with the goal being to develop GGT as a biomarker of disease progression in BA. The latter will have relevance for a planned study of a novel FXR agonist in these older BA patients in this consortium. The final proposal is to make a single-site exome sequencing and bioinformatics locale within the Emory Genetics Lab under the guidance of Dr. Madhuri Hegde, with close interweaving of longitudinal information from the DCC to develop models, stratify patients, and predict outcomes. Taken together, the focus upon exome sequencing in this population of diseases that manifest early in life and can be stratified into readily-identifible outcome groups, are arguably the ideal group of patients ever collected to deliver etiologic and therapeutic discoveries in cholestasis. For these serious pediatric liver diseases, none with effective medical therapies, studies like these will not only benefit this population, but are likey to provide a deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying liver disease progression in patients of all ages."
"9395237","(7) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Of the millions of women sexually assaulted each year, the vast majority (82%) report being intoxicated at the time of the assault, as are roughly half of all perpetrators (Abbey et al., 2014; Krebs et al., 2015). Frequent heavy and binge drinking are consistently associated with sexual assault victimization (Mouilso & Fischer, 2012) and perpetration (Abbey et al., 2012). Sexual assault has numerous negative consequences, including both physical (e.g., vaginal trauma; unwanted pregnancy; sexually transmitted infection) and psychological problems (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder; substance abuse; suicide; e.g., RAINN, 2016; WHO, 2012). Thus, understanding the role of alcohol in sexual assault is a vital public health priority. In particular, research is needed that characterizes the proximal mediators and moderators of alcohol's acute effects on decision-making processes related to sexual assault risk. The proposed two-year research project will test sex differences in effects of alcohol on two key risk-related processes, namely, judgments of and objective responses to women's displays of sexual interest (or lack thereof), and perceptions of the risk for sexual assault during interactions between a young man and woman who have been drinking. The proposed research also will evaluate the extent to which key individual difference variables (e.g., sociosexual attitudes; alcohol sensitivity; trait aggressiveness) moderate alcohol's acute effects on these processes. Over two years, one hundred young men and women (ages 21-30) will be recruited to participate in a two-session alcohol challenge experiment, during which they will be asked to judge the sexual interest (SI) of female targets in photographs and to assess the risk for sexual assault in video vignettes (risk perception; RP) both sober and following a relatively large (Males: ~0.85 g/kg; Females; ~0.75 g/kg) dose of alcohol. During these tasks, video recordings of participants' facial emotion displays and recordings of participants' skin conductance will be passively obtained. Aim 1 of the proposed research is to characterize alcohol's effects on men's and women's judgments of female targets' SI, as well as potential moderation of these effects by sociosexual attitudes. Aim 2 of the proposed research is to characterize effects of alcohol on men's and women's subjective and objective RP and the extent to which individual differences in alcohol sensitivity (i.e., the number of drinks required to experience subjective effects of alcohol) moderates these effects. Data bearing on these aims will greatly extend knowledge concerning the sex-specific decision-making processes that previous research has suggested are proximal causes of sexual assault and that are believed to be impaired by alcohol. By extension, the proposed research will have implications for the design of prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing sexual assault, particularly the large majority of cases involving alcohol intoxication."

"9551164","OVERALL: PROJECT ABSTRACT Although children comprise one-quarter of the US population, only 10% of ClinicalTrials.gov registered studies focus on child health-related clinical and translational research (CTR). The mission of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at Children's National (CTSI-CN) is to address the barriers and serve as a hub within the CTSA Network that is focused on the promotion of child health CTR. Established in 2010, the inaugural CTSI-CN (CTSI-CN v1.0) was organized as a collaboration between Children's National Health System (CNHS) and its academic partner, The George Washington University (GW). Over the past four years, CTSI-CN v1.0 has positioned itself as an effective catalyst for child-health CTR around four major themes: 1) improving the health of children and their families; 2) developing novel treatment strategies for rare genetic diseases; 3) designing new devices for pediatric care; and 4) characterizing childhood precursors of disease along the lifespan. We have embraced many of the tenets recommended in the July 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, specifically, developing multidisciplinary teams, providing cost-effective services and support for investigators, and streamlining processes that impact the effective conduct of CTR. The CTSI-CN is acknowledged locally as the hub for effective, high quality child health CTR and as a nurturing, integrated home for CTR team science. Nationally, the CTSI-CN has provided leadership in child health CTR, in both CTSA- and non-CTSA-linked consortia and steering committees. In the current proposal (CTSI-CN v2.0), we will continue to advance our vision and mission through innovative approaches and enhanced capabilities in our strategic themes. To this end, we have expanded our partnership to include Virginia Tech (VT) and its clinical partner, the Carilion Clinic. The goals of CTSI-CN v2.0, which will build on our established strengths, the lessons learned in CTSI-CN v1.0, and our new partnership with VT/Carilion (VTC), will also address the four NCATS strategic themes by: 1) developing a new generation of diverse, high quality child health-focused CTR investigators through innovative, inter-institutional educational, training, and mentoring programs (WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT); 2) creating innovative approaches and technologies to catalyze CTR, particularly in child-health, through novel cross-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations with multiple stakeholder communities (COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENT); 3) catalyzing the development, dissemination and evaluation of novel methods to enhance translational science, with a particular emphasis on the child-health CTR spectrum (METHODS AND PROCESSES); 4) enhancing quality and efficiency across the translational spectrum through a) the integration of a high quality diverse workforce, b) implementation of new methods and processes, and c) collaboration among the institutional partners and communities (INTEGRATION): and 5) providing leadership within the CTSA Network through multi-site collaborations and educational programs, with a particular emphasis on child-health CTR and outcomes (CTSA NETWORK)."

(3) To create a nationally accessible  institute for educating and mentoring researchers, clinicians and developers in biomedical innovation and  entrepreneurism. The Center will provide experience-based training to cultivate a growing cadre of  commercially successful innovators. Generation of the CCIA will thus create a self-sustainable engine for  propelling a large pipeline of NHLBI-related research discoveries into advances in human health."
"9376083","Project summary  DNA analogs that contain latently reactive electrophilic functionalities can selectively form covalent bonds with target biomolecules such as DNA, mRNA, and protein through affinity induced reactions. Therefore, they can be used as probes in research areas such as chemical biology, and have the potential to become a new class of therapeutic agents that have advantages over drugs based on small organic molecules, peptides and DNA analogs that lack such functionalities. In addition, DNA derivatives that contain base-labile and electrophilic groups have been found in cells. They are intermediates of important cellular processes and may play important cellular functions. To study these processes and functions, the availability of the derivatives can be crucial for success. Consequently, chemical synthesis of base-labile and electrophilic DNA analogs is important in health related research. Traditional DNA synthesis technologies use strongly basic and nucleophilic reagents, which are not compatible with base-labile and electrophilic groups, are not suitable for the purpose. A few reported methods intended to solve the problem have serious drawbacks including contamination of product by toxic transition metal, high cost of excessively used precious metal, damage of DNA by UV light, complicated post-DNA synthesis procedure, and narrow applications. The objective of this project is to develop a universally useful technology for the synthesis of DNA analogs that contain a wide range of base-labile and electrophilic functionalities. To achieve the objective, protecting groups and linkers based on the 1,3-dithian-2-yl-methoxy organic function will be employed during DNA synthesis. With these groups and linkers, the technology does not require using any strong base, nucleophile, transition metal, and UV light in the entire process. The technology does not need any tedious and complicated post-DNA synthesis manipulations either. As a result, it will be practically useful for the synthesis of DNA analogs containing base-labile and electrophilic groups. In the previous funding period, we have proven that the objective is achievable by synthesizing natural DNA under non-nucleophilic conditions. In the next funding period, our specific aims include evaluating the scope of the technology for the synthesis of DNA analogs that contain different electrophilic groups and further advancing the technology to a new level so that it is more convenient to use and potentially has broader substrate scope. We will also study the protecting groups invented in this project in the context of small molecule synthesis. Our long-term goal is to develop a new generation of antisense drugs based on latently reactive electrophilic DNA analogs. Successful completion of this project will build the foundation for us to achieve the goal. The PI believes that cultivating next generation biomedical researchers is equally important as meritorious research. This project will help the PI to train one postdoc, at least one PhD student and about seven undergraduate researchers in nucleic acid chemistry. They will learn techniques including organic synthesis, automated DNA synthesis, and more. With this project, undergraduate students majoring in our pharmaceutical chemistry, biochemistry & molecular biology, and other programs will have a chance to participate in NIH-supported research, which will enhance their interest and qualification in pursuing a career in biomedical field."
"9350444","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A breakthrough lightweight, compact 3T MR scanner has been demonstrated to have gradient performance of 700 T/m/s slew rate, operating at 80 mT/m amplitude), which is a slew rate that is 3.5x faster than whole-body MRIs. The proposed next phase of the program will deliver key neuroimaging tools through a multi-disciplinary collaboration between Mayo Clinic and GE Global Research. This proposed work includes further technical development in image reconstruction, systems artifact correction, and pulse sequence programming that exploits the unique, high-performance capabilities of the compact 3T.  The Specific Aims of the project are to:   Aim 1) Develop Core Technologies for Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) on the Compact 3T   Aim 2) Develop New MRI-based Connectomics   Aim 3) Develop High-Resolution MR Elastography (MRE) Brain Stiffness Measurement  Aim 1 focuses on improving EPI on the compact 3T system to maximally capitalize on its unique gradient slew rate and specific absorption rate (SAR) advantages. Specific tasks related to this aim include: the development of model-based reconstructions, real-time system compensation to eliminate concomitant field artifacts, pulse sequence development for segmented EPI for very fast anatomical imaging, and improved efficiency for simultaneous multislice (SMS) by exploiting the SAR advantages.  Aim 2 exploits the compact 3T's dramatically reduced susceptibility artifacts in the region of the medial temporal lobe to enable task-free fMRI spontaneous coactiviation studies of the entire brain, including the hippocampus, which is central to the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Aim 3 describes how the compact 3T's high-performance gradients enable, for the first time, 3D gradient echo-based MR elastography (3DMRE). This will enable an 8x reduction in the acquired voxel size compared with the 2DMRE currently acquired with our whole-body MRIs. This has important applications, not-only to pre-surgical planning for tumor resection, but also to potentially develop new biomarkers for the study of neurodenegerative disease, such as AD. The new 3DMRE technique will be studied in the same patient cohort as Aim 2. We believe vastly improved spatial resolution and scan efficiency on the compact 3T MR platform will enable new clinical and neuroscience applications for assessing brain disease management, including traumatic brain injury, tumor treatment planning, and neurodegenerative diseases."
"9427686","Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by a variety of factors that result in brain damage and permanently impair motor control, marked by muscle stiffness and spasticity. Despite the seriousness and prevalence (1 in every 400 births), there have been few advancements in therapeutics in recent decades, with most treatments focusing on symptoms after they emerge rather than prevention and reduction of damage. This may be due to the historic lack of an animal model that displays a prominent CP-like phenotype in which it is possible to study the specific mechanisms giving rise to motor impairments. In this project, we propose parallel longitudinal studies in children with CP and in a new, clinically relevant animal model of CP. Rabbits subjected to prenatal hypoxia- ischemia (HI) show clear motor symptoms of spasticity associated with CP, most notably muscle stiffness in the limbs, hypertonia and hyperreflexia. Our main goal is to exploit this animal model to directly investigate perturbations in the normal development of spinal neurons and neuronal circuits, while relating cellular changes to motor behavior in both children and young rabbits with and without CP and HI injuries. While damage to the brain and corticospinal tracts have been the focus of much previous research, aberrant development of spinal circuits in CP provides a more accessible target for treatment and therapy of motor dysfunction. After injuries that can cause CP, we know from previous studies in both rabbit and rodent models that 1) there is altered expression of the Cl- transporter, KCC2 in the brain, and 2) spinal levels of serotonin are increased. Both of these factors are tightly developmentally regulated, and could directly promote sustained MN activity when unregulated: 1) with increasing KCC2 expression during development, inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord switch from a depolarizing to a hyperpolarizing postsynaptic effect; and 2) development of persistent inward currents (PICs) may alter intrinsic excitability of motoneurons (MNs). PICs increase neuronal excitability and sustain firing, but synaptic inhibition is very effective at turning them off. Hence, with loss of appropriate KCC2 expression, PICs are poised to exert an even greater influence on MN behavior. Our overarching hypothesis is that injuries causing cerebral palsy alter the development of spinal excitability in both children and an animal model, including progressive changes in MN PICs and KCC2 expression, in addition to the damage caused to the brain and the descending projections. Along with the well-documented loss of descending inhibitory tone, enhanced excitability in spinal MNs and reduced efficacy of spinal inhibitory synapses could contribute to hypertonia and spasticity of patients with cerebral palsy and these properties could be targeted for treatment."
"9422403","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Navigating the social world requires people to predict others' actions. This poses a significant challenge be- cause people cannot directly observe some of the best predictors of action: others' internal mental states. In- dividuals who can leverage information about these hidden causes of actions?by representing mental states?can better predict those actions and more successfully navigate the social world. How do people (i) represent the richness and complexity of others' invisible mental states, and (ii) use those representations to make social predictions? We propose that people reduce the complexity of others' minds by attending to the location of their mental states on a few key dimensions in a mental state ?map.? We have previously used rep- resentational similarity analyses (RSA) on functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data to show that people indeed represent others' mental states using a simple, low-dimensional map. The structure of this map is defined by three dimensions?rationality, social impact, and valence. Understanding how people employ this map will provide key insights into how people predict others' actions. Aim 1: This proposal seeks to develop a compre- hensive framework of mental state representations by first characterizing the structure of the map of mental states. We will refine the structure by assessing how it adapts across new social contexts and modalities. We will measure two structural features of the map?size and shape?using novel RSA methods on fMRI data. Di- mensions that have universal social functions should hold a stable shape across all contexts and modalities; dimensions that have specific, or contextualized functions should deform across context or modality. The size of the space should expand to reflect the social relevance of the target. Understanding the structure of the men- tal state map lays the foundation for understanding how people represent others' mental states. Aim 2: We next explore how people leverage this map to make social predictions. We propose that the mental state map encodes not only the location of others' current mental state, but also where in the map they will likely move to Thus, people could make social predictions We will use fMRI, large-scale experience sampling studies, and computational modeling over behavioral data to establish that people indeed spontaneously model others' mental state dynamics, and moreover, that these models make accurate social predictions. In both aims, we will test how the structure and dynamic of mental state maps predict social functioning (or dysfunction). Using an individual differences ap- next. by modeling the dynamics of others' mental states as paths through this map. proach, we will link our novel measures of structure and dynamics to participants' performance on a battery of social cognition, social behavior, and social relationship measures. Taken together, this proposal uses innova- tive techniques (e.g., novel RSA methods, Markov modeling, and experience sampling) to develop a compre- hensive theory of mental state representations and social predictions. Understanding these basic building blocks of social cognition carries promising future directions for assessing and ameliorating social deficits."
"9427411","Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are the major cause of lower urinary tract obstruction in male children and account for 17% of pediatric end-stage renal disease. Despite the severity of the disease and its impact on mortality and morbidity, the molecular basis of this condition is largely unknown, resulting in suboptimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The epidemiology of the disease, characterized by high selective pressure versus a phenotype with low fitness, suggests that dominant de novo mutations or recessive inheritance play a major role in disease determination. This proposal represents the natural continuation of a Pilot project from our O'Brien Center of Urology and aims at the identification of the genetic susceptibility factors for posterior urethral valves (PUV). Our central hypothesis is that rare variants with large effect size on the phenotype underlie the genetic architecture of PUV, and that combining high-throughput genomic studies with analysis of two mouse models of disease will lead to the identification of novel disease genes. Our preliminary data using exome and geneome sequencing, CNV analysis, and functional modeling in vertebrate strongly indicate that we can successfully identify novel genomic variants with large effect size, even in scenario of complex genetic architecture and high genetic heterogeneity. In particular, by studying CNVs in a large cohort of PUV patient, we identified different novel candidate genes for PUV and lower urinary tract malformation. We next demonstrated that mouse transcript dosage of one of these gene candidates, Tbx6, results in highly penetrant maldevelopment and lack of canalization of urethra similar to human PUV. Simultaneously, we have identified a set of genes that are disregulated in mouse mutants lacking Sall1, a transcription factor that when mutated in humans causes Townes-Brocks Syndrome (TBS), a clinical entity characterized by different malformations, including anorectal defects, PUV, and hypospadias. We now propose to extend our sequencing effort to additional 200 PUV trios, and to replicate findings in a large cohort of patients to identify novel genes. We will also characterize the lower urinary tract defects of Sall1 and Tbx6 and generate whole transcriptome datasets to identify downstream targets and facilitate gene identification in humans. This study is designed to solve the molecular etiology of PUV, to improve diagnosis and individualized care for children affected by this severe condition, and to identify pathways that can be amenable to therapeutic interventions."
"9517140","PROJECT SUMMARY Although the health benefits of physical activity in prevention and mitigation of many chronic diseases have been documented for decades, the molecular mechanisms mediating these health benefits are still poorly understood. To understand the adaptive response of physical activity at the molecular level, it is essential to comprehensively characterize the dynamic changes in protein expression and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in tissues and circulating biofluids. The overall objective of the PNNL Proteomics Chemical Analysis Center for MoTrPAC (ProMoTr) is to support the consortium by providing comprehensive discovery and subsequent targeted verification analyses of circulating protein factors in blood and associated PTMs in multiple tissue types collected by the Pre-clinical Animal Study Sites and Clinical Centers of MoTrPAC. To develop a `molecular map' of transducers that provide the impacts of physical activity in humans, the ProMoTr's integrative proteomics analysis plan has two major foci. First, we will focus on the circulating secreted factors found in blood plasma and tissues based on the known cross-talk between and within tissues resulting from physical activity. Second, we will investigate the tissue- and cellular- level response to physical activity by assessing intracellular signaling as mediated by protein PTMs, including protein phosphorylation, reversible redox modifications, and lysine acetylation and acylation. The Specific Aims of ProMoTr are: 1) to provide the Proteomics Chemical Analysis Element to discover and verify circulating factors and intracellular molecular transducers; 2) to provide the Bioinformatics Element to fully support the needs of ProMoTr in statistical design, data processing, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination; 3) to provide the Administrative Element to oversee internal activities and to provide high-level collaborative interactions with MoTrPAC centers and the broader consortium. The feasibility of performing high quality reproducible discovery and verification analyses on the scale of tens of thousands of tissue samples is built upon PNNL's record of accomplishment of large-scale integrative proteomics programs. The PNNL foundation includes refined quality control, large-scale computation, and dissemination capabilities, our recognized expertise in the development and deployment of cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based technologies, and our capabilities for studying protein PTMs that are closely linked with energy metabolism."
"9484511","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health disparities are a significant problem in Arkansas, arguing for research to eliminate them. The development and support of researchers and communities who can conduct research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these disparities and test the effectiveness of strategies to achieve health equity is essential. We will continue to complete research in minority health disparities, promote the training of a diverse research workforce, disseminate research findings, and foster collaborations and partnerships through the activities of the proposed Arkansas Center for Health Disparities (ARCHD). The proposed Center builds on 9.5 years of strong, collaborative work as an Exploratory Center of Excellence, continuing its thematic focus developing multidisciplinary, multilevel research that reduces chronic disease risk factors for which there are significant health disparities among socially disadvantaged African American communities, with a goal of improving health and quality of life and ultimately eliminating health disparities. ARCHD will maintain three core units ? an Administrative Core to provide overall coordination and management of Center activities, including the coordination of common data elements, evaluation, and methods expertise; an Investigator Development Core, to develop a pilot project program for early stage investigators and to provide mentorship and guidance; and a Community Engagement and Dissemination Core, to expand and facilitate equitable, sustainable, collaborative relationships with community and other stakeholders and to coordinate dissemination of research findings to diverse audience segments. The Center will implement two full research projects, both using a community health worker model to deliver interventions to disadvantaged African American populations, i.e., female African American tobacco users in rural communities and recently incarcerated African Americans at high risk of contracting HIV. We seek to foster additional research addressing minority health disparities, both within and outside the Center, the dissemination of which may inform efforts to create systematic change in policies, programs, and environments to reduce and eliminate health disparities."
"9512117","Prevention of cognitive decline and delay of onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are public health priorities, and improving brain health is a firm commitment of the National Institutes of Health. Since ambient air pollution exposures are pervasive and modifiable, they are an appropriate target for research on brain health. Evidence for air pollution links to neurodegeneration is accumulating with recent studies implicating fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), oxides of nitrogen (NOx and NO2) and traffic-related pollution in lower cognitive function, cognitive decline, incidence of AD and all-cause dementia, and brain atrophy. The effects of air pollutants on neuropathology in the aging brain are unknown. Deeper understanding of air pollutants as potential risk factors will lead to better characterization of disease mechanisms. Improvements in public health will follow since air pollution exposures can be modified by changes in regulations and individual behaviors. Few epidemiological studies have been well-positioned to overcome many of the inherent weaknesses in exposure assessment, study design, and outcome data availability, including a unique set of neuropathology measures, needed to advance our understanding of the role of time-varying air pollution exposures on cognitive health, AD, and aging. This study is a unique collaboration between leading experts in the fields of aging and AD research, statistical, and environmental health sciences. It will use a long-term prospective cohort study design to examine the effects of air pollution on cognitive decline, all-cause dementia and AD incidence, and brain neuropathologies. It leverages the community-based sample of 5,088 adults free of dementia at the time of enrollment from the NIA-funded Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. ACT is an outstanding resource representative of the community with prospective, long-term (up to 20 years), and high- quality cognitive follow-up, careful diagnosis of incident dementia by subtype, and outstanding data availability including 633 brain autopsies, genetic data, and decades of extensive medical, and residential history data extending decades prior to study enrollment. We will collect new air pollution measurements to develop for ACT participants state-of-the-art long-term average air pollution predictions for ambient PM2.5, O3, NOx, and NO2 of the highest quality to address our study hypotheses. Our overarching goal is to identify air pollution risk factors and quantify their effects in order to promote healthy aging. This study provides an extraordinary opportunity to advance our comprehensive understanding of the effects of air pollution exposures on cognition in the aging brain and on risk of AD. It aligns well with the 2012-2017 NIEHS Strategic Plan by advancing fundamental research using state-of-the-art exposure science."
"9551719","Our long term goal is to understand how the excess synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) results in chronic disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. TAG metabolism is directly linked to two markers of the metabolic syndrome: increased waist size (excess visceral fat stores) and dyslipidemia, particularly high serum TAG which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. To achieve our goal, we need to answer questions of how TAG synthesis is normally regulated, how the enzymes in the pathway of TAG synthesis contribute to hepatic fatty acid metabolism, and how lipid intermediates of the TAG pathway control hepatic pathologies. The initial and rate-limiting step in hepatic TAG synthesis is catalyzed by three independent glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) isoenzymes which appear to differ in their ability to target their lipid products towards specific downstream pathways, thereby altering the rate of TAG synthesis under differing physiological conditions, reducing the rate of fatty acid oxidation, adjusting the fatty acid composition of phospholipids, regulating nutrient-mediated signaling cascades, and blocking adipogenesis in human BSCL2 congenital lipodystrophy. Because the GPAT isoforms are intimately involved in processes involving the development of hepatic steatosis, VLDL biosynthesis, insulin resistance, and adipogenesis, we believe that identifying the independent functions and regulation of the GPAT isoforms will allow potential targeting of their pathogenic outcomes by identifying new targets and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of fatty liver, dyslipidemia, and the BSCL2 congenital lipodystrophy."
"9437497","Abstract Chronic kidney disease affects over 26 million Americans. For the one million patients with end stage renal disease, dialysis and kidney transplant are the only therapeutic options. However, dialysis is palliative and kidney donors are in short supply. Thus, there is a critical need for new therapeutic strategies. The basic unit of the kidney is the nephron, a highly vascularized filtration and recovery unit. In the nephron, the plasma filtrate generated in the glomerulus passes into the proximal tubule (PT). The PT is lined by cuboidal proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs), the major resorptive cell type of the nephron characterized by the polarized distribution of channels and transporters that recover essential molecules and ions from the plasma filtrate. In acute kidney injury, PTECs are highly susceptible to damage. Surviving PTECs can repair the injured nephron, but endogenous repair mechanisms are not well-understood. This slows the development of new therapeutic strategies to accelerate PT repair in both acute and chronic kidney disease. Recently, the McMahon lab identified that the transcription factor SOX9 is up-regulated in PTECs after acute kidney injury in mice. This SOX9+ population of PTECs repopulates the nephron and restores function. However, whether a similar mechanism underlies repair of the human PT is unclear. One of the only practical approaches to identify mechanisms of human PT regeneration is to study human PTECs cultured in vitro. However, conventional culture substrates are highly artificial and lack physical cues present in the native PT that impact PTEC phenotype and survival, such as fluid shear stress. As a result, PTECs in conventional 2-D culture lose polarity and functionality. Recently, ?Organ on Chip? approaches have been developed to expose PTECs in vitro to physical cues similar to those in vivo, such as fluid shear stress. PTECs cultured within these platforms form differentiated structures and have improved functionality. However, existing platforms require specialized equipment that is not accessible to most research groups, neglect to include supporting cell populations (such as endothelial cells), and have not been used as tools for identifying mechanisms of PT regeneration. Thus, in Aim 1, we will use off-the-shelf equipment to engineer a scalable platform for engineering and maintaining a human PT, leveraging the McCain lab?s experience in engineering ?Organ on Chip? models of striated muscle. Our key design parameters are to apply fluid shear stress to primary human PTECs cultured as a tubule within a protein-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel with relatively low elastic modulus. After validating that our engineered PT recapitulates key structural and functional phenotypes, we will add supporting cell populations (endothelial cells, fibroblasts) into the ECM hydrogel and establish any further improvements in PTEC viability, structure, and/or function. In Aim 2, we will induce global and local injury to our engineered PT and examine the expression of SOX9 throughout the PT during repair. We will then determine whether manipulating SOX9 activity can augment PT repair. This project is especially well-suited for the EBRG funding mechanism because we have established a multidisciplinary team (Prof. Megan McCain: junior investigator in biomedical engineering; Prof. McCain Andy McMahon: established investigator in kidney development) to develop a new engineered PT tissue platform to enable our hypothesis-driven research into SOX9-mediated mechanisms of human PT regeneration."
"9477326","MySTYLE: Online family-based HIV prevention for non-heterosexual Black adolescent males in the South In recent years, the highest rates of HIV in the U.S. have been concentrated among young men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those of color. Unfortunately, evidenced-based intervention programs for non- heterosexual Black adolescent males (nHBAM) do not exist. Drs. Brown and Crosby have each designed, tested (in the context of NIH-funded RCTs) behavioral interventions targeting young people at-risk of HIV acquisition. Also, their previous work demonstrates that parental involvement prevents sexual risk behavior by adolescents. They will adapt key elements of STYLE, an efficacious HIV prevention program for adolescents and their parents/caregivers, to be relevant for nHBAM. A formative phase will use in-depth interviews to assess and identify the needs of nHBAM and their parents/caregivers. Work groups, composed of youth, parents/caregivers, stakeholders, and investigators, will tailor and refine the content in an iterative process with a sophisticated media company (MEE studios). MySTYLE is proposed to be a series of eight online novella episodes designed to increase relevant knowledge, attitudes, and sexual protective behaviors of nHBAM. The project will take place in Jackson MS, which has the highest prevalence of HIV among urban MSM in the U.S. and the third highest rate among Black MSM under the age of 25. Adolescents and parents will be recruited from community organizations, medical clinics and schools. The feasibility and effect sizes of MySTYLE, compared to an attention-equivalent control group receiving general health information, will be tested with a cohort of 72 nHBAM and their parents. Interventions effect sizes will be determined for sexual behaviors, HIV testing, and psychosocial mediators (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, communication between adolescents and their parents/caregivers relative to sex, safer sex, and sexuality)."
"9466090","With the help of the National Cancer Institute, we at Ibex Biosciences, propose the following Phase 1 SBIR project to evaluate novel camelid (VHH) antibodies that target macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) for the treatment of solid tumors. MIF is known to play prominent roles in the development of cancer, and its expression in humans has shown to correlate with prostate cancer severity. Inhibition of MIF biologic activities using small molecule inhibitors or traditional antibodies may be found in the literature. However, there is only one anti-MIF candidate in the clinic. Additional approaches to anti-MIF treatments are therefore greatly needed. Use of a single chain antibody (VHH) for anti-MIF treatment offers many advantages over other therapeutic strategies, including increased stability and potential efficacy. We have therefore generated several anti-MIF VHH antibodies and produced preliminary data that warrant continued development efforts. The selected VHH have been demonstrated to bind MIF and preliminary cell-based assays show considerable anti-MIF. At Ibex Biosciences we wish to continue development of these anti-MIF VHH antibodies by establishing larger production levels of the VHH and test them in animal models. Our work will start with construction and expression of anti-MIF VHH and VHH-Fc antibodies. Succeeding feasibility work will focus on their characterization and demonstration of their functional antibody binding in cell line and animal models. While MIF has been demonstrated to play significant roles in many oncologic conditions, this evaluation will focus on prostate cancer for initial proof of concept. Subsequent development efforts will expand to other solid tumors such as pancreatic, lung, and others."

The CBP  consists of 51 Research Members, 14 Clinical Members, and 2 Adjunct Members. The membership spans 14  departments, and 2 centers, with two members from other institutions. The membership has $4.5 million in NCI  funded research support out of a total of $30.6 million in total research support. The CBP program is highly  productive with a total of 685 publications with 15% of the publications being intra-programmatic and 19%  inter-programmatic. The program has been subdivided into 4 interdependent themes: Computational Biology,  Functional Genomics, Cell Signaling, and Translation. The Computational Theme uses bioinformatic analyses  of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to identify clinically relevant pathways for the  development of therapeutic reagents or potential biomarkers to be moved to preclinical validation studies. The  Functional Genomics Theme uses genetically engineered mouse models and patient-derived xenograft  analysis to determine the significance of genetic alterations in human cancer as identified by the  Computational Biology Theme. The Cell Signaling Theme functions to conduct in vitro mechanistic analysis of  signaling pathways identified by the Computational and Functional Genomics Theme to determine how these  pathways regulate cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. The role of this group is to identify which  pathways are targets for biomarkers or therapeutic development. Finally, the Translational Theme consists of  clinical researchers and researchers involved in development of novel therapeutics. The goal of this Theme is  to facilitate the translation of the basic science findings of the CBP to the patient. This group aids CBP  researchers in determining how these findings can be translated to the development of therapies and  biomarkers for the treatment of cancer."
"9356674","Abstract  We have developed a promising leukemia vaccine in which patient derived AML cells are fused with  autologous dendritic cells (DCs), presenting a broad array of antigens that capture the heterogeneity of the  leukemia cell population. We are completing a phase II clinical trial in which patients that achieve remission  following chemotherapy undergo vaccination with DC/AML fusions. Remarkably, 71% of patients with a  median age of 63 remain in remission with a median of over four years of follow up. Vaccination was  associated with the dramatic expansion of T cells targeting both autologous AML cells and previously defined  leukemia associated antigens. We hypothesize that DC/AML vaccination post- allogeneic transplant would  elicit the durable expansion of leukemia specific T cells within the donor T cell repertoire to effectively protect  against disease relapse. We postulated that vaccine response would be enhanced during donor lymphopoietic  reconstitution due to the relative depletion of inhibitory cells and recovery of functionally competent donor cells.  Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have been shown to enhance immunogenicity of tumor cells via enhanced  antigen presentation. We have demonstrated that exposure to a second generation HMA is associated with  upregulation of antigen processing, increased expression of the PR1 leukemia associated antigen, decreased  expansion of MDSCs, and downregulation of PDL1 expression. DC/AML fusions express high levels of PDL-1  offering a counter-regulatory signal that blunts vaccine mediated T cell activation. Notably, antibody mediated  blockade of PDL1/PD1 has resulted in durable clinical responses in a subset of patients with advanced  malignancies. The efficacy of antibodies targeting the PD-1/PDL-1 pathway as single agents is most  pronounced in tumors characterized by a dense infiltrate of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In contrast, effective  immunotherapy for AML likely requires a strategy to expand leukemia specific lymphocytes and reverse tumor  mediated tolerance. Recent studies highlight the importance of additional checkpoint molecules including TIM3  and RGMb that act in concert with PD-1 to induce an exhausted phenotype in tumor reactive lymphocytes.  Combined immune checkpoint blockade has the potential to act synergistically to overcome tolerance and  enhance immune response to vaccination. In the present study, we will conduct a clinical trial in which AML  patients with high risk features who undergo allogeneic transplantation in remission will undergo post-  transplant vaccination with donor DC/AML fusions alone or in conjunction with HMA. The primary clinical  endpoint is to assess vaccine associated toxicity including the impact on incidence of GVHD. The secondary  clinical endpoint will be to examine the effect of vaccination on relapse-free survival. Immunologic response  following post-transplant vaccination alone or with HMA will be asssed. In a preclinical murine leukemia model,  we will assess the capacity of the second generation checkpoint inhibitors, RGMb and TIM3 alone and in  combination with PD-1 blockade to augment response to DC/AML fusion vaccine."

"9564399","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to establish a novel mechanism whereby microRNA (miRNA) miR-302/367 regulates neural tube closure (NTC). Disruption of NTC leads to neural tube defect (NTD), which is the second most common birth defect in humans affecting 1 to 1,000 births. However, the regulators and mechanisms that control NTC at post-transcriptional gene regulation levels remain largely unknown.  We have created the first miRNA mouse model of NTD. We found that depletion of miR-302/367 leads to NTD and embryonic lethality. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) exhibit reduced proliferation, premature differentiation, and decreased survival in the mutant embryos. Importantly, we have identified individual miRNA targets with potent roles in specific cellular behaviors that are affected in mutant embryos. In addition, we found that miR-302/367 is associated with an RNA binding protein Lin41 to regulate gene expression; depletion of Lin41 also leads to NTD. These preliminary data lead to a novel hypothesis that miR-302/367 interacts with Lin41 to coordinately control multiple neural precursor cell (NPC) behaviors by regulating different miRNA targets during neural tube closure (NTC).  In this project, we will determine miR-302/367 functions and their action mechanisms during neural tube closure. Three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Determine the developmental and cellular basis of neural tube defect (NTD) in miR-302/367 mutant mice; 2) Test whether individual genes that we have identified as targets of miR-302 mediate specific cellular behaviors during neural tube closure; 3) Test the hypothesis that miR-302 functions together with Lin41 to regulate gene expression and NPC behaviors during neural tube closure. Together, these studies will improve our understanding of genetic factors associated with NTD and provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying neural tube closure and neural tube defect (NTD)."
"9395272","PROJECT SUMMARY Secretory diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children resulting from the overstimulation of chloride (Cl-) channels in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) that leads to overwhelming fluid secretion and life- threatening dehydration. These Cl- channels are regulated by cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) and calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathways, but there are gaps in knowledge in how pathogens, such as rotavirus (RV), cause diarrhea through elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c). RV persistently activates stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) in infected cells, which in turn activates processes for extracellular Ca2+ entry at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions. Activated STIM1 causes formation of ER-PM junction protein complexes that regulate Ca2+ and cAMP signaling and potentially the activation of Ca2+- activated and cAMP-activated chloride channels. Understanding the identity and activation of Cl- channels in RV infection is significant for advancing scientific knowledge of fluid secretion in the GI tract as well as future development of anti-secretory therapies to treat infectious and functional diarrhea. Thus the objective of this research is to identify the Cl- channels activated during RV infection and the regulatory role of activated STIM1 in ER-PM junctional complexes in their activation. I hypothesize that persistent activation of STIM1 stimulates the activation of Ca2+- and cAMP-dependent Cl- channels for RV-induced diarrhea. Using human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) genetically modified with biosensors as a model of IECs and a mouse model of RV diarrhea, I propose [1] to identify the Cl- channels activated during RV infection and [2] to determine the dynamic composition of ER-PM junctions with STIM1 activation in RV-infected IECs. Results from the proposed project will significantly advance our current understanding of molecular mechanisms of Cl- secretion in IECs, which can be extended to study other enteric viruses and bacterial pathogens. These findings will provide new insights into the regulatory roles of ER-PM junctions in the specialization of cell functions."
"9435802","Abstract  An astonishing 86 million adults have prediabetes and are at high risk for joining the 29.1 million Americans who already have type 2 diabetes without appropriate intervention. These Americans who are at high risk will add to the staggering $245 billion in annual health care costs currently being spent on diabetes in the U.S. [1]. Efforts to translate evidence-based interventions to prevent or treat chronic disease have been identified; however, reach to high-risk populations has been limited. Reviews of dissemination and implementation studies have suggested the need for additional translational strategies and cultural adaptations are needed ?to increase program relevance, satisfaction, and participation? among high-risk populations. Historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) are typically situated within, educate, employ, and serve populations that are at high risk for chronic disease, and may be an important partner for disseminating interventions in high-risk communities. The proposed R21 project will evaluate the capacity for D&I of EBIs for chronic disease prevention and treatment in low-income, high-risk populations through HBCUs by addressing the following aims:  1. Conduct formative assessment to identify facilitators for and barriers to D&I of EBIs in low-income,  high-risk communities through HBCUs; 2. Adapt, pilot test, and evaluate a curriculum for training HBCU students to facilitate EBIs in low-income,  high-risk communities; and  3. Explore the feasibility for expanding our D&I model to other HBCUs and chronic disease outcomes.  The proposed research will be implemented with representatives from Winston-Salem State University (WSSU; an HBCU), Wake Forest School of Medicine, and residents from the surrounding low-income community. We will use the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) curriculum as an exemplar model for training because diabetes is prevalent in the community and our team already has experience with, and a curriculum for, training DPP facilitators. The facilitator curriculum will be adapted to be delivered as a college-level course with input from relevant HBCU and community stakeholders. The course will include general group leader training and experiential learning opportunities to practice curriculum delivery. We will adapt and pilot test the course with ~6 students in year 1. During year 2, we will conduct a larger evaluation of curriculum as a for- credit course with 30 students. Outcomes of interest, informed by the RE-AIM framework, are focused on process measures and program fidelity and include reach, implementation, effectiveness, adoption, and maintenance of the course into the WSSU curriculum. The proposed R21 will be used to plan for a larger randomized, controlled pragmatic trial to test whether the HBCU model is successful for preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes onset by achieving DPP goals in underserved groups."
"9561228","Project Summary/Abstract (Description): Protocol Review & Monitoring System  Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) has established a process by which Cancer Center Members undergo  internal peer review of the scientific merit and prioritization of proposed clinical trials and population science  protocols prior to Institutional Review Board review (i.e., Dartmouth's Committee for the Protection of Human  Subjects [CPHS]). These NCCC reviews are to confirm the scientific validity of the proposed study, to assess  the feasibility of the study in light of the availability of human subjects and current protocols relying on  enrollments from that same population, to assure the safety monitoring plan is appropriate and in accordance  with regulations, and to offer comments that could enhance either scientific merit or implementation logistics of  the planned study.  NCCC's Clinical Cancer Research Committee (CCRC) is a chartered multidisciplinary committee charged with  reviewing all non-NCI Cooperative group research protocols and amendments proposed to be opened by  Dartmouth Principal Investigators (PIs) for treatment of, and intervention for, cancer. Cancer prevention  studies, screening trials, behavioral studies, quality of life / survivorship studies, and interventional trials that  rely on collection of patient-reported outcomes that have not already undergone external peer review by NIH  and its funding agencies are reviewed by the CCRC Population Science Subcommittee (PSS). The CCRC has  the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research activities that fall within its  jurisdiction.  CCRC members are selected to represent the broad spectrum of oncology research. Cadre membership  includes representatives from medical oncology, hematology, surgical oncology, pediatric oncology, clinical  pharmacology, biostatistics, basic science research, population science, clinical research administration, and  patient advocacy. Other disciplines such as Radiation Oncology, Pathology and Immunology are represented  by members on an ad-hoc basis when a clinical trial features such components in its main objectives."
"9356791","Project 1 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unfortunately, there are few ?druggable? alterations in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Thus, exploration of therapeutic liabilities engendered by defects in homologous recombination (HR), the second most common aberration in ovarian cancer after TP53 mutation, has taken a dominant role. HR defects caused by germline and somatic BRCA1/2 aberrations, as well as aberrations in other pathway members, lead to synthetic lethality in combination with inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase?1 (PARP). However, crucial gaps in knowledge exist that hinder our long-term goal of optimal implementation of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) including: 1) the identification of patients most likely to benefit from PARPi (i.e., ?PARPness?) and 2) the development of rational combination therapies able to prevent or overcome resistance to PARPi. In our prior SPORE project, we developed and implemented DNA, RNA and protein assays designed to predict benefit from PARPi as well as identified new members of the HR pathway, providing approaches to expand the population of patients likely to benefit from PARPi. In this SPORE proposal, we will complete our ongoing multi-arm combination trial with PARPi and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors and implement a resensitization trial in PARP resistant patients of Wee1 inhibition compared to PARP plus Wee1i. Using these trials, based on strong preliminary data from cell line, PDX and animal models, we will refine the utility of biomarkers to predict response and resistance to PARPi in HGSOC. We will further develop the preclinical and clinical data to justify a series of rational combination trials in this SPORE. Our overarching hypothesis is that the identification of a ?PARPness? molecular profile will expand the utility of PARPi in HGSOC. As a corollary, optimal outcomes will only manifest by rational combination therapy with PARPi. Thus, we will perform a systematic analysis of cell lines, animal models and patient samples, combined with our combinatorial adaptive resistance therapy platform and ultra-deep shRNA and CRISPR/CAS screens to targetable molecules to systematically identify rational combinations with PARPi therapy. To accomplish our long term goals and to test our overarching hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify and refine biomarkers of benefit from PARPi in ovarian cancer and Specific Aim 2: To establish a preclinical framework to identify and prioritize rational combination therapies in ovarian cancer. The successful implementation of the proposed studies will contribute to: 1) development of personalized treatment of women with advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer based on molecular profiles, 2) an expanded definition of patients likely to benefit from PARP inhibitors, 3) identification of resistance mechanisms to PARP inhibitors, and 4) rational combination therapies that will increase the spectrum of patients likely to benefit and also prevent the emergence of resistance. Successful implementation of this project will not only improve clinical outcomes but will direct development of future clinical trials to advance the field."
"9339505","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Plasmodium vivax malaria contributes to a large burden of malaria morbidity owing to its widespread global distribution, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains and most importantly, infections with Pv cause severe clinical syndromes. Plasmodium vivax accounts for 12.4% of infections acquired in Africa and 70-90% of infections acquired in Asia and the Americas. More cases of Pv are now reported than any other malaria species for active duty or returning soldiers. Because of increasing drug resistance to Pv, lethal cases and replapsing behavior of Pv, development of Pv vaccine is a major priority of the Military Infectious Disease Research Program. One the leading Pv vaccine candidates is P. vivax Duffy binding protein region II (PvDBPII). This protein is expressed at the parasite's cellular surface and binds the host red cell's Duffy antigen (Fy) that facilitates erythrocyte invasion. Other human malaria such as P. falciparum, have several different Duffy Binding Protein-like genes that facilitate the use o alternative receptors for merozoite invasion, however the almost exclusive dependence of PvDBPII and Duffy antigen for Pv invasion of erythrocytes a critical weakness and makes the Pv DBP ligand an ideal target for vaccine development.  Substantial challenges remain for use PvDBPII as a vaccine, including its high degree of polymorphism, its weak immunogenicity and a lack of understanding as regards to the specific portion of the molecule engendering the strongest blocking or protective responses. This proposal builds on observations from our current project. First, we have identified a subset of individuals in endemic areas who acquire high titers of functional antibodies described above that block binding to multiple PvDBPII variants. Mapping of the functional human Abs to specific regions of PvDBPII may help to identify a strain-transcending vaccine. Second, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies generated in different animals that block binding of PvDBPII to Fy preferentially recognize a relatively conserved sub-domain of PvDBPII that could facilitate development of a vaccine. Third, we have shown that the major polymorphism in Fy (Fyb?Fya, Asp42Gly) is associated with both diminished binding of PvDBPII and a reduced risk of clinical Pv in humans. We found that both naturally acquired and artificially induced Abs directed to PvDBPII more effectively blocked its binding to Fya as compared to Fyb erythrocytes, indicating host Fy genotype may be important vaccine efficacy. Aim 1. To identify epitopes on PvDBPII recognized by strain-transcending neutralizing antibodies. Aim 2. To develop vaccine approaches to elicit strain-transcending blocking/invasion inhibitory antibodies to PvDBPII. Aim 3. To determine the role of the Duffy Fya as compared to Fyb phenotype in functional immune responses to PvDBPII in vitro and in vivo."
"9419234","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Incidence rates of skins cancers, including melanoma, and squamous and basal cell carcinoma are on the rise among Hispanic/Latinos (H/L). Primary and secondary prevention can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality due to these skin cancers. Inherited variation at the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) locus is a robust marker of skin cancer risk, and disease risk associated with MC1R variants is often stronger in individuals without traditional clinical risk phenotypes, for example individuals with dark hair color, scant freckles and who do not easily burn. To determine whether knowledge and feedback of MC1R genotype can play a role in the promotion of behaviors linked to risk reduction and early detection of skin cancers, we will randomized 400 H/L participants identified from general internal medicine clinics in Ponce, Puerto Rico and 400 H/L participants identified from family practice clinics in Tampa, Florida to receive mailed health education materials containing either i) generic information about skin cancer risk, risk reduction and early detection (control arm) or ii) precision genetic information about skin cancer risk, risk reduction and early detection anchored in results from MC1R genotyping (intervention arm). We hypothesize that individuals who carry high risk MC1R variants and who receive precision information containing their MC1R genotype information will show improvement in skin cancer risk reduction and early detection behaviors over the course of 9 months. Prevention and early detection behaviors will be measured at baseline and again at 3 and 9 months. Our main outcome measures of interest are number of hours spent in the midday sun (primary prevention outcome) and completion of a skin examination (secondary prevention outcome). We also will assess whether health beliefs, cancer-related distress and worry, knowledge, fatalism, or familism mediate behavior change. In an exploratory fashion, we also will assess the impact of receipt of MC1R genotype on changes in behaviors among children of study participants. Here we will focus on number of sunburns in children as our main outcome of interest. The results of this project will help inform whether genetic screening targeted to the general H/L population of can positively influence risk behaviors associated with skin cancer."
"9393914","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      (1) PURPOSE - The purpose of the project is to evaluate mechanisms and related treatment approaches in chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using a mouse model. The three goals of this project are: 1) To determine the effects of chronic TBI and PTSD on memory and fear extinction learning. 2) To examine the effects of chronic TBI and PTSD on neuroinflammation, DAI, glia reactivity and dendritic spine morphology in PFC, HIPP and BLA regions; to examine the relationship between brain and behavioral changes. 3) To examine the effects of valproate (VPA) on memory and fear extinction and neurobiological changes in chronic TBI/PTSD.     (2) BACKGROUND- (a) Scientific Rationale- TBI and PTSD have become the signature injuries from     OEF/OIF war zones. Focal and diffuse brain injury occurs in TBI and this damage contributes to the associated neurocognitive and behavioral deficits. This proposed study comprehensively examines the effects of combined TBI and PTSD on axonal injury, neuroinflammation, and dendritic plasticity. Based on the research literature, we hypothesize that pharmacological treatment with VPA will enhance fear extinction learning and spatial memory and promote neural restoration in models of TBI and PTSD. (b) How this Research will Advance Knowledge in Rehabilitation Research - By increasing our understanding of the mechanisms and sequelae of brain injury and co-existing fear conditioning in animal models, we can examine potential biomarkers and screen candidate treatment approaches for humans with TBI/PTSD. (c) Significance of the Research and How it Relates to RR&D Priority Areas - The research relates to the RR&D Priority Area of Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury. Using a model of chronic TBI and PTSD is of critical importance for understanding brain and behavioral mechanisms and for the development of effective treatments for veterans. (d) Direct Benefits and Quality of Services - This study examines the effects of TBI and PTSD that have been sustained by many OIF/OEF veterans and will examine biomarkers for these conditions that can be then tested in humans. After testing in this model, the clinically available agent VPA can be carefully developed in     studies for its pro-cognitive and fear extinction enhancing effects for veterans with TBI and/or PTSD.     (3) EXPECTED OUTCOMES OR PRODUCTS - The first outcome of this study is to demonstrate that FPI and coexisting fear conditioning (FC) in mice impair long-term memory and extinction learning; these effects are associated with reductions in dendritic morphology in PFC, HIPP, and BLA. The second outcome is to show that the cognitive and fear extinction impairments in the TBI/PTSD model are associated with axonal injury, glial reactivity, and neuroinflammation in PFC, HIPP and BLA. The third outcome is to demonstrate that VPA treatment reverses spatial memory and fear extinction deficits in this model and reduces these neurobiological changes at 6 and 12 months post-injury. Additionally, we will demonstrate that administration of VPA from injectable gelatin delivered to the FPI injury site enhances cognition and reverses neurobiological effects.     (4) METHODS AND RESEARCH PLAN - Male C57BL/6 mice are used because of their demonstrated utility in our FPI and FC model. Our FPI model uses a moderate level of percussive force to produce long-term brain injury. FPI mice will undergo cued FC procedures to produce a comorbid TBI/PTSD  model. Behavioral testing is performed in FPI/FC mice using Morris Water Maze memory testing and fear extinction procedures. Brains are harvested from mice to measure changes in PFC, HIPP, and BLA using quantitative immunohistochemistry for axonal injury (as measured by ?-APP), neuroinflammation (as measured by IL-6 and GFAP) and dendritic plasticity (Golgi-Cox staining). In our FPI/FC model, we will test the effects of parenteral treatment with VPA at two separate chronic time points at 6 and 12 months. We will also pilot an approach using a biomaterial matrix for direct and continuous VPA administration at the TBI injury site."

It will manage and support the Cores and the Research project to validate and norm an expanded NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIHTB+) focused on older adults, age 65-85 with normal cognition, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or early dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Additional measures will be evaluated for inclusion in the NIHTB to enhance its value in AD research. The Admin Core will establish and implement administrative, statistical and technical support structures to enable any needed measure modification and development, and insure the efficient collection, analysis and storage of data. Additionally, the Admin Core will facilitate and support the integration of ARMADA within the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; PI: Kukull). Our Admin Core is comprised of professionals highly experienced in the management of large networks of scientists devoted to developing, validating, and applying outcome measures, including the NIHTB and other adult assessments. The Admin faculty and staff are at present responsible for curating the current NIHTB under funding provided by the NIH-funded Patient Centered Assessment Resource (PCAR, see www.healthmeasures.net). We have broad experience in managing and coordinating multi-component research, maintaining fiscal accountability, handling intellectual property (IP) issues, participating in FDA initiatives, regulatory compliance, self-assessment and evaluation, and overall operational, meeting, and logistical planning. We propose to parlay this experience to insure the effective and efficient support of the ARMADA team.  The Admin Core will oversee legal and regulatory compliance, including data security, establishing and implementing mechanisms to protect IP, maintaining and documenting regulatory compliance, and preparing documentation to enable FDA approval of the extended NIHTB measures in clinical trials. The core will work collaboratively with the Technology Core and the Data and Statistical Analysis Core to monitor data security and backup across all ARMADA sites.  The Admin Core will train and provide resources to the sites to insure successful data collection, using standardized procedures and continuous site support, and offer in-person training in utilizing didactics, simulations/role playing, demonstrations with hands-on practice, reviews, feedback, and discussions. They will visit sites annually to certify that local data collection is appropriate and consistent across all of the sites and provide sites with continuous support for technological and operational issues as well as score interpretation. !"
"9438775","PROJECT SUMMARY Musculoskeletal injuries are a leading cause of disability and medical costs in the United States. Approximately half of these injuries involve tendons and ligaments. The lifelong dysfunction, pain, and increased risk of re- injury due to poor healing have motivated our long-term goal to regenerate new tendon from stem cells to restore function and quality of life. Typical stem cell-based approaches aim to promote quantity of extracellular matrix (ECM) content, with the assumption that ECM quantity correlates with mechanical properties. However, these approaches have yet to achieve functional tendons. This has led us to ask how tendon develops naturally in the embryo to inform a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based tendon regeneration approach.  Our studies in the chick embryo recently showed that lysyl oxidase (LOX)-mediated crosslinking correlates strongly with mechanical properties during tendon development, and that inhibition of LOX activity reduces crosslinking and elastic modulus despite continued increases in matrix content. Furthermore, LOX activity appears to be regulated by embryonic kicking (mechanical loading). Based on these exciting data, we hypothesize LOX is a critical regulator of developing tendon mechanical properties, and that developmentally informed manipulation of LOX activity can promote functional tendon regeneration with MSC. The hypothesis will be tested with the following three specific aims: 1) determine LOX expression patterns and role in embryonic tendon mechanical property development; 2) elucidate how mechanical loading regulates LOX during embryonic tendon development; 3) develop approaches to enhance engineered MSC-construct mechanical properties via LOX-mediated crosslinking.  The proposed work is innovative because our approach focuses on restoring ECM quality, rather than quantity, of the regenerating tendon matrix, and aims to inform this approach with embryonic development. Our novel strategy combines the chick embryo model with tissue engineering and bioreactor loading systems to investigate LOX and mechanical loading interactions in functional tendon development. Our long-term goal is to design developmentally inspired LOX-targeted therapies utilizing MSC to improve tendon mechanical properties."
"9419148","Pilot Research Project 1: A Phase 1b Trial of Oligomeric Procyanidin Complex in Combination with Metformin for Reduced AGE Levels in Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy RESEARCH SUMMARY Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are reactive metabolites produced as by-products of sugar metabolism and oxidative stress. An extensive literature links AGEs with the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and other chronic diseases. The U54 investigators have identified preferential accumulation of AGEs in prostate cancer (PCa) serum and tumor, compared with normal serum and prostate tissue. Furthermore, among PCa patients, AGE accumulation is higher in blacks with African ancestry (AAs) than in European Americans (EAs). As AGEs appear to promote cancer survival and growth, interventions to limit their accumulation may be viewed as potential cancer therapeutic agents. These agents may be attractive components of multi-faceted treatment regimens for populations with high prevalence of poor diet, low income, obesity, and lack of exercise. These are all lifestyle factors that are known to increase cancer burden, and are often prevalent in AAs. The study investigators propose to conduct a Phase Ib clinical trial of a combination of two potential agents to reduce AGE levels ? metformin and oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC). Each agent has been shown to reduce AGE levels in some patients with either diabetes mellitus (metformin) or cancer (OPC). Their combination may be more effective than either agent alone. The study will be co-led by Dr. Shanora Brown from South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Dr. Michael Lilly from the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC). As a Phase Ib study, the primary objective will be to define toxicity for the drug combination. However, all analyses will compare results in AA and EA participants. Aim 1 is to conduct a Phase Ib trial of a combination of metformin and OPC in PCa patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This aim will be led by Dr. Lilly (MUSC-HCC). Aim 2 is to perform correlative biochemical studies of inflammation and oxidative stress during the Phase Ib trial. This aim will be led by Dr. Brown (SCSU). No studies to date have investigated AGE effects on PCa treatment. The proposed study provides a novel, unifying mechanism to account for the poorer PCa response to ADT, and the higher PCa incidence, as well as poorer quality of life, in patients with obesity, oxidative stress, and hyperglycemia. This mechanistic model may also mediate cancer racial disparities in PCa outcomes."

"9356793","Project 3 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiogenesis is known to play a critical role in cancer growth and metastasis. Among the many potential targets, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been well recognized to play an important role in angiogenesis, and drugs targeting this pathway have been used against ovarian and other cancers. Clinical use of anti-VEGF therapy, however, has yielded only modest improvement in progression-free or overall survival of patients with ovarian cancer, likely due to adaptive changes in the tumor microenvironment. There remains an unmet need to develop methods to enhance efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy and block growth- promoting adaptive changes. The mechanisms of adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF treatment are largely unknown. Understanding the adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF treatment has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in ovarian cancer patients. Our preliminary findings suggest that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are substantially increased in the anti-VEGF therapy-resistant tumors and TAM depletion (with CSF1R inhibitor) can improve the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy; however, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. In this proposal, we will explore the mechanisms by which macrophages contribute to adaptive resistance to anti-VEGF treatment and test the efficacy of dual targeting of VEGF and TAMs/MDSCs. Our central hypothesis is that targeting TAMs in the microenvironment will reverse the immunophenotypical alterations induced by bevacizumab and improve clinical efficacy. We will conduct a novel, induction, randomized supplementation clinical study to assess the impact of adding a CSF1R inhibitor to identify and overcome these effects as measured by objective response and event-free survival. The proposed work is highly translational and has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in ovarian cancer patients."
"9455470","DESCRIPTION         This proposal, Aerobic Exercise and Cognitive Training in Older Adults, is resubmission for a Career Development Award- Level 2 with Dr. Joe R. Nocera as the Principal Investigator and a mentoring team of Drs. Bruce Crosson, Ron Shorr, Marco Pahor and Michael Marsiske. Dr. Nocera received his undergraduate degree (B.A., 2001) from the University of California, Los Angeles. He completed his graduate degrees in Kinesiology from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (M.S., 2004) and the University of Georgia (Ph.D., 2007). Following completion of his terminal degree, Dr. Nocera earned a post- doctoral fellowship under a National Institute of Health T32 training grant within the Department of Neurology at the University of Florida. Dr. Nocera then received a CDA-1 aimed at studying the effects aerobic exercise on executive language function in older adults. It was hypothesized, and demonstrated in the preliminary CDA-1 work, that the robust documented benefits of aerobic exercise on cognition could carry over to more specific executive language functions. Concurrently, the CDA-1 was designed to increase Dr. Nocera's understands of cognitive neuroscience thus bridges the gap between cognitive functions and Dr. Nocera's previous education emphasis of physical function in older adults. The general purpose of the career development in this CDA-2 application is to further and more substantially develop Dr. Nocera's understanding of cognitive neuroscience for the purpose of designing interventions aimed at improving function and quality of life in older veterans. Specific training components in the proposal include; skills in cognitive neuroscience with specific training in cognitive aging, measurement, neuroanatomy, and basic imaging approaches. Additionally, the proposal is designed to develop Dr. Nocera's skills in clinical/translational research necessary for high-quality clinical trials research. The purpose of the CDA-2 study will build on the CDA-1, which demonstrating an improvement in cognitive function via aerobic exercise, by adding a cognitive training component that will be done immediately following the aerobic exercise. It is hypothesized that the aerobic exercise will potentiate and increase the generalizability of the cognitive training. Importantly, this study wil focus on older veterans at-risk for mobility disability. This area is of particular importance for he VA system, considering a large percentage of veterans are entering old age and therefore likely to suffer from age-related cognitive decline and mobility disability. To address our research question 60 older veterans (age 65-89) will be randomized to one of two 12-week intervention groups: 1) Cognitive Training alone (CT) or 2) Aerobic Exercise + Cognitive Training (AE+CT). The aerobic exercise arm of the study will follow the same format shown to improve a broad range of executive functions in older adults in previous research as well as our CDA-1 pilot work. The cognitive training arm will consists of a popular commercially-available brain fitness program that has demonstrated specific cognitive improvements and high adherence. Ultimately, this investigation will substantially advance the development of treatments for cognitive impairment because these goals explore an intervention that may potentially have pervasive effects on patient quality of life from a cognitive as well as a physical standpoint. Concurrently, this proposal will provide Dr. Nocera with the skill necessary to grow into a successful, independent VA Research."
"9386952","Glaucoma is a leading health and social burden in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It affects Africans and those of African ancestry disproportionately compared to other populations globally. The African region has the highest incidence and prevalence of glaucoma and it is disproportionately affected by this irreversible form of blindness. Glaucoma causes an estimated 15% of blindness in SSA compared to 8% globally. Reported prevalence of glaucoma in population based studies within SSA ranges from approximately 5 to 9% over age 40 to as high as 20% in those over age 80. Despite the high prevalence of glaucoma in SSA, resources for treatment are extremely limited. Medical management of glaucoma is impractical and rarely successful in SSA. Lack of available medication, affordability, and non-adherence to prescribed therapy are major impediments to medical management. Trabeculectomy, a surgical treatment for glaucoma, has been recommended as the primary treatment in Africans but is a high cost alternative and suffers from poor acceptance. In one study, only 8% of Nigerian patients would consider surgery citing high cost, fear of surgery, and the fact that vision would not be improved, only stabilized. Laser trabeculoplasty offers many advantages over surgical treatment. It is effective in many patients, requires modest skill levels to perform, has a high safety profile, and can be provided efficiently and at low cost. Studies in SSA, although relatively small in scale, suggest that laser trabeculoplasty is an effective, well tolerated, and accepted treatment alternative in SSA and non-African populations. We propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy of laser with medical treatment for glaucoma. We will compare two laser technologies, argon (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) with standard medical treatment. Study patients will also be enrolled into the GWAS study (Project 1) to look for genetic contributions that may influence treatment response using quantitative trait analysis. "
"9450150","PROJECT SUMMARY  To address health disparities in the twin epidemics of substance abuse and HIV, a well-trained cadre of researchers is  needed. Health disparities research in HIV and substance use problems has particular challenges in that it usually  involves the need to recruit hard-to-reach minority populations, engage minority communities, and effectively work in  multicultural, multidisciplinary teams to address the complex sets of psychosocial, interpersonal, community, and  structural factors driving these health disparities. Researchers from racial/ethnic minority groups are potentially well  positioned to conduct particularly impactful health disparities research because their experiences may lead to novel,  culturally relevant solutions to health disparities. The purpose of the Investigator Development Core is to support the  overall goals of the proposed FIU-RCMI by developing research opportunities for a group of early stage investigators,  particularly those from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority groups, who are committed to conducting research on  health disparities and to achieve the goal of successfully competing for peer-reviewed grant funding (e.g., R21, R01).  Thus, the objective of this Investigator Development Core is to provide a pilot project and mentoring program to assist  promising junior investigators in career development, with a focus on obtaining pilot data and publications in preparation  for external peer-reviewed grant funding. This objective will be achieved through the following four specific aims: 1)  Develop an equitable and transparent system to solicit and select up to 5 pilot projects a year including developing a  request for applications, submission guidelines, review criteria, and a process for convening peer reviewers and selecting  winning proposals; 2) Annually solicit applications, provide training in pilot project proposal development, provide a  rigorous peer review process that selects up to 5 pilot projects per year to receive funding, and provide constructive  feedback for all applicants; 3) Monitor progress of selected projects and ensure that all projects comply with applicable  Federal policies, rules, and guidelines for research involving human subjects and vertebrate animals, have appropriate  resource sharing plans, and result in publications; and 4) Establish a mentoring program where pilot project recipients will  meet regularly with FIU-RCMI faculty and other pilot project awardees for advice and support, including linkages to FIU-  RCMI research training, FIU-RCMI research opportunities, FIU-RCMI community connections, and career development  activities through the FIU-RCMI and university-wide programs. By the end of the five-year period, the program will  result in up to 20, primarily minority, early career investigators committed to health-disparities research, who will be well  positioned to compete for NIH funding as independent investigators."
"9325609","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by translation of an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene into a neurotoxic protein. There is no effective treatment or cure, although researchers are developing small interfering RNAs to target and degrade mutant mRNA. Because the normal HTT protein is essential for neuronal survival, therapies aim to spare wild-type mRNA. It may be possible to specifically target the mutant mRNA if mutant and wild-type alleles are processed differently after transcription. Research indicates mutant and wild-type mRNA exhibit different stability and localization, but the mechanism is unknown. One possibility is mutant mRNA is processed into a different isoforms with different localization and stability. Mutant and wild-type HTT mRNA are present as two 3'UTR isoforms. Indeed, preliminary data suggest mutant mRNA is more likely than wild-type mRNA to be present as the longer isoform. The proposed work aims to determine the mechanism and impact of differences in mutant and wild-type HTT 3'UTR isoforms. Because the mutation is proximal to gene regions involved in alternative polyadenylation (APA), the expansion may disrupt mutant HTT APA and cause the shift to the longer isoform. If so, other mRNAs and the other allele should be processed normally. To determine if the change in isoform length is HTT-specific, the length of HTT and other APA mRNAs will be assessed in heterozygous human samples by qPCR and deep sequencing. To verify the expansion is responsible, isoform lengths will be measured by qPCR from a transfected plasmid with or without the expansion. To assess whether the HTT isoform length changes during or after APA, the length of HTT isoforms from the plasmid will be assessed right after or much after labeling newly transcribed mRNAs with a modified nucleotide. These studies are the focus of Specific Aim 1. The change in mutant HTT isoform length likely impacts downstream processing because the 3'UTR contains many motifs directing mRNA stability and localization. To test this, the decay and localization of mutant and wild-type HTT isoforms will be assayed in normal and disease cells by transcriptional arrest and qPCR (decay) or fluorescent in-situ hybridization (localization). To verify differences are due to the isoform length, isoform localization and decay will be assayed in cell models transfected with a single HTT isoform. These studies are the focus of Specific Aim 2. Together, these studies will elucidate differences in mutant and wild-type mRNA APA, decay, and localization. Allele-specific small RNAs could then be designed to target mRNA regions or cellular compartments unique to the mutant isoform, improving treatment of this devastating disease."
"9307079","Animal models have tremendously advanced the research of human cancer. However, the technically challenging, time consuming, and expensive process to generate animal model of human cancer is still a bottleneck for cancer research and drug development. In the proposed project, we expand the application of the nanoparticle drug/gene delivery system to the development of mouse cancer model with the goal of overcoming the challenges of current genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. We will optimize the nanoparticle system for delivering tumorigenic DNA (plasmid DNA containing oncogenes or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing components) to the targeted mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells and fallopian tube epithelial cells. The efficacy of this method in inducing ovarian cancer in mice will be evaluated. The formed tumors will be characterized and compared to current GEM models. If the proposed study is successfully completed, the results will provide new tools for creating safe, effective, and economic in vivo cancer models. The success of this revolutionarily new method may greatly advance the mouse models of human diseases and open new horizons in both basic and applied cancer research."

"9484910","Abstract The overall goal of the Community Engagement and Dissemination Core (CEDC) is to conduct and coordinate dissemination activities that result in sustainable community and system-level changes in health indicators that influence the wellbeing of children and their families in the Southwest. SIRC will build and expand on its existing relationships developed with community members, partner and service organizations, the Community Advisory Board (CAB), and city, county and state policymakers to translate research findings from senior and junior researchers into sustainable system-level changes. While still a developing field, dissemination and implementation (D&I) science provides applicable theories and frameworks for the involvement of stakeholders, the development of a strategic plan, and the implementation of effective dissemination strategies related to adoption of evidence-based programs in the health sciences. Also, using the community based participatory research (CBPR) approach, our partners and community members will help guide this Core, and its commitment to involvement of four key audiences: (1) researchers and the scientific community; (2) health and community partner organizations and practitioners; (3) policy makers; and (4) lay individuals. Translating research findings into useable information depends upon the intended audience, thus many different types of activities will be conducted to disseminate the information generated by the Center. Importantly these activities will be vetted through the strategic dissemination planning process and the CAB, and each activity will be individualized to account for the audience, the content of the information and the channels. For example, presentations and papers for a variety of audiences will be produced and use of digital media will be integral. Further, these activities and the plan will use a variety of implementation and dissemination strategies that are likely to lead to adoption of interventions, changes in policies and practices, and changes in individuals' behaviors that influence the wellbeing of children and families. SIRC's strategic dissemination plan will be a collaborative effort among SIRC researchers, the CAB and community members, and media experts including the ASU PR Lab. The background research necessary to identify primary stakeholders who will benefit directly from findings of the research studies and pilots will be conducted, objectives and activities specified, timeframes and outcomes developed, staff assigned, and monitoring and evaluation will occur. We will take advantage of our already established and ongoing collaborations with CAB and other organizations to engage these agencies, their staff and their clients, in order to disseminate information and interventions that will be sustained and have a positive health impact for the targeted audiences in the Southwest."
"9392844","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical activity (PA) helps prevent obesity and reduce chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, and can be promoted through environmental/policy interventions at the population level. However, existing empirical knowledge on environment-PA relationships is primarily based on cross-sectional studies, which provide insufficient control of extraneous factors for investigating causal relationships. Further, little is known about how environmental factors affect spatial (where) and temporal (when) patterns of PA and the underlying mechanisms (why) of such impacts, including potential mediating effects of the psychosocial factors. The objective of this longitudinal, case-comparison study is to examine both short-term and long-term changes in PA after residents move to an activity-friendly community (AFC). It utilizes a unique and fleeting opportunity with ~3000 new homes being built in a large planned AFC over the next ~3 years. The focus is on those who are currently sedentary or insufficiently active and living in an environment lacking support for PA. Case participants (n~350) are those adults moving from non-AFCs to this AFC and not meeting the CDC guidelines for PA at pre-move baseline. Each case participant will be matched based on gender and age (5 years) with a comparison participant who lives in his/her pre-move non-AFC, is also sedentary or insufficiently active, and is not planning to move for at least two years (this project's follow-up measurement period). The specific aims of this proposed study are to (1) examine the short-term and long-term changes in total PA levels (weekly minutes) and in spatial and temporal patterns of PA (proportion of PA taking place within the community, proportion of walking out of total PA, and level of PA integration into daily routines), after sedentary or insufficiently active individuals move from non-AFCs to an AFC; and (2) determine what built and natural environmental factors (e.g. density, land uses, sidewalks, trails/paths, parks, water features) lead to changes in PA among these populations, either directly or indirectly by affecting psychosocial factors related to PA. Using this timely opportuniy to gain longitudinal assessments for this natural experiment is of critical importance to advancing the status of knowledge on the intersection of health and place as it relates to promoting PA. The interdisciplinary research team has extensive experiences on this topic and in this study community through pilot work. At the conclusion of this study, we will have identified stronger evidence supporting the impact of an AFC on population-level behavior changes toward more physically active lifestyles (short-term goal) and toward lessening the burden of obesity throughout the nation (long-term goal)."
"9562007","The JPL EDRN Informatics Center develops data-intensive informatics solutions to support the Early Detection Research Network in capturing, processing, managing, distributing and analyzing data from cancer biomarker research. The earlier cancer is detected, the more effective the treatment. That's why it's the mission of the Early Detection Research Network to research biomarkers. Biomarkers are indicators of disease or the potential for disease. Managing the enormous amount of knowledge, information, and data that goes into biomarker research requires a herculean effort. That's why EDRN turned to Jet Propulsion Laboratory to become EDRN's Informatics Center. JPL and NCI have worked together to build a leading edge, national, bioinformatics network for the capture, management, distribution and analysis of cancer research data. This network is based on leveraging the technologies, capabilities, and expertise of JPL in building scientific data-intensive systems across multiple disciplines. This includes the use of Apache OODT, originally developed by JPL, and now part of the Apache Software Foundation. OODT provides an open source, data management framework for building the EDRN Knowledge System or EKE. EKE is a virtual knowledge-base of biomarkers, studies, publications, and resulting science data from EDRN research that is integrated and powered by a semantic-based search. While the system appears fully integrated, it is really a virtual data system with data distributed at a national level. The infrastructure developed by the EDRN Informatics Center (IC) will not only support EDRN over the next five years but is well positioned to support other programs currently being developed under the leadership of the Cancer Biomarkers Research Group (CBRG). One such program is the Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions (MCL) consortium.  The MCL is a Consortium that consists of independent, multi-disciplinary teams to conduct comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of tumor tissue, cell, and microenvironment components to distinguish indolent from aggressive cancer among screen-detected early lesions, as well as between screen-detected from interval and symptom-detected cancers."
"9543765","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an uncommon subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), comprising less than 10% of all NHL diagnoses, characterized by frequent relapses and shortened survival. There are no currently available curative therapies and no standard front-line therapy exists. Initial treatment includes intensive combination chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation or less aggressive approaches with maintenance rituximab, depending on the age and performance status of the patient. Recently, ibrutinib, an oral bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has had significant activity in patients wit relapsed disease and patients have remained on the agent up to 2-years with limited toxicities. The primary aim of this proposal is to develop a specialized center for research at the Ohio State University (OSU) focused on novel therapeutics and combinations with ibrutinib in MCL and to train new investigators in the field. Dr. Blum has mentored multiple trainees over the past five years; however, training opportunities and funding for lymphoma clinical research is limited and insufficient to address the clinical challenges of drug development in MCL and other NHL subtypes. This award will support Dr. Blum's efforts to develop a clinical research training program designed to support and train junior faculty, hematology/oncology fellows, residents, and medical students at OSU and nationally in the complexities of superior clinical research. The primary aims of this specialized research program include all of the following: 1. To explore novel therapeutic combinations with ibrutinib (including combinations with lenalidomide, palbociclib, KPT-330, and rituximab and bendamustine) as therapy for patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent MCL, 2. To evaluate other novel agents in the B-cell receptor signaling and similar pathways (including BKM120, LEE011, and MLN8237) in patients with ibrutinib resistant MCL, and 3. To develop an institutional and national clinical research mentoring program in clinical investigation in B-cell malignancies. Aims 1-3 (50% of Dr. Blum's efforts) will serve to develop the careers of junior faculty, fellows, and residents at OSU and within the United States committed to clinical research in lymphoma through mentoring programs conducted at OSU, through the American Society of Hematology, and through the Lymphoma Research Foundation. Ultimately, with Dr. Blum's mentorship in the conduct of these trials with ibrutinib and other novel agents, it is anticipated that several of these trainees will become independent investigators in the field of NHL therapeutics that not only have a track record of publication, but also have career development funding including NCI K23 and foundation grants to support their research."

The goal of this K99/R00 project is to test the hypothesis that cytochromes P450 from Actinomycetales, a diverse subfamily of remarkable biocatalysts, may be used as a means to discover natural products with novel functionalities. We propose to (Aim 1) investigate the sequence?structure?function relationships of novel P450s from selected natural product biosynthetic pathways, (Aim 2) use a P450-focused genome mining approach to discover natural products that have undergone unique P450-catalyzed transformations, and (Aim 3) employ the newly identified P450s, and their homologues, as models for P450 enzymology and bioengineering. The multidisciplinary approach involves bioinformatics analysis, in vitro enzymology, protein X-ray crystallography, in vivo pathway engineering, (un)natural product isolation and structural determination. Superb preliminary data supports both the feasibility of the proposed mentored phase in a two-year time span, and a successful transition to an independent research program. The innovation of this application lies in leveraging the diversity of natural P450 variants from a proprietary Actinomycetales strain collection for discovering unprecedented chemistries that imbue natural products with new functionalities.

"9356673","SUMMARY Somatic mutations in the core components of the pre-mRNA splicing complex, the spliceosome, are the most common genetic lesions in patients with myelodsyplastic syndromes (MDS). Specifically, recurrent missense mutations in the SF3B1 gene are present in 10-20% of all MDS cases. Inhibitors of SF3B1 have been developed and represent a promising new frontier for MDS therapy. We propose to develop pre-clinical models of Sf3b1 mutation, to test a novel SF3B1 inhibitor in these models, alone or in combination with azacitidine; and to perform correlative studies on a Phase I/II clinical trial of an SF3B1 inhibitor in collaboration with H3 Biomedicine. H3 Biomedicine has generated a compound, H3B 8800, that shows promising mutant- selective activity in cell lines and that is poised for clinical trials. The Ebert laboratory has developed a conditional knock-in mouse model that expresses the Sf3b1 K700E mutation, the most common mutation in MDS patients. Since SF3B1 mutations commonly co-occur with mutations in DNMT3A in MDS, we will create a model with both conditional Sf3b1 knock-in mutation and conditional Dnmt3a inactivation. We will test H3B 8800 in this model and will test the combination of H3B 8800 with azacitidine, a drug with efficacy in MDS and in TET2-mutated cases in particular. We will identify mechanisms of resistance to H3B 8800 using a genome- wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. Finally, we will examine the safety and efficacy of H3B 8800 in MDS patients in a phase I/II clinical trial. This first-in-class agent has the potential for major clinical impact in a large fraction of MDS cases with aberrant spliceosome function due to somatic mutations. The studies described in this proposal will define the activity of the drug in different genetic backgrounds, examine the activity of the drug in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, identify mechanisms of therapy resistance as well as insights into the mode of action of the drug, and examine therapeutic efficacy in patients."
"9467893","Project Summary  Development of novel cancer therapies that selectively target cancer cells through mechanisms unique to cancer biology remains an important challenge in the fight against cancer. This task is made even more difficult due to the vast number of different cancer types, each with its own unique biology. However, certain biological pathways are common to many different varieties of cancer, providing an opportunity for the development of a general therapy for cancer treatment. One such pathway is hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, which has been suggested to be the driving force for around 70% of human cancer types. Development of a selective small molecule inhibitor of this pathway would represent a major step forward in cancer treatment, enabling effective treatment of a diverse range of different cancer types.  Pleurotin is an antibiotic fungal metabolite first isolated in 1947 and found to possess powerful anticancer properties. Despite being known for 70 years, the exact mechanism of pleurotin?s anticancer effect remains unknown, although it is proposed to function through inhibition of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. This proposed biological mode of action has made pleurotin a high value target for both biological studies and chemical synthesis. This research proposal describes a short chemical synthesis of pleurotin through rapid formation of the challenging trans- hydrindane motif found in the natural product. Due to the prevalence of trans-hydrindane structures in a variety of natural products, this strategy should enable the synthesis of a wealth of molecules with varied biological activity. The research plan also outlines the synthesis and biological testing of novel pleurotin analogs. The combination of analog synthesis and biological assays will allow for the elucidation of the mechanism of pleurotin?s anticancer properties, potentially leading to new general treatments for cancer. Overall, the proposed research will allow for the rapid synthesis of an important natural product and provide valuable information on the mechanism of inhibition of a prevalent driving force in human cancer."

To this end, Core A will focus on the recent significant progress made by the Program Project in the development of small molecule and peptidomimetic viral entry antagonists, in conjunction with the emerging structural information of both gpl20 monomer and the Env trimer. We will focus on three Env interfaces that mediate HIV-1 infection. These are: (A) the highly conserved CD4-gp120 binding site; (B) the chemokine receptor-gp120 V3-loop interface; and (C) the gp41-interacfing element of gpl20. During the recent grant period Core A successfully guided cycles of design, synthesis and structure determination for gp 120 antagonists. Building on this success, we will continue to integrate with Crystallography (Hendrickson and Kwong), Virology (Sodroski), Peptide and Mini-proteins (Chaiken), Small Molecule Synthesis (Smith), Thermodynamics (Freire), and Single Molecule FRET (Mothes and Blanchard). Antagonists (peptides, small molecules and fragments) discovered and validated by these groups, will in turn be optimized computationally by Core A, and in collaboration with the Synthetic (Smith) and Peptide/Peptidomimetic Projects (Chaiken) advance novel small molecules and peptides for virological testing and validation (Sodroski)."
"9370637","Abstract   Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is the bane of elective total joint replacement (TJR) surgery, of  which the vast majority is caused by Staphylococcal species. The 1-5% incidence of PJI is known to be  a nonrandom event that is largely determined by patient specific factors. Moreover, ~13% of patients  infected with S. aureus become septic and die from multiorgan failure, while others recover with little  intervention. In addition to the established host susceptibility factors, there are two leading theories to  explain this. The first is the ?immune proteome? hypothesis, which posits that the array of specific  antibodies a host develops against S. aureus dictates its susceptibility vs. protection to infection. The  second is the ?Trojan horse? model of S. aureus dissemination, in which leukocytes get infected at the  surgical site, and transport intracellular bacteria to the blood stream and internal organs, culminating in  septic death of susceptible hosts. Currently, there is no direct experimental or clinical evidence to  support these theories. However, we recently made several potential breakthrough discoveries that  substantiate these models. The first is that antibodies against the autolysin (Atl) proteins efficiently  induce megacluster formation, opsonophagocytosis, and protection/survival following S. aureus  osteomyelitis in mice and humans. The second is that iron sensing determinant B (IsdB) is the most  immuno-dominant S. aureus antigen in mouse and man, and that antibodies against IsdB are  associated with sepsis, multiorgan failure and death following surgical site infection.8,13 Here we  propose to: 1) elucidate the molecular mechanism of anti-IsdB mediated septic death, 2) validate the  ?susceptible? anti-Isd vs. ?protective? anti-Atl immune proteome in PJI patients, and 3) extend this  osteoimmunology to elucidate the immune proteomes of S. epidermidis and S. lugdunensis. Our  approaches to achieve these goals are embodied by three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will elucidate  the mechanism of anti-IsdB and related anti-IsdA and anti-IsdH antibody mediated sepsis following S.  aureus osteomyelitis. We will also complete a clinical pilot study to demonstrate that osteomyelitis  patients who succumb to S. aureus septic death have high anti-Isd titers and Trojan horse  macrophages in their blood and internal organs. In Aim 2 we will test the immune proteome hypothesis  by correlating anti-Isd and anti-Atl titers with the clinical outcomes of 300 PJI patients that undergo 2-  stage revision surgery using our multiplex-Luminex assay, and define the susceptible:protective index  of these immune proteomes. And in Aim 3 we will extend our knowledge of the mammalian host  response to Staphylococcus species by generate multiplex-Luminex assays for S. epidermidis and S.  lugdunensis, and uses them to screen sera from mice and PJI patients as we have done for S. aureus.  !"
"9358855","ABSTRACT The 2014 Surgeon General's report indicated that there was suggestive evidence demonstrating that ventilated filters have played a role in the increased incidence of lung adenocarcinoma. In a more recent weight of evidence review by us, including an in-depth analysis of biological plausibility, we concluded that there was highly suggestive evidence that filter ventilation paradoxically increased the risk of lung adenocarcinoma, while other lung cancers decreased with decreasing smoking prevalence. This increase in risk is based on how ventilation alters the way the cigarette burns and the elasticity of the cigarette that allows greater delivery of nicotine and harmful smoke constituents to the peripheral parts of the lung, where adenocarcinomas more commonly occur. A strong case can be made for the FDA to consider regulating filter ventilation, including a ban, based on the increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma, enhanced toxicant exposures, misperceptions about the relative safety of these cigarettes and increased abuse liability resulting from the cigarette's elasticity. However, to date, there are no studies on the impact of removing filter ventilation on smoking behavior and resultant exposures and toxicity. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to assess this, and importantly to do so in the context of an experimental marketplace that allows and does not allow access to alternative nicotine delivery systems (ANDS; e.g., e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and nicotine replacement therapy). Secondary aims include studying the predictors of exposure and the type and characteristics of ANDS that are chosen. The study design is a 2 x 2, in which smokers will be randomized (N=125 in each of 4 conditions and 20% dropout rate for final N=400) to ventilated or unventilated cigarettes, with and without access to ANDS. Both validated exposure and novel biomarkers (e.g., metabolomics and gene expression) collected in urine, blood, and lung will be analyzed during the course of the study. Smoking behavior will be assessed by puff topography and inhalation. We hypothesize that subjects using unventilated cigarettes will experience: 1) fewer cigarettes smoked; 2) less toxicant exposure and effect; 3) less smoking intensity and depth of inhalation; and 4) greater number of days abstinent from cigarettes, with greater effects observed among those smokers with access to ANDS. Furthermore, the predictors of cigarette use and exposure biomarkers will be dependent on cigarette type, access to ANDS, consumer perceptions and response to the cigarettes, demographic and smoking history variables. The type of product chosen will likely be e-cigarettes with higher nicotine doses and that are flavored. This project is innovative because it is the first to explore the effects of unventilated vs. ventilated cigarettes on a broad range of biomarkers, including ones that target the lung specifically, and within the context of a marketplace with ANDS. It is significant because it will provide the FDA information on whether or not there might be any unintended consequences if cigarette filter ventilation was eliminated."

"9420305","With the expansion in technologies and the required expertise to implement them, it has become necessary for principal investigators to rely on scientists with a more permeant scientific position in order to maintain scientific output and continuity. To promote the development of these research specialists, the NCI recently established a new funding mechanism, the R50, to pay the salary of career scientists who do not want to become independent investigators, but rather want to pursue research within an existing NCI funded program.  As a research specialist, I will actively participate in two separate but related research programs in the Tansey laboratory, both of which stem from my recent work that defined a function for the central portion of MYC. The MYC oncogenes encode a family of related transcription factors that are overexpressed in the majority of cancers and contribute to an estimated 100,000 cancer-related deaths in the USA every year. MYC proteins derive their oncogenicity from their ability to bind chromatin and to modulate the transcription of thousands of genes controlling cell growth, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, genomic instability, and metabolic reprograming. While it has been demonstrate that certain epigenetic modifications are a prerequisite for MYC binding to chromatin, a long standing issue has been determining how exactly MYC is recruited to its target genes within the context of chromatin.  Because several motifs within the central portion of MYC are highly conserved throughout evolution I reasoned they might be important for MYC function. To test this hypothesis, I designed a strategy that integrated two-hybrid and proteomic screening of the central portion of human c-MYC and identified WDR5 as a bonafide MYC interacting protein. WDR5 functions as a central component of several epigenetic `writer' complexes, including the MLL1 methyltransferase where its canonical role is to stimulate enzymatic activity by bridging MLL1 to its co-activators. I demonstrated that WDR5 is essential for targeting MYC to its target genes and that this interaction is necessary for MYC induced tumor formation and the genesis of induced pluripotent stem cells. Based on these seminal findings, we propose to test our model of Facilitated Recruitment, which posits that widespread association of MYC transcriptional complexes with target gene chromatin involves two critical sets of interactions: one with DNA and another with pre-bound and proximal WDR5 (to be funded by the NCI - 1R01CA200709). We also hypothesize, and in collaboration with the Fesik group at Vanderbilt, that we can identify small molecules that prevent WDR5 from engaging MLL1 as a means of cancer therapy (Funded by NCI Experimental Therapeutics Program Subcontract No. 29XS129TO27). The purpose of this grant is to cover my salary for these two research programs in the Tansey laboratory."
"9449072","Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are characterized by a range of reported deficits and impairments. However, detailed knowledge about their underlying mechanisms and explanatory models is currently lacking. A novel concept, supported by growing evidence, is that autism may well be primarily a disorder of prediction. Impairments of structural and functional connectivity reported in children with ASD are entirely consistent with this concept. The brain processes information by constantly making predictions about future developments in the surrounding environment, based on information from previous experience. Violations of expectations are used by the brain to adjust and make future more accurate predictions as part of the learning process. Impairments in this function may be among the key underlying core deficits in ASD. Of direct relevance to this concept, we have recently discovered a new mechanism for predictive learning in the visual cortex, which acts through modulation of persistent activity (neuronal activity, which lasts beyond the time of initial sensory stimulus). Persistent activity functions to encode information about the timing of prospective salient events, and is hypothesized to be the underlying cellular basis of working memory. Since Fragile X Syndrome, like other forms of ASDs, is characterized by impairment of structural and functional circuit connectivity, there is a critical need to establish how these aberrations of circuit connectivity lead to impaired neural activity and predictive learning in ASDs. To address this need, we will first identify impaired synaptic connections within the cortical microcircuit of Fragile X mice. Second, we will test the hypothesis that predictive coding is impaired in Fragile X mice. Finally, we will establish a causal link between impaired persistent activity and aberrant visual perception and learning in Fragile X mice. The results of these studies are expected to help establish a strong evidence- based framework for systematic characterization of additional single gene mutations associated with ASD, which may ultimately lead to potential development of targeted circuit-specific therapies for successful treatment of autism."
"9538380","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is widely held that the establishment and course of HIV infection is determined by the interplay between viral replication and humoral responses to viral envelope trimers that mediate host cell attachment and entry. Accordingly, intensive efforts have been directed towards understanding the structural, functional and antigenic characteristics of HIV trimers. Such information promises to reveal insights for developing antiviral countermeasures, including envelope-targeted antiviral agents and vaccines based on anti-envelope antibodies.     The nature of HIV envelope trimers has been examined primarily in the context of free virions. However, several lines of evidence suggest that HIV envelope trimers on virions transition through a series of conformations in solution and/or as they engage up to three CD4 receptor molecules during viral attachment. This in turns suggests certain testable hypotheses concerning the nature of viral trimers. One that will be tested in this project holds that the flexibility and antigenicity of trimers progressively changes as trimers become progressively saturated with CD4. A related hypothesis, also explored in this project, is that certain conformations allow combinations of neutralizing antibodies and/or both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies to bind a single trimer. Our preliminary studies suggest that the latter situation frequently occurs on virions, whereas data from virus capture assays of immunochemical studies with purified soluble trimers suggest that neutralizing epitopes are expressed on native trimers in the absence of non-neutralizing epitopes. Accurate evaluations of these hypotheses demands a means to interrogate virions as they naturally exist in solution, without extensive technical manipulation. Previously we reported a single molecule approach based on the use of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to characterize epitope exposures on free virions with all reactants (e.g. antibodies, soluble CD4) continuously in solution. More recently, we have expanded this approach such that we can probe virions simultaneously with multiple antibodies in combination with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). This novel approach detects multiple epitope exposures on a single virion trimer. It concurrently reveals conformational dynamics as a function of FRET between two epitope probes. Most importantly, such measures are accomplished using our approach without genetic or external perturbations of virions. Thus, we can collect unprecedented information regarding the structural and antigenic dynamics of the HIV envelope, which should provide novel insights for the generation of antiviral agents and anti-HIV immunity. We propose three aims: Aim 1) To characterize the exposure of multiple epitopes on single, virion-associated HIV trimers. Aim 2) To examine the conformational dynamics of gp120 on HIV virions. Aim 3) To characterize conformational flexibility before and during ligand binding to soluble cleaved trimers."
"9370635","Abstract  The field of Osteoimmunology was established in 2005 to understand how bone influences immune and  hematopoietic cells, as well as how hematopoietic and immune cells influence bone, in clinical conditions like  prosthetic joint infection (PJI). However, critical tools and research protocols for discovery, and technologies  required to translate discoveries into clinical diagnostics and interventions for osteomyelitis, did not exist at the  commencement of our AO Trauma Clinical Priority Program (AO-CPP) 5 years ago. Thus, we assembled a  multidisciplinary team of investigators with extensive experience in bone pathology, microbial pathogenesis,  immunology, electron microscopy, material science & engineering, infectious disease and orthopaedic surgery,  to enable the major advances that serve as the scientific premise of this Center of Research Translation on the  Osteoimmunology of Bone Infection (CoRTOBI). Despite these major advances, additional assay and  technology development is needed to complete the research projects in this CoRTOBI. Thus, the goals of the  Osteoimmunology Research Core are to: 1) provide the CoRTOBI investigators with state-of-the-art research  resources that do not exist elsewhere; and 2) develop novel technologies and assays for future  osteoimmunology research. Our approaches to achieve these goals are embodied by the following Specific  Aims. In Aim 1 we will process the samples and perform all of the electron microscopy on the infected bone  and fabricated nanoporous membranes in Project 1; and the ?Trojan horse? macrophages and tissue  abscesses in Project 2. In Aim 2 we will generate the array of nanoporous membranes varying in pore sizes to  assess the haptotaxis, metamorphic and durotaxis behaviors of S. aureus in vitro, and clone the genes  involved as novel antibiotic targets using a candidate gene and TnSeq mutant library screening approach. In  Aim 3 we will use our 3D-printing technology to assess novel antibiotic spacers in vivo in Project 1. In Aim 4  we will screen all the sera from the animal studies, and the 300 PJI patients in the AO-CPP registry, using our  14-antigen multiplex Luminex assay, and as technology development, we will add additional S. aureus  antigens to our multiplex Luminex assay. In Project 2, we will also generate novel multiplex-Luminex assays  for S. epidermidis and S. lugdunensis, and use them to screen sera from mice and PJI patients, as we have  done for S. aureus. Finally, in Aim 5 we will establish protocols for screening and cloning antibody-secreting  cells (ASC) in whole blood from mice and humans infected with S. aureus. We will also develop reproducible  methods to expand and clone anti-S. aureus ASC directly from murine and human blood as new technology in  the Core. Importantly, it is also our intent to share our resources with investigators outside of this CoRTOBI,  and transport our research platforms to other institutions with a research focus on Staphylococcal infections,  and osteomyelitis.  !"
"9546956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Tumor Biology and Microenvironment (TBM) Program aims to eradicate cancer by identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive interactions between tumors and their microenvironments, and develop and test innovative diagnostic and treatment strategies. This highly integrated program includes 36 members from 16 WSU departments and $14,193,608 in grants, of which $5,908,215 is peer reviewed. The Program goals are addressed with three themes that encompass basic, preclinical, and clinical research. The first theme identifies and exploits the mechanisms that confer phenotypical plasticity and survival of tumor cells in tumor progression. Translational research is conducted to evaluate the potential clinical application of these molecular determinants as tumor markers and/or therapeutic targets. The second theme identifies and exploits the mechanisms that confer the unhealable wounding of tumor stroma. Our investigators identify and characterize factors in an extracellular proteolysis and signaling network that enable tumor cells to adapt to and subvert the microenvironment in the development of bone metastases. Key molecules in this network are evaluated to determine if they can be used to predict cancer progression and treatment outcomes. The third theme identifies and exploits the host immune response to tumor progression. Bispecific antibody-armed activated T-cells are tested in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies in the context of chemotherapy or high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Anti-tumor DNA vaccines are developed and tested using mouse and domesticated cat models. Our investigators study immune modulators and inhibitors of adverse pro-inflammatory responses. Our members also develop novel vehicles to deliver immunotherapeutic agents. TBM Program members actively collaborate with members of the MI, MT, and PSDR Programs at KCI. Of the 612 manuscripts published from December 2010 to November 2014, 44% and 38% were intra- and inter-programmatic, respectively, and 27% were multi-institutional collaborations."
"9464596","Project Summary  Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are estimated to affect more than 1% of children under 8 years of age in the US. These neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by impaired social communication, restrictive interests and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. There are frequent co-morbidities in ASD, including epilepsy and intellectual disability. ASD can be divided into two main categories based on differing causal factors. Syndromic ASD are caused by highly penetrant, single gene mutations or genetic copy number variants that impact clinically relevant genes, while idiopathic ASD result from more complex combinations of genetic and environmental factors. Despite decades of effort, no drugs are available for specific treatment of ASD, which remain a major area of unmet medical need. Drug discovery for ASD has been limited by a lack of knowledge of underlying disease biology. Recent progress in elucidating the genetic basis of ASD is providing a foundation for new therapeutic discovery approaches. Evidence for synaptic dysfunction in genetic models of syndromic ASD and the identification of mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins in idiopathic autism suggest that alterations in neurotransmission represent a core pathogenic mechanism. Moreover, there is evidence for shared disease mechanisms among ASD, including syndromic and idiopathic forms. These lines of evidence support therapeutic discovery strategies aimed at identifying and targeting shared neurophysiological disease mechanisms in ASD. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine our Optopatch all-optical electrophysiology platform with a newly developed method to modulate gene expression (CRISPR interference) and to apply this system to parallel generation and neurophysiological characterization of multiple ASD genetic loss-of-function models. Optopatch is the only optogenetic system with compatible, genetically-encoded actuator and voltage sensor components, enabling light-mediated stimulation and precise recording of electrical activity in neurons with unprecedented throughput. CRISPRi achieves gene knockdown by targeting a transcriptional repressor hybrid protein, KRAB-dCas9, to a specified gene target via a complementary guide RNA. Efficient knockdown of multiple genes is achieved simply by changing the guide RNA. We will first optimize the CRISPRi/Optopatch system and then apply it to characterizing effects on neuronal activity and synaptic transmission in neuronal knockdown models for 20 ASD genes defined by loss- of-function mutations. Through this large-scale phenotyping effort, we propose to identify core disease mechanisms in ASD. If successful, the program will be positioned for Phase II research aimed at generating commercially valuable, validated phenotypic screening assays for ASD drug discovery. Validated assays will provide an attractive basis for discovery partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to discover and develop novel, mechanism-based treatments for ASD. Ultimately, this program stands to benefit the large population of ASD patients and their families and caregivers by enabling discovery of new treatments."
"9528932","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project has as its aim the development of robust, practical, and general methods for glycosylating nucleophiles with predictable stereoselectivity. Our laboratory has helped pioneer the use of small-molecule chiral H-bond donors as catalysts for enantioselective reactions. As an extension of these studies, we have uncovered a new principle for effecting selective glycosylation reactions. Precisely designed macrocyclic bis-thiourea catalysts promote stereospecific, invertive reactions of alcohol nucleophiles with glycosyl chlorides. Because glycosyl chlorides are quite stable and exist predominantly and often exclusively in the a-configuration, this mode of catalysis represents a widely applicable solution to the creation of -glycosidic linkages. We will seek to explore the scope and limitations of the macrocylic catalysts devised thus far in the context of model disaccharide couplings and the synthesis representative biologically important oligosaccharides. The rate of glycosylation is correlated to the Lewis basicity of the carbonyl group on the catalyst, and our current mechanistic hypothesis invokes a functional role for this moiety as a general base to activate the acceptor nucleophile in a manner that mimics invertive glycosyltransferases. We will carry out a systematic mechanistic study of the catalytic reaction in order to ascertain whether a biomimetic general-base mechanism is indeed operative, and to identify the optimal nature and position of the Lewis base component for maximum reactivity and scope. We will also explore whether this cooperative activation mechanism might be extended to the design of catalysts that promote a-selective glycosylations via doubly invertive substitutions. If developed fully and successfully, this methodology would enable the synthesis of complex oligosaccharides in a programmable manner that could be applied by non-specialists, and also allow the production of biomedically relevant glycans, glycopeptides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and microbial polysaccharides and glycoconjugates on a practical scale."

"9465351","Project Summary This SBIR Phase II project will address the need for column chromatography products that can simplify the purification process for therapeutic biologics and increase purification speed. The rapid pace of biologics development, driven in part by growth of emerging markets such as personalized medicine, has increased the demand for affordable and fast, small-batch production runs in multi-product biopharmaceutical facilities. Disposable technologies like the one proposed that can rapidly and efficiently purify biologics will contribute to improving human health by enabling the small-batch production of affordable medications. The products of this SBIR Phase II project will be single-use, multimodal anion-exchange membrane (MMAEX) chromatography columns that have a high capacity for removing impurities such as host cell proteins, DNA and aggregates from biologic products under conditions of high solution conductivity. Current products have low capacities, and the efficiency of impurity removal is heavily compromised at elevated solution conductivities. By overcoming these limitations, Purilogics' products will enable rapid purification without buffer exchange or adding additional chromatography steps, thus saving time and simplifying the purification process. In Phase I, we proved the feasibility of fabricating high capacity MMAEX membrane columns. Product prototypes outperformed the best competing products, and performance metrics exceeded the defined acceptance criteria for moving to Phase II. A partner biopharmaceutical company used the prototypes to purify cancer antibodies 10 times faster than their current practice and attained the same purity level. The aims of the Phase II study are (i) to develop MMAEX membranes with increased capacity, reduced purification time, and enhanced impurity removal capability; (ii) to finalize a production process for sterile membrane columns with defined product shelf life, and (iii) to delineate operating ranges and conduct field research on membrane column prototypes. In Specific Aim 1, systematic studies will be carried out to determine the roles played by synthesis conditions and membrane properties on performance. In Specific Aim 2, a semi-continuous process will be established to produce prototypes for determining sterilization protocols and product shelf life. A scale-down spiral-wound membrane column will be designed and fabricated to collect data for predicting performance at large scale. In Specific Aim 3, Purilogics will collaborate with researchers at Clemson University and University of Arkansas to identify the MMAEX column operating design space and to determine viral clearance. Field research will be done at the facilities of three industry partners to develop novel purification schemes for different types of biologics. The new column will be compared against commercial products. Market entry will be through sales to scientists and engineers in biologics research and development laboratories through established channels. The addressable market for single-use polishing step purification columns <1 L is expected to reach $271 million by 2020."
"9262699","PROJECT SUMMARY In vivo screening of phage libraries in live mice has been used to identify peptides that direct phage homing to a tumor. The power of in vivo phage screening is illustrated by the recent discovery of peptides with unique tumor- penetrating properties. These peptides activate an endocytic transport pathway related to but distinct from macropinocytosis. They do so through a complex process that involves binding to a primary, tumor-specific receptor, a proteolytic cleavage, and binding to a second receptor. The second receptor, neuropilin-1 (or neuropilin-2) activates the transport pathway. This trans-tissue pathway, dubbed the CendR pathway, mediates the extravasation and transport through tumor tissue of payloads ranging from small molecule drugs to nanoparticles (NPs). The CendR technology provides a solution to a major problem in tumor therapy, nanotherapy in particular, which is poor penetration of drugs into tumors. Targeting with these peptides has been shown to specifically increase the accumulation of NPs in experimental tumors in vivo, and into human tumors ex vivo. Remarkably the payload does not have to be coupled to the peptide; the peptide activates a bulk transport system that sweeps along NPs present in the blood. Treatment studies in mice have shown improved anti-tumor efficacy and less damage to normal tissues with nanoparticle drugs such as Abraxane (Nab-paclitaxel) and Doxil (doxorubicin-loaded liposomes). Tumor-homing peptides, including tumor-penetrating peptides, are particularly well suited for NP targeting because the multivalent presentation of a peptide on NPs makes up for the relatively low affinity of such peptides through the avidity effect, enabling potent homing to a target. High-throughput screening has been used to identify chemical compounds that mimic the binding specificities of the tumor-penetrating peptides. We have shown that a peptidomimetic compound, despite its modest affinity, can be suitable for NP targeting without further optimization. Moreover, drugs coupled to the surface of NPs may benefit from a similar effect, as has been shown for one compound. An increase of inherent functional activities of a peptide, such as the anti-metastatic effect of the CendR peptide iRGD, can also ensue. A recent study provides insight to the nature and regulation of the CendR pathway, but important aspects of the pathway, such as the mechanism of transport from one cell to another, remain unknown. Full utilization of the CendR technology will require greater understanding of the pathway and improved compounds for targeting through this pathway. This application proposes using siRNA and in vivo imaging studies to elucidate the mechanisms of the CendR transport in tissue, as well as identification of CendR-active chemical compounds for improved targeting of NPs through this pathway. New technology for nanoparticle targeting is expected to ensue."

"9344905","Bladder cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. Three quarters of the nearly 75,000 men and women diagnosed with bladder cancer just this year will have a less aggressive form of the disease which, after treatment, will require frequent visits to the urologist for invasive, painful cystoscopy procedures for the remainder of their lifetimes to determine if the cancer has returned. And the disease will recur in about half of these patients. This is a significant contributing factor to why bladder cancer is considered the most expensive cancer to treat per case and why there exists a compelling need to make the surveillance of bladder cancer recurrence less invasive for patients and more cost-effective for the healthcare system. Unfortunately, the current methods of detecting bladder cancer in urine specimens, an ideal alternative to cystoscopy, are not sufficiently accurate to replace cystoscopy. SynderBio Inc. is developing a device that could be placed at the point of care in the urologist's clinic to rapidly process urine specimens in a way that improves the diagnostic accuracy of routine urine cytology preparations that have been used for decades, but that lack the sensitivity to detect low-grade bladder cancers. SynderBio's first-in-class technology is based on findings that intrinsic biophysical properties can distinguish benign and malignant cells. SynderBio achieves a rapid enrichment of malignant cells by a patented application of brief pulses of very high level fluid shear stress that destroys benign cells, leaving malignant cells that are resistance to this stress and remain intact and viable. SynderBio's approach is innovative because, unlike its use of a unique biophysical biomarker, all of its competitors use specific molecular biomarkers to identify cancer cells in urine specimens. The long-term goal of this project is to improve significantly the detection of bladder cancer recurrence in urine specimens using SynderBio's product. The Phase I hypothesis is that resistance to fluid shear stress is a biomarker that can be used to enrich malignant urothelial cells. The Aims of the Phase I STTR feasibility project are to: 1) Determine if bladder carcinoma cell lines exhibit greater resistance to FSS in vitro compared to benign urothelial cells; and 2) Determine the feasibility of FSS to improve cytology from bladder cancer patients. Phase II objectives are to 1) transform SynderBio's current pre-prototype device into a commercial-ready product; and 2) expand the clinical testing of this device to determine the extent to which it will improve the accuracy of urine-based testing for bladder cancer. The commercial opportunity for SynderBio's product is significant. Over 2.7 million people worldwide are living with bladder cancer. In the US, bladder cancer surveillance is estimated to be a billion dollar market by 2020. SynderBio's cell separation technology can also be applied to other cancer diagnostic and research purposes, including solid-tissue biopsies. Thus, there is significant commercial potential for SynderBio to build a business to address bladder cancer and other unmet clinical diagnostic needs, thereby improving human health and quality of life."
"9562180","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ParaTechs Corporation develops innovative technologies for biomedical research while seeking to improve animal welfare for laboratory animals. One of ParaTechs' major goals is to further the guiding principles of ethical animal use by 'reducing, replacing and refining' the use of animals in research, according to the guidelines of Russell and Burch's 3Rs of animal research. ParaTechs already has brought to market a non-surgical embryo transfer device (NSETTM) for mice, which replaces surgical embryo transfers with a non-surgical method that has been proven to cause less stress in research animals. The goal of this project is to develop a device and a research protocol for nonsurgical embryo transfer in rats. The device and protocol is to be rapid, easy to use, cost effective, and efficien for embryo transfer. Poof of principle for the project was established during Phase I, where multiple prototypes of a rat NSET device were designed, manufactured, and tested. Rat embryos were transferred and viable rat pups were obtained, demonstrating the first successful nonsurgical embryo transfer in rats. The goal of Phase II is to further establish the parameters of rat NSET technology and to develop the device for commercialization to the biomedical research community. Four objectives are proposed to achieve this goal. First, we will determine the efficiency of non-surgical embryo transfer relative to surgical embryo transfer in Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 rats, for both morula and blastocyst stage embryos. This study will have broad applications for transfer of cryopreserved embryos and for transfer of genetically modified embryos after introduction of embryonic stem cells. Second, we will transfer in vitro cultured embryos using the rNSET and compared efficiency to surgical embryo transfer techniques. This aim will address successful transfer of rat embryos that may be modified very early in development; for example, after pronuclear injection for the purpose of genetic modification. Third, we will test the use of the rat NSET for artificial insemination as an alternative to surgical techniques. This aim will support the use of the device as an alternative t surgical artificial insemination and as a possible alternative to in vitro fertilization. Fourth, w will assess the level of stress reduction of the NSET procedure compared to surgical embryo transfer. These aims are consistent with ParaTechs' overall goal to improve animal welfare and support more effective and humane use of animal models in biomedical research."
"9398287","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Staphylococcus aureus is a widespread human pathogen, capable of infecting nearly every organ in the human body. S. aureus is particularly adept at colonizing the bone to cause osteomyelitis. Indeed, S. aureus is the most common cause of both acute and chronic osteomyelitis. Skeletal infections are notoriously difficult to treat, requiring long-term antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement of necrotic bone and surrounding tissue. Despite proper infection management, the recurrence rate of osteomyelitis is around 30 percent, one year post-treatment. This treatment difficulty is exacerbated by widespread antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus both in the hospital and community settings, and by significant pathogen-induced bone destruction, which limits antibiotic penetration to the infectious focus. It is therefore clear that there is an overwhelming need for improved treatment options of S. aureus musculoskeletal infections. This proposal seeks to address this gap in treatment by understanding how S. aureus regulates virulence responses and metabolic adaptations to the skeletal environment to reveal novel therapeutic targets.  In order to discover the genetic programs that accommodate bacterial survival in the skeletal environment, an unbiased, genome-wide approach known as transposon sequencing (TnSeq) was used, which identified the S. aureus two-component system SrrAB as essential for sustaining invasive osteomyelitis. SrrAB is known to regulate the aerobic/anaerobic shift and modulate toxin production. These characteristics are especially important in bone, which is an intrinsically hypoxic tissue and is sensitive to pathogen-induced bone destruction. Intriguingly, preliminary data indicate that SrrAB also regulates nutrient utilization programs. The ability of SrrAB to modulate nutrient utilization may be particularly important during osteomyelitis, as resident bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts exhibit a specialized metabolism requiring elevated glucose uptake, thereby limiting carbon availability to S. aureus during osteomyelitis. Accordingly, this proposal will investigate the SrrAB-dependent mechanisms by which S. aureus regulates virulence responses and metabolic adaptations to the hypoxic skeletal environment. The proposed Aims will test these hypotheses to determine (1) the mechanism of SrrAB control of toxin production in response to hypoxic growth and (2) the regulation of nutrient utilization by SrrAB that supports S. aureus growth in hypoxic skeletal tissues. Completion of the proposed experiments will elucidate microbial strategies of virulence regulation and nutrient acquisition during infection. These findings will have applications to antimicrobial and anti-virulence therapy development by furthering our understanding of the regulation of basic microbial processes essential for survival during invasive infection."
"9418922","ABSTRACT ? Research Pilot Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide, yet there are pronounced differences in incidence and mortality between racial/ethnic groups. Hispanics/Latinas (H/L) are a growing and understudied group characterized by a variable admixture of European, Indigenous American, and African ancestry. Breast cancer is genetically and biologically heterogeneous, consisting of multiple molecular subtypes which differ in terms of prognosis and response to treatment. The PAM50 gene expression panel distinguishes five main intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer: Luminal A, Luminal B (both ER?-positive), Her2/Neu enriched, Basal-like and Normal-like. The Luminal B subtype has a poorer prognosis than Luminal A, lower expression of nuclear hormone receptors, and higher expression of proliferation markers. These tumors benefit less from endocrine therapy, and remain the largest cause of breast cancer mortality. In a cohort of 301 clinically annotated H/L breast cancer patients, we found that among mixed-ancestry Hispanic/Latina patients, the frequency of Luminal B tumors is remarkably high (>42%). Among these H/L patients, Luminal B tumors are characterized by a more aggressive clinical presentation than Luminal A tumors, suggesting that the high frequency of Luminal B tumors is associated with a strong health outcomes disparity. A higher incidence of Luminal B tumors has been reported among US H/L patients, but the number of H/L in the study was too small to draw definite conclusions. Using RNASeq, we found that H/L Luminal B tumors are frequently characterized by increased expression of the ERBB2 (Her2/Neu) receptor, the GRB7 adaptor and the migration and invasion enhancer, MIEN1. Expression of these three genes was linked to Indigenous American (IA) ancestry and all are located at Ch17q12. ERBB2 and GRB7 are co-amplified in Her2/Neu enriched tumors, and are correlated with endocrine resistance and poor prognosis in ER?-positive tumors. A link between genetic ancestry and Luminal B breast cancer can help identify prognostic biomarkers as well as molecular features for specific therapeutic approaches (precision medicine) in H/L. Our primary hypothesis is that H/L ethnicity/IA ancestry are associated with a high incidence of Luminal B tumors and with increased expression of ERBB2, GRB7 and MIEN1. Furthermore, we propose that the elevated expression of these three genes may be the consequence of altered promoter or enhancer methylation linked to IA ancestry. To test these ideas, we will examine a novel cohort of H/L breast cancer patients in two specific aims: (1) to determine the molecular portraits of PAM50- confirmed Luminal B tumors from H/L breast cancer patients utilizing RNASeq, and to correlate these findings with clinicopathological parameters and outcomes, and (2) to establish the relationship of ERBB2, GRB7 and MIEN1 with promoter methylation, ancestry, clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes."
"9357555","ABSTRACT There is an urgent, unmet clinical need to develop non-invasive approaches for distinguishing benign vs. malignant indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPN) identified on CT chest. We propose to develop and validate integrated clinical, molecular and imaging-based diagnostic models of lung cancer in smokers with nodules 6- 25 mm who are at elevated risk of lung cancer as a result of meeting eligibility criteria for screening, and whose nodules may have been screen-detected or incidentally-detected in routine clinical practice. This nodule size range represents an intermediate risk for disease for which there is the greatest clinical uncertainty in terms of diagnostic management. The investigators at BU have developed and validated a gene expression biomarker, recently launched commercially as a CLIA assay (PerceptaTM) measured in cytologically-normal mainstem bronchus epithelium with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value (NPV) for detecting lung cancer among smokers undergoing bronchoscopy for suspect lung cancer. They have recently extended these cancer-specific molecular alterations within the ?field of injury? to develop and validate a similar biomarker in less invasively collected nasal epithelium. Additionally, investigators at UCLA have identified both qualitative and quantitative imaging features that inform diagnostic risk in both screen- and incidentally-detected nodules in older smokers. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will refine qualitative and quantitative imaging biomarkers, confirm their reproducibility, and determine their contribution to diagnostic models in individuals with nodules 6- 25 mm from the CT arm of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Aim 2 will determine whether bronchial gene expression biomarkers originally validated in high risk cohorts perform equally well in the specific context of patients with IPNs 6-25 mm undergoing bronchoscopy as part of the Detection of Early Lung Cancer Among Military Personnel (DECAMP) consortium, as well as integrate this biomarker with imaging-based markers from Aim 1. Given that not all IPN patients undergo bronchoscopy, Aim 2 will also validate a recently developed nasal gene-expression biomarker in this same cohort and construct models that integrate clinical, imaging, and molecular biomarkers. In Aim 3, the integrated clinical, nasal gene-expression and imaging-based biomarker will then be validated prospectively in multiple cohorts with screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs who are undergoing CT surveillance or biopsy. Our working hypothesis is that diagnostic models that integrate orthogonal feature sets of molecular biomarkers, clinical variables, and imaging features will provide the highest discrimination between benign and malignant IPNs in the 6-25 mm size range in which diagnostic uncertainty is greatest. Given the increasingly widespread implementation of lung cancer screening and dramatically increased numbers of IPNs, we anticipate that sensitive biomarkers with a high NPV would enable physicians to avoid unnecessary procedures in patients with benign disease of the lung, avoiding their associated medical risks and economic costs.

The Clinical Core will leverage access to two unique sources of patient material: 1) the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus (RRNL), which provides a rare opportunity to study asymptomatic women at risk for developing SLE who are identified to have anti-Ro antibodies solely based on the diagnosis of neonatal lupus in an offspring; 2) the NYU Lupus Cohort, a large well-characterized prospective multiracial/ethnic cohort; and 3) healthy controls age, ethnically/racially, and gender matched to subjects. The Clinical Core will provide detailed phenotypic analysis of these two cohorts by linking clinical data inclusive of validated disease activity and flare instruments specific to Lupus to precisely define timing of flares and remissions with biologic inquiries related to genetics, the microbiome, B and T cells, and autoantibody profiles. These goals will be accomplished via three specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will develop and maintain a clinical database and linked sample repository comprised of mothers enrolled in the RRNL and a prospectively followed cohort of subjects with overt SLE. Clinical data will be matched with subject blood and stool samples (specific to the needs of the Research Projects), which will be stored and maintained by the Clinical Core. Specific Aim 2 will establish a workflow for the delivery of specimens and linked clinical data to investigators in Projects 1, 2, and 3 with sample procurement coordinated to provide both fresh and stored specimens driven by the research protocols. Specific Aim 3 will incorporate appropriate statistical resources to perform analyses correlating research data with matched clinical data. It is anticipated that the Clinical Core will provide an unprecedented platform upon which state-of-the-art technologies can be applied to precisely phenotyped and longitudinally followed cohorts. "

"9462412","ABSTRACT Simple protein mutations can have serious consequences by causing diseases that affect people's lives. Protein therapeutics are developed to target and replace those protein mutations, and essentially to heal the disease. Distinctively, membrane proteins make up over 60% of today's drug targets. However, cumbersome, time- consuming, and often ineffectual purification methods have hampered membrane protein purification and downstream experimentation. The long-term objective of this application is to develop a rapid and simplified method for enhanced expression and tailoring purification to each specific membrane protein; this would greatly enhance commercial opportunities for this important therapeutic sector. The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is commonly used for production of proteins for structure- function studies, vaccines and therapeutics, but membrane proteins are often poorly expressed and difficult to purify. ParaTechs (www.ParaTechs.com) currently markets insect cells and vectors that provide heightened expression of foreign genes due to delayed lysis and increased overall health of infected cells. This proposal seeks to expand our baculovirus product line through the development of this innovative tool by combining the vankyrin-enhanced baculovirus expression vector system with a novel fluorescent fusion tag that will aid the expression and solubilization of membrane proteins. Aim one is to design baculovirus transfer vectors and viruses harboring both the vankyrin gene and membrane proteins fused to the novel fluorescent tag. The second aim will evaluate the stability of the fluorescent tag in the detergents selected for the solubilization screen. Aim three of this application will compare the efficiency and efficacy of membrane protein expression and purification using a new solubilization screen that is compatible with the recombinant baculoviruses produced in the first aim. The here developed fluorescent selection technology will allow enhanced functional protein production, rapid identification of detergents that enable successful solubilization, and easy optimization of protein purification conditions. This innovative technology will overcome two major barriers in the development of protein therapeutics, namely the expression of large quantities of pure, properly processed membrane proteins and to solubilize active proteins from membranes."
"9370323","The essential function of the Clinical Core is to provide prospectively collected, longitudinal clinical data and  associated biosamples on a well-characterized cohort of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients. This clinical data  will be linked by date to the biologic specimens essential to the completion of the projects. The Clinical Core  will build on two existing, dedicated Scleroderma Center longitudinal SSc patient cohorts at the University of  Pittsburgh and Boston University Medical Center in order to accomplish this goal. These observational cohorts  will enroll consecutive SSc patients presenting to each institution. Cohort databases will be combined in the  UPMC Rheumatic Disease Data Management System (RDMS). Blood samples for serum, plasma and PBMC  RNA will be obtained at clinical visits, and linked to clinical data to support all projects. Skin biopsies will be  collected from patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc for single cell RNA-seq and development of a prognostic  skin biomarker (Project #1). Catheter tips from patients undergoing right heart catheterization and associated  clinical information, including right heart hemodynamics, will be collected to characterize endothelial cells from  SSc patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (Project #2). In specific aim 1 the Clinical Core will continue  collecting clinical data and harmonize data collection in a two-center observational, clinical data repository of  SSc patients, supporting Projects #1, #2 and #3. This clinical data will be collected prospectively at each SSc  Center clinic visit. Clinical data will be available corresponding to the time of SSc patient tissue or blood  sample ascertainment. Clinical data will include medical history, SSc-related symptoms, physical examination,  objective testing and patient reported outcomes (PROs). In specific aim 2 the core will provide blood, skin and  pulmonary vascular biospecimens, accompanied by full SSc-associated autoantibody gold standard testing for  Projects #1, #2 and #3. The Clinical Core will facilitate linking the clinical data in either cross-sectional (such as  first SSc clinic visit) or longitudinal fashion, and thus examine whether project mechanistic findings (protein or  mRNA levels) correlate with longitudinal disease assessments (pharmacodynamic biomarkers), or with the  change in disease from the initial biological assessment (prognostic biomarkers). The UPMC Scleroderma  Center is the only dedicated SSc Center that has historically been able to complete all gold standard SSc-  associated autoantibody testing. Thus, the Clinical Core will help project investigators to assess the  relationship between the patients' autoantibody status, and clinical and biological outcomes. In specific aim 3  the Clinical Core will provide project investigators in Projects #1, #2 and #3 with the statistical support  necessary to investigate associations between the clinical data with the proposed mechanistic and prognostic  analyses of all three Projects."
"9547564","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although it has been known for millennia that many young women who give birth vaginally will suffer from disabling pelvic organ prolapse later in their lifespan, the factors linking these two events remain a mystery. Of the 3 million women who deliver vaginally each year 300,000 or 1 in 10 will later require surgery for pelvic floor dysfunction due to their unique sex-determined role in reproduction. Our discovery of birth-induced levator ani muscle injury and its strong relationship to prolapse has identified a key connection between birth and prolapse. Ignorance of how birth-induced injury occurs and how it produces subsequent prolapse has blocked efforts to improve prevention and treatment. In this application we seek to continue SCOR support for our broadly interdisciplinary sex-differences research group representing 4 schools and 2 institutes. The group has won 10 awards in the last 4 years for our discoveries and now seeks funding to begin to translate these insights into improved prevention at birth and strategies for better treatment. Project I Birth Biomechanics will test hypotheses concerning basic mechanisms of levator ani injury during vaginal birth to identify specific situations that may increase or decrease injury risk. Project II Injury Extensio will determine whether minor clinically insignificant levator injury after first birth extends to a  clinically significant tear during second birth. Because a second birth doubles the risk of genital prolapse, this event offers the opportunity of preventing injury and their sequelae later in life. Project III Muscle-Ligament Dynamics will establish the interaction between birth-related levator muscle injury and the properties of the uterovaginal supporting ligaments associated with prolapse. Core A Administrative/Human Subjects integrates and supports the interdisciplinary team and provides project support by recruiting subjects, compiling and analyzing data and protecting subject safety. Core B Biostatistics/Measurements provides statistical and technical support for the projects along with integrated analysis for 2- and 3-dimensional spatial data gathered across projects. It will prepare data for presentation, publication, subject safety analysis and eventually public use.  Core C Translation/Mentorshipw\\\ foster insight dissemination and drive investigator development. This SCOR will produce translational insights to reduce the sex-determined consequences women suffer from their unique role in reproduction. It will establish the scientific basis for new strategies to improve treatment, identify important prevention opportunities, and train a new generation of researchers."
"9314537","SUMMARY Core B will provide database infrastructure and coordinate data deposition to public resources such as INSDC (the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration), as well as coordinate the data for the project overall to facilitate comparison with other datasets and deployment of advanced algorithms. It will build on the Knight lab's extensive experience with meta-analysis, sequence databases, and data visualization to provide these methods to Project 1, Project 2, and Project 3, and will work closely with Core A to mirror metabolomics data and integrate metabolomics datasets with the rest of the multi-omic data to be collected. Core B has three Aims. Aim 1-organize the data and metadata collected in Project 1 from mice and Project 2 from humans, curate these datasets, and ensure that analyses are reproducible in an automated fashion using virtual machines. Aim 2-deposit the data and metadata in standards-compliant form to INSDC, the Gene Expression Omnibus, and other resources (e.g., metabolomics repositories) as they emerge. Aim 3-Through analyses of existing microbiome datasets, provide best-practices recommendations to investigators in Project 1 and Project 2 to optimize experimental design. Core B will build on an extensive multi-omics data repository funded by multiple sources that is able to accommodate the types of data to be collected in the project overall, including links between human subjects with defined family relationships (e.g. dizygotic twins), humanized gnotobiotic mice colonized with strains derived from these human subjects, timeseries study designs in both humans and mice, combinations of data at multiple levels including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, RNA-Seq, and metabolomics, and other advanced features of this complex project. A key component of our approach is to enable investigators in the laboratory collecting the datasets to perform their own first-pass analyses while at the same time making the data available more broadly within the project for additional advanced analyses, such as those being developed in Project 3, to be applied, and also making the data available to the public in a relatively user-friendly form to supplement public deposition in permanent government-backed sequence data repositories."
"9379711","Voltage-gated proton channels (HV1) are phylogenetically diverse, being distributed from unicellular marine life to humans. They have uniquely small unitary conductance but are perfectly selectivity for protons, which is essential considering the low H+ concentration in cells. HV1 channels are voltage activated and their voltage dependence is strongly regulated by the transmembrane pH gradient ( ), so that they extrude acid from cells. The HV1 channel protein is strikingly similar to the voltage-sensing domain of voltage-gated K+ and Na+ ?pH channels. Mammalian HV1 channels are dimers with a conduction pathway through each protomer (incredibly these gate cooperatively!). HV1 functions in humans are diverse, including phagocyte bacteria killing, airway pH regulation, basophil histamine release, sperm maturation, and B lymphocyte responses. Elevated HV1 expression exacerbates chronic lymphocytic leukemia, breast, and colon cancer metastasis, and contributes to brain damage from ischemic stroke. Indeed, recognition of the clinical importance of HV1 channels is rapidly expanding. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms that control HV channel function remain poorly understood. This makes development of rational HV1 channel targeted therapeutic interventions mechanistically blind and thus nearly impossible. Only one crystal structure exists (of a presumed closed state), and it has suspected flaws due to its being a chimera. Thus, the exposed parts of the channel (i.e. those assessable by aqueous therapeutics), especially when open, are very poorly defined. To overcome this knowledge barrier, we will identify clinically pertinent structure-functional attributes of HV1 gating and pH sensing using a combination of state-of-the-art electrophysiology, molecular biology, and protein biochemistry. We will test the following overall hypothesis: The clinically relevant pH sensing, permeation, and gating mechanisms of the H channel are functionally linked via multiple protonatable groups, V1 providing a redundancy that safeguards the essential physiological function of proton channels. By addressing this hypothesis our aims will systematically establish a strong mechanistic foundation that defines possible points of therapeutic intervention.  In Aim 1 we will determine the molecular mechanism that couples transmembrane pH gradient and HV1 channel gating. The unique ?pH dependence of gating is the single most important property of the HV1 channel and is central to all known HV1 functions, yet has eluded all efforts to understand its mechanism. Experiments will be guided by three novel mechanistic models that involve charges in the protein and protonation sites. By identifying the correct pH sensing mechanism, critical molecular components can be located.  Aim 2 focuses on understanding the gating mechanism of HV1, especially the location and solvent accessibility of residues in closed and open channels. We will study mutants with unique gating properties; model closed, intermediate, and open states using molecular dynamics (MD); and evaluate the role of dimerization in the responses of HV1 in phagocytes, sperm, and other cells. Identifying the key parts of the molecule involved in gating will enable regulating channel opening in health and disease."
"9353286","Project Summary  Congenital myopathies (CM) are a heterogeneous collection of disorders defined by early onset hypotonia. Some myopathies can progress to extreme conditions in which patients develop respiratory complications and even require assistance for mobility. Mutations in genes associated with actin dynamics have been identified in patients with CMs, including Tropomyosins. We found that Drosophila Tropomyosin 2 (Tm2) directs embryonic skeletal muscle development by promoting myoblast fusion, myotube elongation, and sarcomere assembly. These surprising results argue that defects in myofiber development contribute to the clinical phenotypes associated with CMs.  There remain critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of skeletal muscle development. In particular, nascent myotubes must elongate and attach to the appropriate tendon cells to form a functional contractile unit. However, the molecules that guide myotubes to their muscle attachment sites remain largely unknown. In addition, the mechanisms by which myotubes respond to chemotactic signals are unclear. We have used forward genetic screens and cutting edge transcriptional profiling to identify myotube guidance molecules and intracellular effectors of myotube elongation. Our preliminary work has generated unique genetic tools and novel mechanistic insights that will allow us to characterize the central pathways and mechanisms that direct myotube elongation. The overall hypothesis for this application is that filopodia are the key effectors of myotube pathfinding, and that filopodial behavior is dictated by external pathfinding cues, intracellular protein kinases, and actin regulatory proteins. This project will achieve the following aims: (1) define the cellular pathways by which Tropomyosin regulates myogenesis, (2) characterize novel intracellular effectors of myotube pathfinding, and (3) characterize chemotactic mechanisms that direct myotube pathfinding. These studies will make substantial inroads into an emerging area of muscle biology that has the potential to uncover novel mechanisms that contribute to muscle disease."
"9408357","Applied Separations Inc. proposes to develop a competitively priced liquid CO2 flash chromatography system that will rapidly separate compounds with high resolution and significantly reduce organic solvent consumption. Pharmaceutical companies annually synthesize thousands of compounds in drug discovery laboratories in an attempt to find new drug molecules for commercialization. Each of these synthesized compounds may require many reaction and purification steps for further testing. The primary technique used in the pharmaceutical industry to purify these compounds is flash chromatography and it is preferred because of high sample loading capacity and ease of use. Unfortunately, existing flash chromatography instrumentation suffers from poor peak resolution and uses large volumes of organic solvents as the mobile phase in the separation. Within medicinal chemistry laboratories, flash chromatography is the main source of chemical waste. Applied Separations developed a Phase I prototype liquid CO2 flash chromatography system that successfully used liquid CO2 as a replacement for non polar organic solvent mobile phases. The instrument rapidly separated test compounds with increased compound resolution, significant solvent reduction and good compound recoveries. The specific aims of this Phase II proposal are to: (1) redesign the instrument based on the evaluation of the prototype and optimize the instrument components for reliability, serviceability, and assembly. (2) redesign software to improve usability including the computer interface and the integration of the solvent pump and CO2 software modules. (3) develop proprietary cartridges and vessels that are hand tightened and easy to use with superior chromatography. (4) Finally, construct two optimized liquid flash chromatographs for beta testing at biotechnology and drug discovery laboratories before the final design is locked."
"9373273","This application is for a K01 Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity in Biomedical Research. Dr. Trevejo-Nunez will investigate the role of IL-22/ IL-22RA2 during pneumococcal pneumonia. In United States, pneumococcal pneumonia (lung infection caused by S. pneumoniae) accounts for significant percentage of morbidity and mortality. The most vulnerable population are children younger than 2 years old and individuals older than 65.  The candidate has data that shows IL-22 signaling in the liver is important for control of pneumococcal pneumonia and that treatment with the cytokine IL-22 improves bacterial burden. The overall hypothesis is that enhancement of IL-22 signaling, through therapeutic administration of IL-22 or absence of decoy recptor IL-22RA2, favors bacterial clearance and host survival by sustaining the levels of STAT3 activation in lung epithelium and liver during in pneumococcal pneumonia. To test this hypothesis, the candidate proposes 1) Define the lung cellular sources of endogenous decoy receptor IL-22RA2 in the uninfected hosts and during pneumococcal pneumonia. 2) Test the prediction that enhanced IL-22RA1 signaling in target tissues controls bacterial burden during pneumococcal pneumonia. 3) Test the prediction that enhanced IL-22 signaling results in sustained STAT-3 activation imdependent of gp130/SOCS3 in lung epithelium and liver.  Dr. Trevejo-Nunez is Postdoctoral Associate of Pediatrics/ Instructor of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. She proposes a career development plan that focuses on: one- to- one meetings with her mentor Dr. Jay Kolls every week, learning mouse model of infection using transgenic and conditional knockout mice, attending academic coursework to strengthen her foundation in immunology, statistics, experimental design and grant writing; participating in responsible conduct of research workshops, meeting with her review advisory committee every 6 months, attending conferences and publishing manuscripts as first author. Dr. Trevejo-Nunez's long term goal is to become an independent physician- scientist with particular expertise in the immunology and host response against S. pneumoniae lung infection. The candidate also plans to gather enough information and analysis of data to apply for R01 funding at the end of this award."
"9560415","PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with gastroparesis often suffer with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms that are not adequately treated due to both a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and lack of effective treatments. The participation of Temple University as a clinical center in the NIDDK Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium and the proposed studies will help achieve the broad, long term objectives of improving the understanding and treatment of patients with gastroparesis. The PI and Temple University are well qualified to continue to be one of the clinical centers in this consortium. Temple University has clinical expertise and an active research program in the evaluation and treatment of patients with gastroparesis. The aims for this renewal of the Gastroparesis Consortium are threefold. First, to better understand the pathologic basis of gastroparesis by continuing to provide gastric full thickness biopsy specimens from patients with gastroparesis. We are now collecting specimens from the antrum and obtaining freshly frozen tissue for RNA expression. Second, to better understand the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of patients with symptoms of gastroparesis by maintaining and expanding the Gastroparesis Registry. Our goal is to have four years of follow-up on patients which will require maintenance of the Registry and continued periodic follow-up visits. We propose to continue recruitment of new patients. Refinements to existing questionnaires and pathophysiologic measures, as well as new ones, will allow us to answer questions related to the pathogenesis, severity grading, complications, treatment responses, and clinical outcomes in patients with gastroparesis. Third, to conduct new multicenter studies of gastroparesis investigating the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Our application proposes three studies, each aimed at the understanding of the pathophysiology of symptoms and treatment of symptoms from gastroparesis. Improved testing will better associate pathophysiology with gastroparesis symptoms and ultimately enable targeted therapy to the underlying gastric pathophysiologic abnormality. Our first study will determine the effect of the 5HT-1 receptor agonist, buspirone, on early satiety and intragastric meal distribution in patients with symptoms of gastroparesis. Our second study is an evaluation of abdominal pain in gastroparesis, determining the prevalence of and response to treatment for chronic pancreatitis. Finally, our third study will assess the clinical outcome of patients undergoing endoscopic pyloromyotomy for gastroparesis, looking at the response and predictive factors for clinical improvement with this novel treatment. These three studies will ultimately enable physicians to better target therapy to the underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities in patients with gastroparesis. Temple's participation in the NIH Gastroparesis Clinical Consortium and the undertaking of Temple's proposed studies will help achieve the goal of the consortium by advancing our understanding of the pathophysiology and developing appropriate treatments for patients with symptomatic gastroparesis."
"9310631","Structural Transitions in Proteins and Protein Assemblies Project Summary/Abstract A detailed knowledge of the relation between chemical composition and structure/function of proteins is crucial for an understanding of disease pathways and the working of drugs at the level of cells. De- spite decades of research, both experimental and computational, this relationship is still only partially understood. In the present project, we develop advanced computational methodologies to investigate structural changes that are dif?cult to probe in experiments, but are important because they change the function of proteins, or the toxicity of protein aggregates. These techniques are tested and opti- mized in studies of two proteins, RfaH-CTD and lymphotactin, that change their function by switching between two different structures. While focusing on simple model systems, the gained insight may guide therapeutic applications, for instance, the design of components that stabilize a certain confor- mation. In a second set of simulations we extend our techniques and concepts to the oligomerization of amyloid-forming A -peptides, implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Combining our computational studies with experimental investigations by the Rangachari Lab at University of Southern Mississippi, we will study the transition between toxic and non-toxic (or less toxic) aggregates, and why some amyloids can seed their own growth by converting other forms. Understanding this process may in turn lead to the development of drugs that modulate the spread of such ?infectious strains?."
"9411797","SUMMARY  Approximately 1110 non-redundant sequence families and therefore potentially distinct folds for ?- helical integral membrane proteins (MPs) are represented in sequence databases. At the same time less than 100 distinct MP folds have been deposited in the protein data bank (PDB). Thus, for around 1000 ?-helical MP families at least one structure remains to be determined to unambiguously assign a fold. While more than 50% of all drugs target MPs it remains difficult to obtain high-quality crystals of MPs, even though there has been spectacular progress in this area in recent years. Even if a MP can be crystallized, not all functional states might be represented, ensemble states are badly represented by static snapshots, and the model might be perturbed by crystallization aides. Alternative experimental techniques such as NMR and EPR spectroscopy can result in structural restraints for MPs. However, datasets typically remain sparse and are affiliated with an error margin. This sparseness of data leads to an increased demand for computational methods to integrate sparse data from multiple technologies and supplement missing experimental information.  Here we propose development of a MP structure determination algorithm integrated in the BioChemical software Library (BCL) ?BCL::MP-Fold? with the following highlights: a) Sparseness of experimental data is counter-balanced by integrating multiple experimental approaches with knowledge-based potentials. b) The absence of suitable templates for many MPs is addressed through a de novo folding algorithm. c) The size and complexity limits of current computational methods are circumvented via initial assembly of disconnected sec- ondary structure elements (SSEs) in the trans-membrane region. d) The computational effort is complemented by a paramagnetic tagging strategy including non-natural amino acids to yield NMR and EPR restraints, that overcome limitations of cysteine labeling strategies, circumvent the tedious and error-prone assignment of NMR signals to side chain atoms, and are especially well suited for use in BCL::MP-Fold. Ultimately, BCL::MP-FOLD will help to determine the structure of protonated EmrE, a homo-dimeric ?-helical MP with four trans-membrane spans per protamer. The protonated state of EmrE is an important interme- diate in the transport cycle of the small multidrug transporter with a yet to be determine three- dimensional structure."
"9564517","ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish a Coordinating Center (CC) for the next phase of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) sponsored by the NIH. The objective of ATN is to increase awareness among at-risk youth of their HIV status and, for those with HIV, achieve linkage, engagement and retention in the care continuum. Many challenges are faced by adolescents during their transition to young adulthood, resulting from developmental changes, peer influences, identity, and self-esteem formation. Risky behaviors among adolescents, which include engaging in unprotected sexual encounters or sharing nonsterile injecting drug paraphernalia, increase their likelihood of acquiring HIV infection. In the 2013 US Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBSS), 34% of US high school students reported sexual intercourse during the prior 3 months, of which only 59% indicated condom use during last sexual intercourse. The YRBSS also found that only 13% of students had ever been tested for HIV infection. Given the global burden of new HIV infections among young people, greater involvement of adolescents in biomedical and behavioral HIV research is essential. However, significant individual, operational, and community-level barriers have been recognized to engaging adolescents in clinical prevention trials, which include insufficient understanding of research, need for parental consent, lack of access, mistrust and stigma associated with research participation. The new ATN is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating U19 investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for ATN projects. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies, comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include ATN information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to ATN by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the ATN. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for collaboration and extraordinary research productivity from protocol development through research data sharing."
"9539784","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection, viral eradication is not achievable due to the persistence of latently-infected cells during treatment. ART must therefore be taken on a lifelong basis. Accumulating data suggest that HIV- infected individuals often experience persistent immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and accelerated aging even in the setting of ART-mediated viral suppression. These realities have created a pronounced interest in developing strategies to eradicate HIV in infected individuals. Identifying host determinants governing viral latency and reservoir size in vivo will be critical in developing effective strategies to clear the latent reservoir and cure HIV infection. Several cell-intrinsic immune factors have been discovered that restrict HIV infection in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. We recently demonstrated that the elevated expression of two particular restriction factors, p21 (inhibitor of HIV transcription) and schlafen 11 (codon usage-based inhibitor of HIV protein synthesis), was strongly associated with decreased HIV latent reservoir size in ART-suppressed individuals. We further demonstrated that select cell-intrinsic immune responses were enhanced in subjects who initiated ART during early versus chronic infection, likely contributing to the reduced reservoir size observed in these individuals. In this R01 project, we will extend our in vivo observations by performing single cell-level analyses, as well as ex vivo and in vitro experiments to characterize the effects of select host restriction factors on the establishment and reversal of HIV latency. In Aim 1, we will apply novel PCR-Activated Cell Sorting (PACS) technology to clinical samples from HIV-infected, ART-suppressed individuals to interrogate single CD4+ T cells for the presence of HIV DNA and RNA. We will then measure the expression of p21 and schlafen 11 in single cells harboring transcriptionally active and inactive proviruses to elucidate the role of these factors in regulating viral latency. In Aim 2, w will use lentiviral transduction to overexpress and silence select cell- intrinsic immune factors i primary cells and human lymphoid aggregate cultures (HLAC). A dual-reporter HIV construct will then be used to examine the effects of these cell-intrinsic immune factors on the establishment of latent HIV infection. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will manipulate p21 and schlafen 11 expression in a cell line model of HIV latency and in HIV-infected primary cells. Cells will then be treated with a comprehensive panel of latency reversal agents, to examine the effects of p21 and schlafen 11 manipulation on the efficacy of these agents and on the dynamics of viral reactivation. This study will yield valuable insights into how cell-intrinsic immunity may serve as a foundation of novel curative strategies for HIV infection."

This multidisciplinary symposium intends to bring together experts from academia and medical devices industry working on electronic, chemical, biological and mechanical aspects of the interaction between the synthetic devices and neural tissues. Invited talks showcasing applications of specific materials properties to neuronal monitoring and  ?functional devices. As materials design for neural interfaces manipulation will promote the discussion between the members of the community inspiring the future development of multi-- is closely coupled to areas of bioengineering as well as developing treatments for neurological disorders, we believe that this symposium addresses the scientific mission of both the NIBIB and NINDS.  Synopsis. Mammalian nervous system contains billions neurons and glia connected into intricate networks through a variety of chemical, electrical, and mechanical signals. Disruptions to inter-cellular and inter-regional communication within the nervous system often lead to debilitating neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Parkinson's disease or major depression. To understand the complexity of neural signaling and develop therapeutic approaches to the diseases of the nervous system, neural interface devices have been under investigation for the past 30 years. Neural tissues, however, possess low elastic moduli that are in stark contrast with traditional wafer-built electronics. This mismatch often leads to foreign body response following implantation. It has been recently recognized that the design of an interface between the brain and a synthetic sensor is a materials science problem. The Symposium BM8: Materials Design for Neural Interfaces will discuss the recent progress in development of flexible and organic electronics, and bio- and nanomaterials aimed at creating multifunctional and minimally invasive probes. The symposium will also highlight the advances in materials chemistry that have enabled novel imaging approaches such as tissue clearing techniques and synthetic activity indicators allowing not only to probe the dynamics but understand the structure of neural pathways. The result of our symposium will be a roadmap of future materials-driven neural interface research."
"9560999","PROGRAM PLANNING AND EVALUATION  Project Summary/Abstract  The significant progress of the Simmons Cancer Center over the four years since award of the center's  inaugural CCSG has been a direct result of effective use of internal and external planning and evaluation  processes that have engaged the Cancer Center membership and UT Southwestern Medical Center  leadership. Planning and evaluation activities are organized into three categories: an External Advisory Board,  internal planning and review, and program development.  External Advisory Board. The Simmons Cancer Center has received strong guidance from an External  Advisory Board that includes outstanding scientists and leaders with NCI-designated cancer center experience.  As the Simmons Cancer Center has evolved, new expertise has been added to the EAB. The board meets  annually in Dallas to review scientific programs, shared resources, and research thrusts. Individual members of  the EAB visit to provide guidance on specific topics or programmatic initiatives. The board reviews the  productivity, excellence, and cancer focus of each scientific program and makes recommendation regarding  opportunities for recruitment to address gaps in the program as well as on strategies to further enable the  success of a growing cancer center. Institutional leadership participates in the review and receives reports  each year.  Internal planning and evaluation. The Senior Leaders Council oversees the planning and evaluation for the  center and is supported by a series of committees, including a monthly meeting of program leaders and  disease-oriented team members who convene with the senior leaders. The center engages membership in a  highly successful and popular center-wide retreat held annually.

"9450909","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The polymorphic fungus, Candida albicans is part of the endogenous human mycobiota. It colonizes mucosal surfaces of 30-70% of healthy individuals. The fungus causes both superficial mucosal diseases and life threatening invasive infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) causes significant morbidity in a large and diverse population of patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, Sjogren's syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cancer of the head and neck, or the use of steroids Nearly 10 million cases of HIV/AIDS associated OPC occur annually and nearly one fifth of these cases have esophageal involvement. To cause OPC, C. albicans must adhere to and invade the oral mucosa, and resist being killed by host phagocytes. Dr. Swidergall discovered that EphA2 on oral epithelial cells and neutrophils is a novel pattern recognition receptor for C. albicans. EphA2 binds exposed ?-glucan on the fungal cell walls, and the preliminary data indicate that it plays a key role in the response of both epithelial cells and neutrophils to the organism.  The central objective of this proposal is to determine how the ?-glucan receptor EphA2 interacts with other host signaling molecules to induce an inflammatory response in both the oral mucosa and leukocytes, and induce oral epithelial cell invasion during OPC. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of EphA2 activation and downstream signaling in oral epithelial cells during oral C. albicans infection in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2 will characterize the mechanisms by which EphA2 activation triggers neutrophil fungicidal activity. The long-term goal of this research is to determine how host receptors recognize invading fungi and maintain mucosal immunity so that new drugs and strategies to treat and prevent fungal diseases can be developed.  The candidate, Dr. Swidergall, has a longstanding interest in mycology research. After completing the mentored phase of this K99, his goal is to become an assistant professor at a leading academic research institute, where he plans to continue his research on the role of critical host cell receptors in the pathogenesis of OPC. He also plans to teach students and train future scientists. This K99/R00 proposal is designed to complement Dr. Swidergall's prior research training and provide him with the necessary technical and intellectual expertise to become an independent investigator. The training he will receive in the K99 phase will substantially enhance his career prospects, and make him highly competitive for faculty positions in top research institutes. Dr. Swidergall's primary mentor, Dr. Scott G. Filler, and co-mentor, Dr. Michail S. Lionakis, were carefully selected for their relevant, diverse, and complementary expertise to cover all elements of his proposal. In addition, Dr. Swidergall has assembled an advisory committee of a diverse group of scientists to oversee his scientific progression and career development during his transition to an independent investigator. All members of this committee are senior scientists with extensive experience in mentoring postdocs."
"9431595","Dysregulated social and emotional processing is a debilitating issue across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, major depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. These disorders not only have severe impacts on individual well being but also represent a tremendous economic burden on the U.S. Since social and emotional disruptions often co-occur, a key question is how social processing neurons are intertwined with or embedded in positive and negative valence systems. This interplay is likely important to link social contexts with emotional representations and promote motivation. However, the precise functional neural circuitry that orchestrates these complex interactions remains unresolved and it is unclear whether social and nonsocial emotional information is processed through overlapping or distinct pathways. Recent technological developments have made it possible to combine calcium imaging and miniature epifluorescence microscopes to visualize the natural activity dynamics of individual neurons with anatomical and molecular precision, on a large scale in freely behaving animals. The goal of this proposed K99/R00 research is to use these approaches, in conjunction with in vivo optogenetic strategies, to chronically monitor and acutely manipulate the activity of precise neural circuits during social and nonsocial behaviors in mice. In particular, this project will focus on circuitry that connects the medial preoptic area (mPOA), an essential site for social behavior across mammals, with midbrain dopaminergic neurons that regulate motivational states. Activity-dependent monosynaptic tracing and combined optogenetic imaging approaches will also elucidate how salient sensory cues are transmitted to mPOA-midbrain circuits to adjust social and emotional states. Completion of the proposed aims is expected to be impactful because these studies will illuminate the causal and natural neural dynamics that underlie social and nonsocial emotional behavior. While the mesolimbic dopamine system has been well implicated in adaptive and maladaptive reward processing, it is unknown whether social motivation deficits are due to perturbations in specialized social pathways or due to more generalized reward disruptions. Identifying how these processes interact at the individual neuron level is of critical importance because without this information, we are unlikely to discover the ways in which certain social and nonsocial behavioral abnormalities arise. This career development award will provide the candidate with the technical training, conceptual background, and mentorship from renowned experts within the field. Ultimately, this training will uniquely position this young investigator to transition to an independent research program focused on investigating social and nonsocial emotional deficits that are common to many mental health disorders."
"9379194","Abstract Bipolar disorder (BD) is a frequently devastating psychiatric illness that is challenging to diagnose and treat. Identifying the underlying mechanisms of this illness may provide a foundation for better evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. For the first time in the context of psychiatric illness, we recently explored the utility of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strategy called T1 relaxation in the rotating frame (T1?), which is highly sensitive to brain pH. We tested patients with BD in the euthymic state and found prominent T1? differences compared to matched controls. More recently, we also imaged participants with BD in depressed and manic states. These studies suggest that the brain area with the most prominent T1? changes in bipolar disorder is the cerebellum, a structure has been previously suggested to contribute to BD but has received relatively little attention compared to forebrain structures. Neuroanatomical models of BD have largely overlooked the cerebellum despite compelling evidence that the cerebellum is strongly connected to brain regions involved in the emotional control network that has been put forth as a model of the disorder. We hypothesize that cerebellar activity plays a critical role in regulating mood in BD, which will be tested in this proposal using a cross-sectional design and recruiting BD subjects across the mood spectrum as well as matched controls. Participants will undergo psychiatric symptom assessment and brain imaging. Psychiatric symptom assessments will include, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Brain imaging will include quantitative whole-brain T1? mapping, 31P- and 1H- MRS of the cerebellar vermis, as well as diffusion imaging (DWI) and resting state fMRI. Medications will be assessed and used as covariates in analyses. This data will be used to assess the following aims: Aim 1) Does cerebellar activity play a significant role in mood regulation in BD? We hypothesize that the cerebellum plays a significant role in maintaining a euthymic mood state (i.e., plays a compensatory role). We reason that if cerebellar activity normalizes mood, then its activity should be greatest when BD participants are euthymic and decrease with increasing mood symptom severity. Alternatively, if cerebellar activity drives abnormal moods, then it is likely to be greatest in patients who are manic or depressed. Aim 2) Does connectivity of the cerebellar vermis with the emotional control network differ with mood symptoms in BD? We hypothesize that functional connectivity between the vermis and nodes of the emotional control network will vary with mood state with increased connectivity in the euthymic state and decreased connectivity during exaggerated mood states (depression/mania). We also expect that BD participants in the euthymic state will exhibit increased connectivity relative to healthy controls. These results would provide further evidence that the cerebellum is playing a compensatory role to maintain mood. In addition, this would support a refined model of the neural circuits underlying the pathophysiology of BD."
"9439910","PROJECT SUMMARY The escalating health and economic burden of non-communicable disease (NCD) represents a global health challenge that disproportionally affects women and children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Adverse environmental conditions in early life such as impaired fetal growth or birth to a preeclamptic (PreE) mother increase susceptibility to NCD across the lifespan. In Bolivia, maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates are the third highest in the Western Hemisphere due, in part, to the fact that two-thirds of its population resides at high altitude (? 2500 m) where the incidence of PreE and fetal growth restriction is three- fold greater relative to low altitude. Bolivia also suffers from an increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with congenital cardiac defects, neonatal pulmonary hypertension, adult-onset pulmonary vascular disease, right heart failure and polycythemia being more common at high than at low altitude. Our objective is to lay the foundation for sustainable research programs designed to identify mechanistic links between antenatal exposures that are of particular relevance at high-altitudes in Bolivia (e.g., PreE, intrauterine hypoxia) and the development NCDs. Towards this goal, we will first conduct a series of targeted workshops in La Paz, the administrative capital and home to the major public medical university in Bolivia, for engaging leading Bolivian practitioners, medical researchers and health-policy makers to update and standardize diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies for hypertensive pregnancy complications because accurate diagnosis of these conditions is a critical starting point for prospective studies of perinatal exposures and NCD risk, and use of recently updated guidelines are not yet standard practice in Bolivia. Concurrently, we will leverage resources provided by the Global Pregnancy Collaboration (CoLab) to establish a centralized, online perinatal database (The COLLECT Global Collaboration Database) and an accompanying biorepository in La Paz, Bolivia that will be tailored for the collection of prospective data using mobile-health technologies. Based on extensive evidence that epigenomic mechanisms play a pivotal role for the effect of environmental exposures in early life to increase NCD risk, and our preliminary data suggesting that PreE modifies epigenetic and gene expression patterns of genes important for cardiopulmonary vascular development, pulmonary hypertension and CVD, we will then use the perinatal database and biorepository to conduct an exploratory study to determine the role of epigenetic processes for the link between PreE and development of pulmonary vascular dysfunction during infancy. Together, our proposed studies will a) enable improvements in clinical practice and health policy likely to reduce the frequency of cardiopulmonary diseases later in life for both mother and child in Bolivia, b) build research capacity for enabling LMIC investigators to conduct further studies on the mechanisms linking early- life exposures and NCDs, and, in the long-term, c) reduce NCD-related morbidity and mortality."
"9385259","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry is a community organized project that aims to facilitate the discovery, development, application, harmonization, interoperability and sharing of ontologies. OBO ontologies are widely used as a standard for knowledge representation in a broad range of domains relevant to the NIH basic, translational, and clinical research mission. They cover for example gene functions (Gene Ontology, GO), diseases and phenotypes (Disease Ontology, DO; Human Phenotype Ontology, HP; Uberon Anatomy Ontology), assay types (Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, OBI), and relationships connecting these entities, both within and across ontologies (Relationship Ontology, RO). For over a decade, OBO has provided a variety of widely used services to the community, including 1) the OBO registry, which collects standardized metadata for each member ontology such as domain, scope, license, point of contact, etc., thus enhancing findability of each ontology, 2) configurable Persistent URLs (PURLs), which provide an unchanging address for ontologies and ontology classes, enhancing accessibility and reuse, 3) optional content hosting for OBO ontologies that want to take advantage of centrally managed versioning, 4) standardized software tools that make it easy to follow best practices for ontology development, 5) OBO principles, guidelines and best practices, designed to enhance quality and interoperability, and 6) an outreach and coordination effort to mediate between different member ontologies with the goal to coordinate and reduce overlap, through a central email list and regular teleconferences. The present proposal will provide time-limited, catalytic support to increase robustness of existing services by upgrading critical infrastructure on which they are based, by defining and applying standards for metadata and PURL management, and by applying best practices from software engineering to increase maintainability of the codebase. Second, we will introduce new capabilities into our service infrastructure to add automated quality controls to ontologies (individually and in groups), enhance the integration between our services and standardized tools, and add monitoring and metrics. Third, we will perform outreach and training efforts to increase the ability of the community to participate in the OBO project. In accomplishing these aims we will continue to keep our operating costs extremely low, and to freely share the tools and resources we build."
"9548880","Targeting cerebrovascular endothelial cells as a therapeutic approach for amyloid pathogenesis Project Summary The accumulation of amyloid-? (A?) in the brain blood vessels can result in the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is a pathological feature present concomitantly with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) at a high frequency, highlighting a potentially important role for vascular A? in dementias such as AD. While the basis by which A? mediates deleterious effect on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is likely multifactorial, numerous studies indicate a role for A? mediated increases in endothelial cell permeability. The exact causes for BBB dysfunction in CAA are not well known, however impaired clearance of A? from the brain across the BBB as well as a reduction in the efficacy of the perivascular drainage of A? have been proposed to enhance accumulation of cerebrovascular and parenchymal amyloid deposits in the elderly. Despite our understanding of the pathways responsible for BBB dysfunction and clearance of A?, the availability of drugs to treat A? pathogenesis related disorders, CAA and AD, remains lacking. The long-term goal of this project is to develop therapeutics that target the BBB to restore its function and maximize clearance of A? from the brain, which is important to prevent or delay onset of CAA and AD. The overall goal of this project is to fully characterize an experimental endothelial BBB model as an effective high-throughput screening (HTS) format to identify therapeutics for vascular A? pathogenesis disorders (AD, CAA and vascular dementia). The central hypothesis is that high-throughput screening (HTS) utilizing a highly novel cerebrovascular endothelial BBB model can be used to identify small molecules which beneficially regulate A? clearance and reduce A? mediated increases in BBB permeability. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Utilization of a cell line-based BBB model to screen for modulators of A? mediated disturbances of endothelial cell function. This aim will be accomplished by investigating the following sub-aims: 1A) screen for compounds, in the presence of A?42 oligomers, for their effect on the gross permeability of cerebrovascular endothelial cells using Lucifer Yellow (LY) as a gross permeability marker. Compounds which reduce A?-mediated permeability will be advanced to Sub-Aim 1B; 1B) identify stimulators of A? clearance across the BBB model using the gold standard measure of iodinated A? as the endpoint for A? clearance. Hit compounds will be further examined in Aim 2. 2) Validation and mechanistic investigation of hit compounds from Aim1 for their ability to modulate expression of tight junction and A? clearance proteins (transport and degradation). This aim will be accomplished by testing the following sub-aims: 2A) conduct secondary confirmation and establish profiles for hits identified in Aim 1, 2B) comparison of hits kinetics for amelioration of A?42 oligomers induced permeability and reduced A? clearance in primary cerebrovascular endothelial cells with those of Sub-Aim 2A, 2C) mechanistic investigation for improved BBB tightness, integrity and A? clearance by hit compounds selected from 2B. 3) Test ability of the top 2 hits from Aim 2 to in vivo modulate vascular and parenchymal A? accumulation, and BBB integrity in a mouse model of CAA. Methods and technique to be used to accomplish the above aims include in vitro cell culture, high-throughput screening, transport, permeability and clearance studies, A? kinetics, microvessels isolation from brains of wild type mice, and in vivo studies in CAA model. The data produced will provide candidate therapeutic molecules to test in future clinical studies."
"9309749","ABSTRACT  Approximately 18 million people (1 in every 12 adults) in the USA abuse or are dependent on alcohol. The etiology of alcohol use disorders is complex; heritable susceptibility factors interact with environmental factors to produce and maintain the disease state. One goal of current neuroscience research is, therefore, to identify the neuroadaptations mediating the propensity to consume high amounts of alcohol, of either innate or environmental origin. In particular, dysfunctions of prefronto-striatal projections have been proposed to play a critical role in alcohol addiction.  This project concerns pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a highly conserved 38 amino acid neuropeptide, and its receptor PAC1R. Studies in flies, rodents and humans have started to reveal a crucial role for the PACAP/PAC1R system in motivated behaviors and in the actions of drugs of abuse. The lack of studies exploring its role in alcohol addiction constitutes a barrier to the advancement of the field. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that neuroadaptions in the PACAP/PAC1R system of the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc Core) mediate the susceptibility to drink excessively.  Our long-term goal is to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic propensity to drink excessively and the transition to alcohol dependence. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that hyperactivation of the PACAP/PAC1 system in the medial prefrontal cortex -NAcc Core pathway mediates excessive drinking and the long-lasting neuroplastic changes observed in alcohol dependence. We will test our hypotheses using a multidisciplinary approach which includes the use of chemogenetic, pharmacological, neurochemical, and molecular techniques.  The results of the proposed experiments will provide key insights into the neuroadaptive changes responsible for excessive drinking."
"9564343","Targeting the interplay between KLF4 and PRMT5 in carcinogenesis The goal of this project is to determine the impact of interplay between KLF4 and PRMT5 in breast carcinogenesis and anti-breast cancer therapy. Krppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a critical regulator of cell fate for cell division, apoptosis, and DNA damage, and plays an ambivalent role in tumorigenesis. Over 70% of human primary mammary cancers exhibit cellular accumulation of KLF4, and the impact of KLF4 on breast cancer formation has been recently indicated by the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). The most recent studies by us and others have demonstrated an oncogenic role for KLF4 in breast carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, how KLF4 is regulated and how its deregulation contributes to breast carcinogenesis remains unknown. Results from our recent purification of the KLF4 protein complex revealed that two critical enzymes, VHL and PRMT5, tightly interact with and regulate KLF4. While the ubiquitin E3 ligase VHL/VBC catalyzes KLF4 for ubiquitylation followed by degradation, we observed that methylation of KLF4 protein by PRMT5 (an arginine-based methyltransferase) results in the stabilization of KLF4 and promotion of KLF4-mediated transcription. Unexpected elevation of KLF4 levels due to enhanced KLF4 methylation counteracts KLF4 ubiquitylation, which in turn triggers tumor initiation and promotes tumor invasion. We further observed that deregulation of KLF4 methylation by aberrant PRMT5 expression impairs DNA damage checkpoint function, which could induce malignant transformation due to loss of genomic integrity. Thus, we ask if PRMT5 is a critical factor that determines the oncogenic role for KLF4 in breast carcinogenesis, and if the PRMT5-KLF4 cascade could be a novel target for breast cancer therapy. This proposal aims to determine the pathophysiological role of KLF4 methylation by PRMT5 in mammary tumorigenesis, and to further identify the clinical relevance of the KLF4-PRMT5 axis in breast cancer therapy. In this project, we plan to test the hypothesis that deregulation of KLF4 by PRMT5 promotes tumorigenesis and tumor invasion by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) to determine how methylation of KLF4 by PRMT5 regulates KLF4 protein stability and function; (2) to determine how the dysregulation of KLF4 by PRMT5 affects the self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells and promotes tumorigenesis; and (3) to determine the impact of deregulation of KLF4 by PRMT5 in breast tumor progression/invasion and validate the therapeutic intervention of our newly developed KLF4 methylation inhibitor in breast cancer treatment using murine models."
"9422310","PROJECT SUMMARY Molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapies hold the promise of providing new, more effective treatment options for solid tumor patients. Significant strides have been made in identifying subsets of patients with defined genetic alterations that benefit greatly from these therapies. However, the genetic and molecular heterogeneity of solid tumors suggest that the application of novel molecular therapies will not be a ?one size fit all?. The pharmacodynamics effects of these treatments as well as the underlying biology of the tumor are likely to contribute to the effectiveness of current treatments, and careful evaluation of these parameters are likely to give rise to novel biomarkers. The first step in this process is the integration of high quality, innovative correlative studies into our clinical trials so we can learn from these valuable patient samples. This application outlines a program, the Solid Tumor Translational Science Shared Resource (STTS-SR), that I established within the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center to drive the development of novel biomarker assays and incorporate them into Phase I/II clinical trials. Thus providing an opportunity to better understand the biology of the tumors we are treating and insight into which pathways to explore next. At the same time, I utilize my expertise in drug development and the ever-evolving molecular techniques to help basic and translational scientists explore pre-clinical hypotheses and move their findings from the laboratory to the clinic in order to make a meaningful contribution to the care of our cancer patients. My training in cancer biology and unique background working in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industry has provided me with the experience and expertise to successfully direct this laboratory and develop the following four objectives: 1) to work closely with clinical and translational investigators in the design and management of correlative studies in Phase I/II clinical trials, 2) to coordinate specimen acquisition and drive novel biomarker assay development 3) to integrate the results of the molecular assays with the clinical data and 4) foster the translation of findings from basic biology research programs to the clinic."
"9218491","Project Summary/Abstract One of the main reasons to study the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is that it has, and will continue to serve as a molecular paradigm for the investigation of mechanosensory transduction. With a crystal structure of what appears to be a ?nearly-closed? state of M. tuberculosis MscL, the channel has advanced the field considerably by allowing researchers to overlay genetic and molecular analyses, coupled with electrophysiology, onto a structural model. Thus, MscL from E. coli (Ec-MscL), which was the first defini- tive mechanosensitive channel identified, continues to serve as a tractable model for determining principles for how a protein senses and responds to membrane tension. However, another reason to study MscL is that the channel serves a vital function in maintaining osmotic homeostasis of microbes. It normally serves as a biolog- ical emergency release valve; upon osmotic downshock it opens a huge 30 pore that allows for the rapid re- lease of many accumulated cytoplasmic components, including potassium and glutamate, thus preventing cell lysis. When the channel gates inappropriately it can lead to the death of the microbial cell; it thus is a viable pharmacological target for potential antibiotics. Historically, one of the limitations in the study of MscL function and pharmacology has been the total lack of small molecular probes that bind and modulate the channel. From a High Throughput Screening (HTS) facility on campus, we have identified 18 novel chemical compounds that inhibit the growth of E. coli in a MscL-dependent manner; surprisingly, an additional hit was streptomycin, which appears to directly bind to and increase the probability of opening the MscL channel. We have used this system to develop and refine assays for determining compound efficacy. In 96 well plates we can assay cell growth to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of compounds in the presence or absence of expressed Ec-MscL, MscL orthologues, or the unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS as a nega- tive control. In addition, we have potassium and glutamate flux assays to measure the results of MscL gating in vivo, the ability to determine channel function by electrophysiology, and have developed assays to determine the binding sites of compounds. We will use this array of assays to determine if and how the novel compounds identified in the HTS bind and modulate MscL activity. These studies will yield insight into mechanosensitive channel gating mechanisms; in addition, co-crystallization of MscL with one or more of these compounds may yield an open state structure for MscL, and the findings could eventually lead to a new generation of antibiotics."
"9485814","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on transcription initiation and elongation by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Transcription initiation and elongation involve a series of steps: (i) RNAP binds to promoter DNA, yielding an RNAP-promoter closed complex; (ii) RNAP unwinds promoter DNA, yielding an RNAP-promoter open complex; (iii) RNAP synthesizes the first ~11 nucleotides of RNA as an RNAP-promoter initial transcribing complex, using a scrunching mechanism, in which RNAP remains stationary on promoter DNA and pulls in adjacent DNA in each nucleotide-addition cycle; and (iv) RNAP breaks its interactions with promoter DNA and synthesizes the remaining nucleotides of RNA as an RNAP-DNA elongation complex, using a stepping mechanism, in which RNAP moves forward on DNA in each nucleotide-addition cycle. Each of these steps is a potential target for transcriptional regulators Understanding transcription initiation, transcription elongation, and transcriptional regulation wil require defining the structural transitions in protein and DNA at each step, the kinetics of structural transitions, and the mechanisms by which regulators affect structural transitions. In the current period, we identified a new crystal form that enables high-resolution structural studies of the RNAP-promoter open complex (RPo) and the RNAP-promoter initial transcribing complex (RPitc), we determined the first high-resolution structure of RPo, and we delineated a DNA sequence element recognized by RNAP (the core recognition element, CRE). In other work in the current period, we developed a single-molecule-fluorescence assay that enables the monitoring of RNAP clamp conformation in solution, and we defined RNAP clamp conformation at each step in transcription initiation. The proposed work will build on the findings of the curret period. The proposed work will use x-ray crystallography, single-molecule biophysics, biochemistry, and genetics to address five specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Determination of the structural basis of de novo transcription initiation Specific Aim 2: Determination of the structura basis of initial transcription Specific Aim 3: Analysis of RNAP-CRE interactions in transcription initiation Specific Aim 4: Analysis of RNAP-CRE interactions in transcription elongation Specific Aim 5: Analysis of RNAP clamp conformation in transcription elongation The results will contribute to understanding bacterial transcription and transcriptional regulation, and will contribute to design and synthesis of small-molecule inhibitors of bacterial transcription, for use in antibacterial therapy. Since bacterial RNAP shows sequence, structural, and mechanistic similarities to eukaryotic RNAP, the results also will contribute to understanding eukaryotic transcription and transcriptional regulation."
"9405967","ABSTRACT  Project 4 Reading and math problems represent an important public health issue for children in that they are associated with various negative outcomes including school failure, limited occupational success, and juvenile delinquency (Geary et al., 2012; Reynolds et al., 2002). Of US fourth-grade students, one-fourth fail to reach even partial mastery of grade-level knowledge in reading, and one-fifth fail to reach partial mastery of grade-level knowledge in math (NCES, 2015), highlighting the prevalence of reading and math difficulties in childhood. Given we know that children who struggle in reading often also struggle in math, it is important to identify influences on the development of both reading and math. The overall goal of the proposed research is to uncover salient factors, including genetic and environmental influences, which contribute to the co- development of reading and math performance, at a critical developmental point (elementary school). We will identify the first nationally-representative US twin sample through the proposed National Project on Achievement in Twins (NatPAT). The NatPAT sample will comprise 7,668 pairs of twins located across the US, and will be uniquely situated to address the overall goal of the proposed research through four specific aims (SA). First, we will utilize a large national database of reading and math performance from schools across the country to ascertain the NatPAT twin sample. Using a cohort-sequential design starting in kindergarten, we will examine reading and math performance across elementary school in order to model genetic and environmental influences on reading and math (co-)development (Specific Aim 1). Second, we will model the genetic and environmental influences on the co-occurrence of reading and math difficulties, while also testing for sex differences (Specific Aim 2). Third, we will capitalize on publically available data to characterize the environmental contexts related to the (co-)development of reading and math performance (Specific Aim 3). Finally, we will capture important attitudinal individual differences dimensions and examine how they are associated with the (co-)development of reading and math performance (Specific Aim 4)."

"9385642","This renewal application seeks support for the infrastructure of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study, which was established in Hawaii and southern California in 1993-1996 to study risk factors for cancer and other chronic diseases. The study was designed to take advantage of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the two geographic areas, as well as the expertise of the investigators in nutrition, ethnic/racial studies, and genetics. It is the most ethnically diverse cancer cohort in existence. It achieves high cost-efficiency by supplementing active follow-up information with computerized linkages to SEER, vital statistics, hospital-discharge diagnoses, medical claim data, electronic medical records and geospatial information. At baseline, the cohort included information on 215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a prospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants. Leadership of the MEC entails a highly interactive, team approach; and the investigators have amply demonstrated their willingness to share data/samples, and to participate actively in consortia. This application describes our aims over the next 5 years for maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MEC, as well as plans for methodological research. Research accomplishments include significant contributions to understanding both genetic and environmental risk factors for cancer. Over 280 papers describing our findings have been published during the current grant cycle. In addition, over the last 20 years, 98 research grants have been built around the MEC, and more than 75 students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained on the study. This grant renewal will make possible the continuation of a well-integrated program of research aimed at evaluating environmental and genetic risk factors for cancer and other common chronic diseases, taking advantage of new approaches, such as genomics, microbiomics, adductomics and metabolomics. The MEC will allow the testing of innovative research hypotheses aimed at ensuring that progress in prevention applies to major US ethnic/racial minorities."
"9444130","Project Summary: Project 1, Perturbations and Behavior  Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The individual parts of the project cohere conceptually, in part, because they all involve rodents trained to perform a type of decision-making task that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. Neural correlates of working memory and decision-making are distributed across a very wide range of cortical and subcortical regions, but a complete listing of which of these regions actually cause these processes?and most importantly, what the nature of their contribution might be?remains out of reach. A signi??cant obstacle has been that these processes can evolve rapidly (for example, going from loading an item into working memory, to holding it in memory, to retrieving it) and it is only recently that inactivation tools, such as inhibitory optogenetic molecules, could be turned on and o?? fast enough to distinguish between di??erent phases. This project will use optogenetic inactivation in combination with this set of closely related working memory and decision-making tasks for the head-??xed rodent. The tasks are amenable to highly quantitative behavioral analysis. These features will allow a systematic and comprehensive quantitative probe of the causal contribution to working memory and decision-making of a very large set of regions across the dorsal cortex, deeper cortices, and targeted subcortical regions, including the cerebellum, the ventral tegmental area, the hippocampus, and the striatum. Other experiments will study the causal contributions of di??erent genetically de??ned cell types, in targeted brain regions. Taken together, these experiments are expected to provide detailed information about how the interaction of particular neurons in the brain produces working memory and decisions, increasing knowledge about the brain basis of cognition.

These tests will be used to characterize the response of myeloid neoplasms obtained from patients and preclinical models to targeted therapies being tested in each of the projects. The Core is led by Dr. Jon C. Aster, a senior leukemia investigator and practicing hematopathologist. Tests will be carried out in the Core will include assays that gauge NPM1 and DNMT3A mutational status (Project 1), SYK activation (Project 2), mutational status of genes encoding spliceasome components and SF3B1 inhibition (Project 3), and the expression of immune checkpoint proteins (Project 4). The Core will also perform serial NextGen Sequencing to determine the effect of targeted therapy on clonal dynamics, and develop new tests that assess the sensitivity of tumor cells to apoptosis (BH3 profiling/mitochondrial priming), or that predict and gauge the response of neoplastic cells to SYK inhibitors, Menin/MLL inhibitors, and other targeted therapeutics. The specific aims of the Core are: 1) To use a clinically validated amplicon-based NextGen sequencing test to identify mutations, define clonal heterogeneity, and follow the clonal evolution of myeloid neoplasms during therapy 2) To develop, validate, and implement tests for phospho-SYK, immune checkpoint proteins, lineage- specific host immune cell markers, and other protein biomarkers 3) To develop, validate, and implement RNA profiling-based tests that identify signatures of effective targeting of leukemogenic signaling pathways with novel therapeutic agents, including spliceasome inhibitors, and Menin/MLL inhibitors 4) To develop, validate, and implement a BH3 profiling/mitochondrial priming assay to predict the response of myeloid neoplasms to targeted therapeutics"
"9352319","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly fatal disease with an overall 5-year survival of <5%. Progress in PDAC lags behind other cancers and there is a tremendous need to better understand the etiology of PDAC in order to develop early diagnostic methods and better treatments. Pancreatic carcinogenesis is driven by inflammation. Established risk factors for pancreatic cancer include chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, obesity, and smoking, each associated with an inflammatory mechanism. However, these risk factors do not fully explain the majority of pancreatic cancer cases. E merging evidence suggests that variation in our `other genome'-the collective genome of the microorganisms inhabiting our body, known as the microbiome-may have an even greater role than the human genome variations in the  Recent discoveries suggest that bacteria are likely to influence this process by activating immune receptors and perpetuating cancer-associated inflammation. Further investigations are needed to fully understand the interaction between inflammation and the microbiota in the development of this deadly disease. We propose to characterize the microbiota in pancreatic tissue from patients with chronic pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreaticogenic (T3cDM) diabetes mellitus, and PDAC using next-generation sequencing protocols. We will also characterize microbiota present in the pancreatic juice, saliva, and stools of the same subjects aiming to find correlative microbial signatures across multiple body sites. The Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) is a world leader in the study of the microbiome with innovative approaches and thus is ideally suited to coordinate this study. In addition, the Elkins Pancreas Center (EPC) at BCM is eminently suited to be a collaborative member of a national pancreatic research consortium. The EPC will provide access to a large population of patients with pancreatitis, T3cDM, and PDAC, and considerable experience in collaboration for the conduct of clinical trials, sophisticated prospective data collection, and access to a mature tissue repositor for studies proposed by the Consortium. This project is timely and highly relevant to the goals of the NIH Roadmap and the NIH Human Microbiome Project. This novel approach will allow us to create a pathogenic model for pancreatic cancer that will offer innovative strategies for prevention, biomarkers for early detection, and targets for intervention. pathogenesis of cancer."
"9450000","INVESTIGATOR DEVELOPMENT CORE Summary/ Abstract The Center for Collaborative Research in Minority Health and Health Disparities (CCRMHD) at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus proposes an Investigator Development Core (IDC) for its budgetary cycle 2017-2022. The CCRMHD will coordinate a pilot-project program (PPP) to nurture the growth of promising junior faculty within the UPR-MSC by soliciting, reviewing, and awarding funds to innovative proposals that will lead to competitive independent funding. The overall goals of the IDC are three-fold: 1) to mentor early career investigators as they transition to independent funding; 2) to fund innovative basic, behavioral and/or clinical pilot projects focusing on health disparities and/or minority health; 3) to match RCMI faculty with outside collaborators/mentors in order to strengthen collaborative networks. At the end of the proposed cycle, it is expected that 6-8 Early Stage Investigators (ESI), working on basic biomedical, behavioral and/or health services/clinical research, will have been funded, mentored, and well on their way to independent funding relevant to minority health and health disparities. We plan to accomplish this goal through the following Specific Aims: Grantees will receive a two-year grant of $35-50,000 per year in order to sustain studies for a sufficient period of time to compete successfully for outside funding. Mentoring activities will include informal meetings, rehearsal of scientific presentations, discussion of topics relevant to successful transition to running their own labs (using the best-seller book: At the Helm: Leading your Laboratory); and mock study-sections. Tracking and evaluation mechanisms will be established to measure scientific progress and ensure that the goals of the program are met, including increasing the number of publications, generating preliminary data, and increasing grant applications and awards (including R-type and K awards). Outcome metrics will be used to refine or refocus the solicitation, review, selection, and funding of applications made to the PPP. Staff from the Administrative Core will support and monitor full compliance with local and federal regulatory requirements. The IDC will be directed by Dr. Gregory J. Quirk, a senior neuroscientist at UPR-RCM, who currently serves as chair of a standing study-section at NIH-Center for Scientific Review and has been awarded an R35 grant at NIMH. Dr. Quirk, a basic biomedical researcher, will be assisted by an advisory committee that will include representation of the behavioral and health services/clinical areas. The IDC will coordinate closely with the Pilot Project Program of the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium (PRCTRC), to share mentoring activities and resources and avoid support overlap."
"9563347","TR&D 4: Optical Imaging & Monitoring  P.I: Arjun G. Yodh, PhD  ABSTRACT   Diffuse optics has proven to be clinically relevant, and as a result, many scientists, engineers and clinicians  are now working together in this field of biomedicine. Technological innovation with diffuse optics continues  along two branches: imaging and monitoring. Clinical innovation with diffuse optics is focused on many  problems, notably cancer diagnosis and monitoring and brain injury management. Biomarkers are the key  reason for the sustained interest of this broad community. In particular, hemodynamic, perfusion and metabolic  contrasts, among others, are available to the optical method and have demonstrated value for detection,  diagnosis and monitoring of tumors, and for characterization and monitoring of diseased and injured states of  brain and muscle tissue. The technology is also attractive because it offers the possibility for non-invasive,  rapid, portable and continuous measurements at the bedside. TRD4 will focus on both branches of technology  development, imaging and monitoring, and it will also focus on two important classes of clinical problem, breast  cancer and brain injury. A recurring theme is the combination of two data-types: blood flow & oxy-/deoxy-  hemoglobin concentration. In combination, these data provide untapped access to tissue metabolism and  autoregulation.   One research direction is oriented towards neurovascular monitoring. TRD4 will develop new dual-data-  type instrumentation and algorithms based on blood flow and blood oxygenation contrast that directly address  issues that have plagued all optical measurements of brain: corrupting signals from extra-cerebral tissues, and  the so-called ?hair? problem. Solution of these problems leads naturally to the development of a more  comprehensive optical monitor that interrogates cortical flow and oxygenation comprehensively (and non-  invasively) over the whole head. Lastly, minimally-invasive probes for spinal cord monitoring will be developed  to address a new clinical application in the surgical suite wherein continuous, real-time measurements at the  surgical bedside are crucial: spinal cord ischemia.   The second research direction is oriented towards breast cancer imaging. TRD4 will complete and utilize a  multi-modal DOT-MRI clinical breast imager within a standard-of-care hospital MRI scanner at the Hospital of  the University of Pennsylvania (i.e., 1.5 T with Sentinelle breast biopsy coils). Soft spatial priors from MRI  enable tumor optical properties to be derived with high fidelity, and the combination of optical and MRI  biomarkers will be explored for improved cancer characterization via computer aided diagnosis (CAD). Finally,  multi-modal experiments will combine DOT hemoglobin concentration data with Ktrans data (i.e., flow data) from  dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and KWIC (TRD 3) to enable construction of oxygen metabolism  images of breast."
"9390700","Abstract In a lifestyle modification program, contact with an interventionist (e.g., weight loss coach) creates a sense of supportive accountability that can facilitate behavior change and weight loss. Sustaining a strong sense of supportive accountability after face-to-face intervention contact ends has the potential to improve outcomes during the notoriously difficult weight loss maintenance period. One innovative way of facilitating supportive accountability is providing participants with digital tools that objectively measure weight and PA and track food intake in real-time, making the data from those tools automatically and continuously available to coaches, and designing the timing and content of intervention contacts such that they are responsive to the shared data. Although tools that allow for data sharing from sensors and Internet-based applications are readily available, the ways in which they are integrated into intervention contacts in a lifestyle modification program are not yet optimized, and research has not systematically evaluated the effect of data sharing on behavior. Overweight and obese participants (n = 90) will be recruited from the community for a small RCT in order to test the feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and mechanisms of action of a lifestyle modification intervention enhanced with data sharing. In weeks 1-12 of the program (i.e., Phase I), all participants will attend 12 weekly, face-to- face, group-based behavioral treatment sessions to induce weight loss. Participants will be provided with a wireless body weight scale, PA sensor, and digital food record app and instructed to use them daily use for self-monitoring purposes. In Phase II (weeks 13-52), participants will be randomly assigned to the standard (LM) or enhanced version of remote lifestyle modification (LM+SHARE). Neither condition will have face-to- face intervention contact during Phase II; remote intervention contact will consist of brief phone calls and text messages provided by the participant's coach. Participants in both conditions will be prescribed continued daily use of the three self-monitoring devices. In the standard LM condition, no digital data from these devices will be directly shared with coaches; intervention encounters will be informed only by the infrequent, delayed self- report of participants (which is the current standard of long-term obesity care), and timing of text messages will be fixed. In LM+SHARE, the digital tools will automatically and continuously transmit body weight, PA, and food record data to the coach. In LM+SHARE, supportive accountability will be enhanced in three ways: 1) participants will receive automated alerts after coaches view their data, 2) timing of personalized text messages from coaches will be responsive to clinically notable change in weight, PA, calorie intake, or use of scale, PA sensor, or food record tool, and 3) content of the text messages and phone calls will be informed by the digital data the coach has viewed, as well as the expectation that the coach will continue viewing data in order to provide ongoing support. Assessments will be completed at 0, 12, 26, 40, and 52 weeks."
"9528959","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome.

The new algorithms we develop and the high confidence lists of SVs obtained will be rapidly made available as a public resource."
"9311431","PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials."

"9276699","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cells form specific cell shapes and divide into two during cytokinesis are fundamental questions in cell biology. Mechanical forces, structural elements such as the membranes, cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment, and signaling networks all contribute to specify the shape of the cell. Here, we study mechanical-based regulatory mechanisms for cytokinesis and cell polarization in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These are simple rod-shaped eukaryotic cells that grow at cell tips and divide medially using a contractile ring and septum. Preliminary results suggest that mechanical forces from the actomyosin contractile ring contribute to shaping the ring and septum cell wall, ensuring that cytokinesis completes efficiently. Mechanical mechanisms also shape the rounded cell ends and contribute to cell polarity. Through quantitative cell biology and molecular genetics, we will elucidate these mechanoregulatory mechanisms and characterize key regulatory components in these pathways. These studies have broad impact on understanding mechanical-based regulation and cell shape control in mammalian cells and are relevant to human diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Our specific aims are 1) to determine to role of the contractile ring in coordinating formation of the septum; 2) to determine how the dynamics and distribution of actin and other ring components are regulated in the contractile ring; 3) to determine how mechanical-based mechanisms regulate cell shape and polarity pathways at the ends of the cell."

"9446285","Summary The cilium is a widely distributed cell surface organelle that functions as a signaling hub for the vertebrate cell. Ciliary defects leads to a wide range of human diseases collectively referred to as ciliopathies. Multiple ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis, show renal fibrosis. However, the role of cilia in renal fibrosis has not been studied extensively. In this project, we use Arl13b, a gene essential for cilia biogenesis, as an entry point to dissect the role of cilia in renal fibrosis. We generated conditional Arl13b knockout mice. Our results show that deletion of Arl13b in renal epithelial cells leads to renal fibrosis and cysts. Moreover, multiple signaling pathways, including the Wnt, HH and Hippo pathway, are mis-regulated in the mutant kidney. This project focuses on dissecting tissue specific functions of cilia and communications between different cell types in renal fibrosis through both candidate and unbiased approaches. Aim 1 is focused on signaling in renal epithelial cells regulated by ciliary defects and the relationship between different pathways. Aim 2 studies targets in interstitial cells that are affected by ciliary defects and the functional significance of interstitial cilia. Through this study, we will elucidate how ciliary defects in epithelial cells triggers a signaling cascade that eventually lead to renal fibrosis and whether and how cilia in interstitial cells modify this response. These results not only will provide insight to the mechanism of renal fibrosis in ciliopathies, but will also be informative to fibrosis in general."
"9332363","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inferior colliculus (IC) is the major subcortical integrator of the auditory system. Its central nucleus (the ICC) receives ascending input from almost all lower auditory brainstem regions. These inputs are organized within the ICC's microcircuit by diverse cell types that are largely undefine, neurotransmitter content, and intrinsic properties, these parameters do not correlate in such a way to define functional subtypes of neurons. This presents a major barrier to our understanding of sound encoding in the brain as well as auditory pathologies such as chronic tinnitus, which is associated with hyperactivity in the IC driven by a subset of cells that undergo marked changes in biophysical properties. Therefore, I will utilize genetic markers as a novel approach to assessing neuronal subtypes and their functional roles in the ICC. I have identified three transgenic mouse lines that I believe to label subtypes of inhibitory and excitatory cells in the IC and made paired recordings to begin functional characterization of the local circuit for the first time. I hypothesize that geetic markers will define discrete sets of neuronal subtypes that mediate the intrinsic computational capacity of the IC. Specifically, I predict that somatostatin+ cells, based on evidence for local excitation, are excitatory interneurons that mediate intralaminar excitation to widen the dynamic range of the microcircuit. Parvalbumin+ cells, based on commissural fiber labeling, likely mediate inhibitory intercollicular interactions. Finally, collagen beta(1-O)galactosyltransferase 2 cells, distinctly large and excitatory, likely integrate information from the microcircuit to projet to the auditory thalamus.  The purpose of this proposal is to test: (1) whether cellular subtypes can be defined based on genetic markers and (2) how cell types interconnect to inform a local circuit diagram for the ICC. In Aim 1 I will take advantage of Cre transgenic mouse lines to target specific neuronal populations, enabling me to selectively visualize and manipulate genetically defined cell populations. I will determine whether the reporter lines mentioned above identify functionally discrete cell types via assay of intrinsic biophysical properties with in vitro electrophysiology, morphology, and neurotransmitter content. This approach will allow me to define cellular subtypes in the IC in a way that has not yet been possible. In Aim 2 I will test th functional connectivity of local circuitry with optogenetic stimulation of molecularly defined cell types, paired recordings within laminae, and intracranial injections of Cre-dependent virus that drives fluorophore expression to visualize efferent fiber tracts. The proposed research answers fundamental questions about the internal structure of the IC and utilizes novel resources to unravel a brain circuit with cellular resolution. This research will provide cellular mechanisms underlying the essential role of local circuitry in neural processing of sound in the IC. This in trn will provide insight into how dysfunctions within this circuit lead to common disorders of the auditory system."

"9407459","Current diabetes therapies cannot prevent life threatening hypoglycemic events, and chronic complications for hundreds of thousands of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients (9-11). These critical-need patients represent a substantial investment opportunity, by their urgent need for a new solution beyond life- sustaining exogenous insulin replacement, namely one that could provide long-term and precise glucose control. Such a robust and long-acting cure is presently available; islet and pancreas transplantation demonstrates the proof-of-concept (POC) to replace beta-cell (insulin-producing cell) function and eliminate dependency on insulin injections (12-13). However, their wide-spread use is severely curtailed by limited organ supply and the requirement for chronic immunosuppression (14-15). In contrast, ViaCyte?s GMP human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line provides an unlimited supply of stem cells and their differentiated functional beta cells as a starting material; ViaCyte?s immune protection macro-encapsulation device can potentially eliminate the need for chronic immunosuppression in critical need patients (5,7). Indeed, as a first step, PEC-ENCAP or hESC-derived pancreatic progenitor cell (Stage 4 cell) in a macro-encapsulation device, proves that such combined technology is feasible in the clinic; it is safe and well-tolerated by patients, progenitor cells can survive and differentiate to bona-fide beta-cells in a device in T1D patients (5). Yet, hESC-derived functional beta-cells in a macro-device, we hypothesize, will be a more efficacious cell therapy treatment option requiring a smaller therapeutic footprint per patient, will be less prone to off-target differentiation, and will provide a more rapid diabetes relief. Our goal is to advance the hESC-derived functional beta-cell in a macro-device concept (defined as ?VC-03?) towards commercialization. We are uniquely positioned for high probability of future commercial success, by our ability to test multiple GMP-compliant hESC-derived stages of advanced beta-cell differentiation (endocrine precursor / Stage 5; immature beta-cell / Stage 6; functional beta-cell / Stage 7) in two macro-devices (macro-encapsulation / direct delivery). We aim to provide POC information required to initiate IND-enabling studies, by determining which specific combination of Stage 5, 6 or 7 cell and macro-device type is most appropriate for the eventual commercialization of the VC-03 product for critical-need patients. The goal of Aim 1 is to provide the scale-up and cryopreservation capabilities to Stages 5-7 of differentiation, ensuring a stable cell supply for eventual IND- enabling studies / clinical trials. The goal of Aim 2 is to lay the groundwork for in vivo efficacy data required by IND-enabling studies. The quarterly feedback cycle between characteristics obtained in parallel from Aim 1 (in vitro manufacturing) and Aim 2 (graft survival, in vivo functional analysis) will provide an unbiased platform for deciding which advanced beta-cell stage / macro-device combination is most appropriate for the IND-enabling studies of VC-03.

"9418237","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The burden of prostate cancer in the U.S. is large: an estimated 14% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. There are approximately three million prostate cancer survivors in the U.S., and the burden is highest among black men, for whom incidence and mortality rates are 169.4 and 69.0 per 100,000, respectively. The introduction of prostate-specific antigen screening has resulted in detection of more cases of prostate cancer, although many of these cases are asymptomatic and may not progress to clinical significance. Active surveillance is a management option for low-risk prostate cancer patients, during which the disease is actively monitored. Active surveillance patients are an ideal population for lifestyle interventions, which may improve diet and physical activity, reduce body mass index, and improve clinical biomarkers, thus reducing risk of other chronic conditions and second primary cancers and improving patients' quality of life. Thus far, several lifestyle interventions for patients undergoing active surveillance have had positive results; however, none have targeted spouses or partners, or black men, in their design and implementation. The proposed study seeks to pilot test Watchful Living, an innovative, culturally-relevant social support lifestyle intervention during active surveillance for black prostate cancer patients and their partners. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the feasibility of recruiting and implementing a lifestyle intervention during active surveillance for prostate cancer patients and their partners, 2) To evaluate preliminary efficacy of an active surveillance lifestyle intervention in improving diet, physical activity, quality of life, and inflammation at the end of the study (Month 6), and 3) To conduct a process evaluation of the active surveillance lifestyle intervention. We will recruit 40 patient-partner dyads from MD Anderson Cancer Center and Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, who will receive dyadic telephone coaching, exercise prescriptions in a home-based physical activity program, nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian, and educational handouts. Watchful Living has the potential to ultimately prevent morbidity and mortality due to prostate cancer by significantly reducing chronic diseases and second primary cancers, and improving the quality of life of black patients and their partners. Pilot funding is critical to demonstrating the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of our intervention. With this pilot data, we will apply for an R01 to adapt, implement, and evaluate the intervention on a larger scale."
"9390157","Summary Despite the vast diversity of its populations, genetic studies in Africa have been limited. African populations, Malians in particular, have a high rate of intra-ethnic and consanguineous marriage, resulting in increased prevalence of autosomal recessive diseases. Family-based genetic studies can be limited in developed countries due to small sib ships. The average fertility rate in Mali is over 6 births per woman, offering a unique opportunity to find new disease genes or mutations that can then be studied in other populations. Neurological disorders present public health challenges globally with total disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) greater than some infectious diseases. These challenges are even greater when considering hereditary neurological diseases that cause premature death, severe disability and loss of productivity, resulting in high health care costs. Although most are currently untreatable, increasing awareness and community engagement about hereditary neurological disorders can reduce this burden. Our previous studies have established the molecular defects in a good number of families and identified variants in novel genes. Through genetic counseling and community engagement session, patients and families as well as their communities have gained knowledge regarding the cause of these diseases; lifting in part the psychosocial burden, and orienting their partner choice. However, more work is needed for a full understanding of the mechanism of these diseases. Despite the increased number of trained physicians and students in the characterization of these diseases and the basics in genetics, many other families haven?t gotten access to medical genetic services. Standard genetic testing in several other families has been inconclusive, confirming our premise that Malians have specific phenotypic variants of hereditary neurological disorders that may be due to novel mutations or to mutations in as yet undiscovered genes. The infrastructures built with the previous award have created a suitable environment to perform state-of-art research and train the next generation African scientists. To ensure sustainability, African government should be fully engaged to empower genetic training and research funding. With this support, African scientists and clinicians would be ready to meet emerging medical genetics and genomic challenges. With the commitment of some African leaders and philanthropists, there is a hope that Africans will soon fund a big part of the research in Africa."

Provide fiscal management of the CORT; 3. Branch out exciting new developments deriving from CORT findings through a robust Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) program; 4. Organize and advertise Enrichment Activities that bring CORT and Community researchers together in scientific venues to exchange ideas and new technologies.  The AC leadership will work closely not only with lab scientists, but also with the leadership and programmers of the CLEveland Area Research Platform for Advancing Translational Healthcare (CLEARPATH), a comprehensive research database with Limited Data Set contribution from all 3 major Cleveland healthcare systems. CLEARPATH will create connected data (e.g., Biospecimen results, EMR clinical phenotype, `Omics data) as well as a Single person record across the system, enabling research cohort discovery and validation across the aggregate dataset. This approach will allow us to preliminarily validate psoriasis cohort subsets, mix `omic pathways and drug leads identified by the Cores and CRP. In addition to its roles as an information conduit and facilitator for research, the AC also promotes the cutaneous research environment for psoriasis and its comorbid and related conditions through enrichment programs. As such, the AC is instrumental in the design and planning of research symposia, and recruiting potential P&F program recipients with innovative technologies and/or complementary research expertise to the CORT.  The cross-disciplinary approach of combining a Preclinical Modeling Core (PMC) with an Applied Meta `Omics Core (AMC) that takes advantage of artificial intelligence, data mining, network techniques and machine learning to query available interaction networks and highly annotated integrated electronic medical records (EMRi) is highly innovative. The active engagement of the AC will be instrumental for the successful achievement of the broader goal of identifying new psoriasis pathways and repurposed approved drugs."
"9359229","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) remains a therapeutic challenge with expected 5-year overall survival of no more  than 50%, despite advances in the past two decades with myeloablative therapy, differentiating therapy and  immunologic and genetically targeted therapies. Core B is the translational linchpin of our multi-disciplinary  and multi-institutional P01, Discovering and Exploiting Mechanisms of Neuroblastoma (NB) Therapy  Resistance. The goal of Core B will be enabled by the well-established New Approaches to Neuroblastoma  Therapy (NANT) consortium, and has the overall objective of capitalizing on our clinical trials expertise and  infrastructure to support the translation of new therapies with demonstrated pre-clinical activity against  relapsed and refractory (resistant) NB developed in Projects 1-5 into clinical care, in order to ultimately improve  the poor survival of children with high-risk NB. The three specific aims of this Core are: 1) to provide the  clinical expertise for translation of preclinical work from Projects 1-5 collaboration with the statistical Core and  the Project investigators; 2) to provide the established and adaptable infrastructure for rapid implementation  into early phase clinical trials; 3) provide the infrastructure for embedded correlative studies, and a unique  biorepository of highly annotated tumor tissues, bone marrow, blood, and radiologic images obtained from  resistant NB patients, with genomic and pathologic analysis. Core B will obtain safety, mechanistic, and  response data from phase 1/2 trials to support promising therapies from Projects 1-5 to be tested in larger  national and international Phase 2 and 3 trials. This highly integrated P01 will allow rapid translation from  laboratory to patients, with individualized treatment, utilizing more precise biomarkers of response. Thus,  Core B will contribute substantively to the overall success of the Program and ultimately improved high-risk NB  patient outcome."
"9409414","Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized today?s treatments for many forms of cancers. In particular, blocking antibodies to immune checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), effectively unleash immune cell destruction of cancerous cells. However, the high cost of these antibody-based immunotherapies, their intensive therapeutic regimen and availability only at specialized medical centers make current immunotherapies impractical in all but the most advantaged societies. We hypothesize that an effective vaccine which can overcome these significant shortcomings of antibody-based immunotherapies while simultaneously mimicking their potent therapeutic benefits can impact the lives of countless more patients: in particular, a vaccine that induces durable levels of host antibodies against the tumor-associated PD-L1 protein will have powerful anti-tumor effects by inhibiting the PD-L1:PD1 immunosuppressive checkpoint interaction. We, at VLP Therapeutics, have developed a proprietary, ?plug-and-play? vaccine platform called inserted alphavirus virus-like particle (i-?VLP) using the Chikungunya (CHIK) VLP. VLPs mimic the conformation of native viruses without the viral genome, thus capable of stimulating a robust host response absent safety issues. Foreign antigens can be inserted into the surface loop domains of i-?VLP. Due to its unique structure, i-?VLP can efficiently present a dense array of 240 copies of the inserted antigen on the particle surface. i-?VLP induces highly effective immune responses to the inserted antigen, and CHIK VLPs have shown acceptable safety profiles in a Phase I clinical trial. We propose to establish proof of concept of our PD-L1-targeting vaccine?s efficacy in a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)-like model given that (1) TNBCs have shown some responsiveness to PD-L1/PD-1 antibody therapies in clinical trials; and (2) there remains a high unmet need for effective therapies against this particularly aggressive form of breast cancer which has the worst five- year survival prognosis among all breast cancers and for which standard chemotherapy treatment is largely ineffective. The goal of this proposal is to determine the extent to which vaccination with our proprietary i-?VLP-based PD-L1 vaccine (PD-L1- ?VLP) can mimic the effects of passive PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy. This study will provide the basis for advancing this exciting approach into clinical trials. To create this vaccine, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the ability of PD-L1-?VLP to stimulate the production of antibodies that bind to tumor- associated PD-L1 and inhibit its binding to the T-cell immune checkpoint receptor, PD-1, in murine models. Aim 2. Determine the therapeutic effects of PD-L1-?VLP vaccination in a PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy-sensitive murine tumor model benchmarked against PD-L1 monoclonal antibody treatment. Aim 3: Determine whether potential immune-related adverse events including autoimmunity can be induced by our PD-L1-?VLP vaccine."

"9463808","The broader impact/commercial potential of PathoVax?s STTR phase I proposal is to improve outcomes of cancer immuno-therapy, utilizing a vaccine formulation combining an immunogenic chimeric virus-like particle (cVLP) vaccine with FDA-approved immune check-point inhibitors. PathoVax proposes to develop this technology for treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers. However, cancer vaccines have, in general, shown poor efficacy in clinical trials. We contend that their failure reflects inherent deficiencies in cancer vaccine technologies. Plasmid DNA vaccines are weakly immunogenic in humans. Live viral vectors possess inherent concerns including cross-reactive immunity and safety risks for immune compromised individuals. Peptides alone are poorly immunogenic and available adjuvants to enhance cellular immune responses have limited efficacy. To overcome the challenges faced by immunization and improve the treatment efficacy of immunotherapy, PathoVax has developed a novel technology for inducing T cell responses. PathoVax?s patented VLP with checkpoint inhibitors formulation leverages the current paradigm whereby cancer vaccines are likely to be most effective when combined with checkpoint inhibition. There is safety precedent for use of papillomavirus VLPs (Gardasil and Cervarix). Our VLP technology can prime the intratumoral recruitment of immune cells to sensitize once ?non-inflamed? non-permissive tumors to both cytotoxic-killing and checkpoint inhibitors. In preliminary studies, we have shown that our cVLPs displaying the HPV 16 E7aa49-57 Kb-restricted epitope induced robust CD8+ T cell responses and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in the TC-1 C57BL/6 mouse tumor model. Translation into the clinic will require antigens spanning the full length of HPV16 E6 and E7 proteins. Technical objectives of this Phase I proposal are focused on reformulating our vaccine to encompass these E6/E7 antigens, and characterize our cVLP to ensure a product with consistent features and biological activity upon translation into the clinic (Aim1). We will then utilize this final formulation to assess the efficacy of our characterized formulation in a clinically relevant mouse model of HPV+ OPC (aim 2). Successful implementation of this proposal will be the foundation for additional characterization and GLP efficacy studies in a Phase II STTR to create a robust pre-clinical data package for pre-IND FDA discussions. Positive results in the area of HPV-OPSCC (valued at US$85M globally) will also encourage extension of the technology as a platform to other cancers and infectious agents. Importantly, it provides a pathway to attract institutional investors or pharmaceutical partners for support beyond the STTR/SBIR process."

"9450944","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a serious side effect that causes morbidity and limits the dose of chemotherapy allowed to treat cancers. Of those receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy, approximately 30-40% of patients develop CIPN, yet the risk factors for developing this are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to test whether susceptibility to CIPN can be predicted in vitro by employing our novel CIPN-in-a-dish neurotoxicology assay that uses iPSC- derived sensory neuron from patient samples. In the first Specific Aim, sensory neurons (iSN) will be derived from patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (hereditary peripheral neuropathy). First, the CIPN-in-a-dish assay will be used to compare susceptibility between iSN from CMT patients and healthy controls. Subsequently CMT samples will have their deleterious gene mutation corrected using gene-editing technology (CRISPR/Cas) and CIPN susceptibility will be compared between the pathologic iSN and gene-corrected iSN. In the second Specific Aim, iSN will be derived from a cohort of patients with breast cancer that have received standard adjuvant paclitaxel chemotherapy. Again using the CIPN-in-a-dish assay, iSN from patients that have clearly developed CIPN from paclitaxel will be compared in a blinded fashion with patients that clearly have not. These studies will serve two important functions: 1) they are a ?proof-of-principle? study that determines whether this approach using patient samples can be used to predict CIPN in individual patients, 2) a hypothesis-generating study wherein patient samples will allow for directed studies of mechanisms of CIPN susceptibility. The potential future application of this technology will be to use a patient's own neurons to determine their susceptibility to the neurotoxic effects of specific chemotherapy, thus allowing for personalized precision medicine for the patient with cancer."
"9389968","Summary: This grant application continues my previous work, focusing on integrating stem cell biology, cancer stem cells and immunology to understand: i) mechanisms controlling stem cell numbers, self-renewal and differentiation; ii) the genetic/epigenetic `events' that drive cancer initiation and progression through clonal expansion and competition of stem cells; iii) mechanisms of programmed cell removal of precancerous cells by macrophage phagocytosis and how cancer cells evade those, and iv) developing innate system [mainly macrophage-based] cancer immunotherapies. I was awarded an NCI OIG 28 years ago and used the funding to develop the first method to identify and isolate blood forming stem cells [HSC]. We applied this discovery in a clinical trial where autologous transplantation of purified, cancer-free HSC from mobilized peripheral blood [MPB] to metastatic breast cancer patients following high dose chemotherapy, resulted in 33% 18-20 year survival compared to 7% with MPB. We then mapped the differentiation steps from stem cells to all mature blood cells and in the context of myeloid leukemogenesis, studied how genetic alterations modify the affected stem cells. We isolated leukemic stem cells[LSC] that could regenerate myelogenous leukemia and found that these cells were not phenotypic HSC but downstream MPP progenitors. Although many HSC in the same patients had the cancer-initiating mutations, they were not leukemic! Additional mutations or `events' were required, each promoting clonal expansion and competition of the preleukemic HSC over normal HSC. This model of sequential progression of events accruing one at a time in HSC `clones' until the LSC emerges holds true for all myeloid leukemias and preleukemias. Comparing LSC to HSC we discovered that the expression of CD47, a `don't eat me' signal for macrophage scavenger cells, was a late event for all cancers including leukemias. We made blocking antibodies to CD47, and found that these led to tumor cell phagocytosis and cancer regression and often cures in xenograft models of human leukemias and solid tumors. Anti-CD47 antibody synergizes with all other anti- cancer antibodies tested to date. The current proposal expands on these studies to test whether accumulation of mutations also occurs in a central nervous system stem cell(CNS SC) clone that gives rise to a brain cancer stem cell [CSC]. The gene expression profiles of cells from these precancers and cancers should identify new therapeutic targets. Importantly, normal C47+ cells aren't eaten when CD47 is blocked, because they lack a pro-phagocytic `eat me signal', calreticulin, that is on all cancers. We will study how cancer cells are labeled with calreticulin for elimination by macrophages, and extend our macrophage phagocytosis studies to try to understand how macrophages get rid of old, damaged, and dying cells, and how pathogenic stem cells avoid being eaten via CD47 or other `don't eat me' signals. In these studies we will examine additional stem cell systems that when gone awry lead to cancer and other diseases."

"9467372","PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital and acquired sensorineural hearing loss is often due to the absence or the degeneration of hair cells in the cochlea. Understanding the mechanisms regulating the generation of hair cells may therefore ultimately lead to better treatments for hearing disorders. To elucidate developmental mechanisms specifying the progenitor cells (i.e., prosensory cells) that generate the hair cells and support cells critical for hearing function, we propose to map the cis-regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) that precisely orchestrate where, when and how genes are expressed during the specification of prosensory cells in the developing cochlear duct. More specifically, we will determine chromatin accessibility with ATAC-seq and define developmentally regulated enhancers with H3K27ac ChIP-seq. In addition, it is our working hypothesis that Sox2 induces prosensory gene expression through direct transcriptional activator activity, and we will test predictions of this hypothesis using ChIP-seq for Sox2. Together, our integrated datasets will elucidate the downstream targets and mediators of Sox2 activity as well as the potential upstream inducers of Sox2 transcription. The data could potentially reveal a contribution of the epigenome to hereditary hearing loss. Through this mentored research plan and related training activities, the applicant will achieve new expertise in hearing research and genomic analysis. Results will reveal many new and complex interactions between gene expression, chromatin structure and transcription factor-binding across cochlear development, which will direct investigations into novel aspects of the fundamental mechanisms guiding the generation of the hair cells and support cells critical for hearing function."
"9473311","PROJECT SUMMARY Mechanisms Controlling Regulatory T Cell Effector Function in IBD. The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by immune dysregulation to components of the enteric microbiota. Findings from mouse models of IBD and recent human genetic studies highlight a critical, non-redundant role for the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 in the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis. Our lab has shown that Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are, overwhelmingly, the major source of IL-10 in the intestines. However, IL-10 is only produced by a subset of Treg cells?defined as ?effector? (e)Treg cells. In preliminary studies that used an IL-10 transgenic reporter mouse model to explore differences between transcriptomes of T cells separated on the basis of expression of IL-10, we identified the DNA-binding factor Gfi1 as a central repressor of Il10 gene expression in all subsets of CD4 T cells, including Treg cells. Gfi1 appears to act both directly, via interactions with the Il10 locus, and indirectly, by repressing transcription of Prdm1 (Blimp1), which is a trans-activator of Il10 in Treg cells. Additionally, Gfi1 represses other genes that appear to be central to eTreg function, suggesting that Gfi1 may play a key role in regulating the differentiation of eTreg cells. Finally, we have identified cytokine signals that induce the expression of IL-10 by Foxp3+ Treg cells. In essence, IL-10 expression by Treg cells is Iatent and requires activating cytokine signals that repress Gfi1 to derepress transcription of Il10 as part of eTreg cell programming. This could explain why IL-10 expression by T cells is largely restricted to the intestines at homeostasis, where on-going responses to the microbiota provide a state of controlled inflammation and a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote the development of IL-10? expressing eTreg cells. We hypothesize that inflammatory signals in the gut override Gfi1-mediated repression of eTreg cell development and that modulation of Gfi1 expression will impact the protective capabilities of Treg cells in an inflammatory environment?in large part through modulation of IL-10 expression. Further, we posit that Gfi1 maintains a pathogenic phenotype in CD4 T effector cells by repressing IL-10, such that inhibition of Gfi1 will convert pathogenic T cells to IL-10?producing protective T cells, thereby ameliorating intestinal disease. Herein, we will define mechanisms by which Gfi1 represses IL-10 in murine and human Treg cells and we will perform proof-of-principle studies to examine the impact on IBD pathogenesis of dysregulated expression of Gfi1 by T cells. The delineation of mechanisms by which cytokines modulate the Gfi1?Blimp1 axis to control IL-10 expression by T cells will lead to a better understanding of homeostatic networks that prevent IBD, and will provide a basis for discovery of novel therapeutic approaches by which endogenous IL- 10 can be up-regulated, and the differentiation and function of eTreg cells enhanced, to treat IBD."
"9567680","Clinical Protocol and Data Management ? Project Summary The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) function at the University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) resides within the Clinical Trials Office (CTO). The CTO, led by Stephen Williamson, MD (Medical Director of the CTO and Early Phase Clinical Research Program) and Hobs Apell, (Senior Executive Director) provides comprehensive support services that span the life cycle of cancer clinical trials from concept through manuscript. The CTO provides a central location for protocol management and reporting. There is a strong emphasis on assuring data integrity and compliance as well as emphasis on the education and training of CTO staff and investigators. There is also a strong emphasis on achieving timelines for rapid submission and activation of protocols while observing all regulatory requirements. To further translational research and mentorship goals, the Investigator-Initiated Trial Steering Committee (IITSC) was established in 2015. The IITSC, chaired by Williamson, and Scott Weir, PharmD, PhD (Associate Director for Translational Research), was formed to mentor and educate junior investigators and to support the acceleration of scientific discovery of novel therapeutics through the conduct of investigator-initiated clinical trials. Over the last four years, substantial progress has been made broadening clinical research partnerships with communities throughout our catchment area. Three major changes have expanded the composition of clinicians participating in the clinical trials process. The first change results from the incorporation of a large private practice oncology group by the University of Kansas Health System, a group now defined as the KUCC community oncology program. The second change is the expansion of the outreach network of KUCC, known as the Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA), which is a membership fee-based network of hospitals and physician groups located across the KUCC catchment area. Many MCA centers serve as affiliate sites to cooperative group sponsored trials and investigator-initiated trials conducted by KUCC as the Primary Center. The third change results from the 2015 consortium agreement with Children's Mercy incorporating their clinicians into KUCC programs. The CTO has enabled a steady increase in clinical trials accrual at KUCC since receiving NCI Designation. Accrual to Intervention clinical trial protocols increased overall by 21% (2,097 accruals in 2012 to 2,544 accruals in 2015). Accrual to Interventional investigator-initiated trials (IIT) increased by 12% (1,140 accruals in 2012 to 1,275 accruals in 2015). Notably, in 2015, institutionally sponsored IITs accounted for nearly 50% of all KUCC intervention clinical trial enrollments. Accrual to Industrial Sponsored Interventional Trials increased more than 160% (96 accruals in 2012 to 256 accruals in 2015). In summary, the CTO has facilitated significant growth of clinical research, while implementing cost-effective processes to ensure that the research activities have scientific merit, protect safety, and maintain scientific integrity."
"9516419","Recent advances in research conducted at Harvard Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Stem Cell Institute and later further developed at Semma Therapeutics, demonstrated that large quantities of insulin-producing cells can be generated from human iPSC. Since human iPSC can be derived from a simple blood sample from any patient, this technology now allows for generation of unlimited number of insulin-producing cells in a personalized manner. Other clinical research has shown that normal glycemic control can be restored in type 1 diabetes patients when they are transplanted with enough insulin-producing cells. The Boston Autologous Beta Cell Therapy [BAIRT] Program was formed between Brigham and Women Hospital (BWH), Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Stem Cell Institute (HSCI), Joslin Diabetes Center (Joslin), and Semma Therapeutics; this group aims to use these approaches to derive patient-specific iPSC lines, manufacture clinical grade insulin-producing cell products, and perform autologous cell transplants to treat diabetes patients. As part of the BAIRT program, the goal of the proposed project is to establish a cGMP standard operating protocol to derive iPSC lines from freshly collected human blood. The protocol has been developed by HSCI in collaboration with DFCI as well as input from other partners in the Boston Autologous Beta Cell Therapy Program. It is expected during the project period DFCI will establish the capacity and know-how to begin deriving and banking cGMP-grade patient-specific iPSC lines from blood samples collected from diabetes patients. Joslin and BWH have begun the recruitment of suitable candidates with diabetes resulted from pancreatectomies, so that research subjects will be available to provide their cells for iPSC derivation. The project will facilitate the testing and development of assays to characterize and qualify iPSC products intended for autologous cell therapies.

"9450002","Project Summary ? Research Infrastructure Core External and internal trends currently are converging at the UPR Medical Sciences Campus (MSC) that will shape the institutions' research portfolio for at least the next five years: 1) Scientists at the MSC perform studies at the molecular level that require Genomics and Proteomics approaches. 2) These studies generate large amounts of heterogeneous data, requiring the selection and application of Bioinformatics, Data Science, and computational techniques. 3) Researchers at the MSC's Institute of Neurobiology rely on cutting-edge imaging resources and specialized methods to learn about the structure and function of the nervous system. These tools are increasingly applied to other research areas at the MSC. 4) The threat of emerging infections is evidenced recently by the rise of Zika and Chikungunya in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and the Americas. The proposed Research Infrastructure Core (RIC) addresses these evolving trends by integrating resources in the areas of Genomics, Proteomics, Informatics, Neurogenetics, Bioimaging, and Infectious Diseases research into one, transdisciplinary, infrastructure core. The goal of the RIC is to function synergistically to maximize the quality and productivity of the research projects proposed in the Research Projects Core and in the pilot projects that will be funded through the Investigator Development Core, as well as to link RCMI faculty and scholars with other researchers at the institution. The RIC will also leverage other RCMI cores, including Administration, and Community Engagement. This Core will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) to combine Bioinformatics, Health Informatics and Operational Informatics resources into one Integrated Informatics Service; 2) to deliver high-end services to support Genomics and Proteomics research; 3) to provide state-of-the-art Neurogenetics and Bio-imaging services, and 4) to provide access to key resources for Tropical and Emerging Infectious Diseases research. The RIC will be managed by a faculty Core Lead assisted by five faculty Service Leads with relevant expertise. Technical staff will be responsible for daily operations. A central electronic ticket system, will allow users to request any service, to track progress and completion of services, and to register use of shared instrumentation. Another integrating element for the RIC is the charge-back system, which is managed centrally by the RCMI Program Administrator. Internal and external collaborations have been secured to avoid duplication of services. Instrumentation, hardware and most software required for the provision of these services is already operational. Funds are requested mainly for technical staff salaries and faculty-level-expertise time. The synergy among the RIC and its collaborating partners will facilitate basic and translational science research, stimulate studies on health disparities, and contribute to the development of a diverse biomedical workforce at the MSC."
"9443426","Abstract  Ribosomal movement along mRNA is an essential facet of protein synthesis in all organisms. During translation elongation the ribosome moves along mRNA in a codon-by-codon manner and unwinds mRNA secondary structure. However, specific mRNA sequences induce ribosome stalling and frameshifting. We aim to understand why these specific RNA sequences slow down ribosome translocation while the ribosome translocates through most mRNA structure without long pauses. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and an in vitro translation system assembled from purified components, we will define properties of frameshift-inducing RNA stem-loops and Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences that are critical for the ribosome pausing. Elucidating the role of RNA structure in the modulation of translation elongation is a key to understanding the molecular mechanism of ribosome frameshifting, which is essential for the synthesis of numerous bacterial, eukaryotic and viral proteins. For example, the production of protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depends on a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting event. Furthermore, ribosome pausing is a major determinant of numerous co-translational processes including protein processing, folding and targeting to membranes. Modulation of the translation elongation rate also affects mRNA stability and regulates levels of the produced protein.  In addition to codon-by-codon translocation, another type of ribosome movement termed ribosome scanning occurs during the initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotes. It is believed that during eukaryotic translation initiation the small ribosomal subunit is first recruited to the 5' end of mRNA and then scans the 5'- untranslated region (5'UTR) of the mRNA for the start codon. The molecular mechanism of scanning, which is critical for correct start codon selection, is poorly understood. Furthermore, the real-time movement of the small ribosomal subunit along the 5'UTR was never detected. We will use a single-molecule fluorescence microscopy assay designed to detect the movement of the small ribosomal subunit and measure the rate of the scanning. We will examine the mechanism of ribosome scanning and gain critical insights into eukaryotic translation initiation, deregulation of which is linked to a number of human diseases including cancer and diabetes.  Taken together, the proposed studies will substantially contribute to establishing the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis and provide a basis for the future development of antiviral and cancer therapies."
"9421148","Project Summary Harmful compounds and xenobiotics carried in inhaled air continually assault the nasal cavity and can cause severe nasal inflammation. Worldwide, hundreds of millions of adults and children suffer with asthma, rhinosinusitis, and other respiratory conditions. Environmental irritants and bacterial infections can trigger these types of nasal inflammation. In the nasal passages, the detection of inflammation triggers is mostly mediated by the trigeminal chemosensory system and the solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs). Known ligands of the SCCs are the bitter compound denatonium benzoate, used in several household products, and acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) generated by bacterial infections. SCCs, which express elements of the bitter taste (T2R) transduction cascade, are innervated by trigeminal nerve fibers, which relay their responses to the central nervous system, triggering release of neuropeptides into the mucosa, evoking inflammatory/immune responses and respiratory-protective reflexes to eliminate the irritating compounds. Denatonium and AHLs are prototypical compounds for the activation of the T2R pathway in SCCs. Thus, studying their effects on SCCs can increase our understanding of airway chemoreception and of long-term effects of exposure to SCC triggers. In this proposed research, we will determine whether SCC activation by denatonium and bacterial AHLs triggers avoidance behavior, preventing further inhalation of these irritants (Aim 1); whether the presence of denatonium triggers the same nasal inflammation and immune response as bacterial infections (Aim 2); and whether forced exposure to denatonium or AHLs can damage the olfactory epithelium and if SCCs are protective in these circumstances (Aim 3). Because social, work, and other situations often require people to ignore physiological warnings triggered by SCCs and stay in environments where irritating and toxic compounds are present, it is important to understand how SCCs function and to determine the chemosensory mechanisms and the physiological/behavioral effects of commonly encountered irritant compounds like denatonium. Understanding the transduction cascades and mechanisms involved in these responses will offer new selective pharmacological targets for several airway pathologies."
"9469243","PROJECT SUMMARY  Apoptosis negatively regulates cellular populations during both physiologic brain growth and the pathologic growth of brain tumors. In the postnatal cerebellum, apoptosis limits the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) and suppresses the formation of medulloblastoma, a tumor of excess neural progenitor proliferation that is the most common malignant brain tumor of children. My project will investigate the mechanisms that regulate apoptosis in CGNPs and apply this understanding to cerebellar hypoplasia and medulloblastoma. CGNPs proliferate in response to Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in the early postnatal period. Excessive SHH activation in CGNPs causes medulloblastoma, while excessive CGNP apoptosis can produce cerebellar hypoplasia. CGNPs maintain a specialized capacity for rapid apoptosis that is shared by medulloblastoma and mediated by interaction of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX and the anti- apoptotic homolog BCL-xL. It is unknown if specific mechanisms link SHH-driven proliferation and BCL- xL/BAX-regulated apoptosis in CGNPs.  I have generated preliminary data suggesting that BCL-xL and SHH activation cooperate to suppress apoptosis in both CGNPs and medulloblastoma. In transgenic mice, genetic deletion of Bcl-xL in the cerebellum results in symptomatic cerebellar hypoplasia, with increased apoptosis occurring in differentiating CGNPs. These findings suggest that in the absence of BCL-xL a redundant anti-apoptotic mechanism prevents cell death in CGNPs undergoing proliferation. This proposal uses the combination of genetic deletion of Bcl-xL and the pharmacological inhibition of SHH with the drug Vismodegib to determine the role of these two mechanisms in controlling CGNP survival and cell death. I will also determine the role of these mechanisms in medulloblastoma, and gain further insight into cell cycle dynamics and transcriptional changes through the use of FACS and Drop-sec. This project will elucidate the regulation of apoptosis in CGNPs and medulloblastoma, provide insight into the pathogenesis of cerebellar hypoplasia, and test the therapeutic potential of combined disruption of SHH and BCL-xL as a novel approach to medulloblastoma therapy. My proposal will give me critical training and experience in independent research, including mouse genetics, analysis of protein interactions, FACS, Drop-seq and bioinformatics, and ethical research conduct, while enhancing my scientific communication skills."
"9408734","PROJECT ABSTRACT Worldwide, about 1.9 million people became infected with HIV in 2015, most of whom live in Southern and Eastern Africa. In South Africa, the HIV incidence rate among female youth aged 15-24 (2.5%) is four times higher than their male counterparts (0.6%). Recent HIV prevention trials in South Africa documented incidence rates of 5-6% per year in 15-24 year old adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Given this high incidence of HIV, implementing effective HIV prevention strategies ? including PrEP ? is crucial to controlling HIV globally. The proposed study leverages existing community-based HIV counseling and testing platforms in South Africa and evaluates, using a mixed methods approach, a community-based prevention-effective PrEP adherence program in AGYW whilst optimizing the PrEP cascade. This study will take place in the urban Mamelodi Township in Gauteng Provence and rural Govan Mbeki sub-district in Mpumalanga Province, both of which are very high HIV transmission areas. Numerous barriers have been described that delay or block AGYW from accessing clinic-based health services, especially reproductive health and HIV testing and prevention services. Consequently, reaching AGYW at large scale with HIV prevention services requires the health system to think of delivery platforms outside of clinic-based facilities. Community-based counseling and testing programs have shown the greatest coverage and potential to achieve high levels of knowledge of HIV serostatus and linkage to HIV care. Using community-based counseling and testing programs, this proposal will deliver PrEP as part of a population-level combination prevention program which is necessary to substantially reduce HIV incidence. We propose to answer our key research questions through the following Specific Aims: 1) Assess adolescent girls and young women's uptake of PrEP when delivered through large- scale community-based HIV counseling and testing (CBCT) platforms in urban and rural settings in South Africa, 2) Evaluate community-based scalable interventions to achieve prevention-effective adherence to PrEP among AGYW, and 3) Measure differences in risk profiles of PrEP acceptors, non-acceptors and delayed initiators. In order to achieve Aim 1, we will leverage our on-going, at-scale CBCT program and platforms (mobile unit and systematic home-based testing) to identify and link AGYW to community-based PrEP initiation services. In order to achieve Aim 2, we will perform a 3-arm randomized control trial, with participants randomised to one of the following arms: Arm 1) a group-based community health club akin to an ART adherence club; Arm 2) one-on-one adherence counseling and support; Arm 3) community-based medication dispensary. And finally, while PrEP acceptors are being enrolled into the study as part of Aim 1, 516 individuals that decline PrEP will be enrolled as a control group to (a) measure the incidence of STI and HIV infections in PrEP acceptors and non-acceptors, (b): assess sexual behaviors and self- perception risk in those that accept and did not accept PrEP, and (c): determine the proportion of individuals that delay PrEP initiation and describe their reasons for delayed initiation."
"9328418","SUMMARY  During neural development, trillions of neurites intermingle in a complex environment in which they must recognize and connect with their circuit partners to achieve synaptic specificity. This ability implies that neurons are able to distinguish between each other?a mechanism likely involving cell type-specific molecular cues. One role of these cues is to prevent neurons from connecting with inappropriate partners. The retina is a valuable model system to study neural development due to its accessibility, well-characterized cell types, and laminar organization of inner retinal neuron synapses into a dense neuropil called the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Retinal neurons that share a role in visual processing synapse in discrete IPL sublaminae. If neurons leave their sublayer, or allow the wrong cells to enter their sublayer, they are at risk of wiring with the wrong partners. Thus, the establishment of these lamina-specific connections is critical for visual information processing and for visual perception. We are beginning to understand how retinal circuits come together in specific sublayers; however, it is still unclear how repulsive cues prevent circuits from crosswiring. The objective of this application is to determine how the integrity of one specific retinal circuit, the direction selective (DS) circuit, is established and maintained within the crowded environment of the IPL. The central hypothesis is that mutual repulsion between DS neurons and their neighbors establishes circuit integrity. The rationale for this work is that identifying the molecular mechanisms that mediate repulsion between adjacent retinal circuits will give insight into synaptic specificity in the retina and will likely be relevant for other brain circuits. Three specific aims have been formulated to directly test the central hypothesis: Aim 1) Identify molecule(s) that define the DS circuit IPL layers. Preliminary data suggest starburst dendrites can repel non- DS amacrines. The repulsive molecule FLRT2 is expressed by starburst and DS ganglion cell arbors; this proposal will determine whether it is responsible for this repulsion. Aim 2) Identify molecule(s) expressed by GAD65+ amacrines that exclude them from DS circuit IPL layers. GAD65+ amacrine arbors form sharp boundaries with DS circuit IPL layers. Preliminary data show these cells express Unc5c, a known repulsive receptor. Here it will be determined whether it mediates repulsion from DS circuit arbors. Aim 3) Identify molecule(s) that limit the DS circuit to a specific IPL territory. If DS circuit arbors left their defined sublayers, they could connect with inappropriate partners. The preliminary data suggest that FLRT2 can also function as a receptor to mediate repulsion; this Aim will test this idea. Together, these studies will reveal the specific repulsive interactions between adjacent neural circuits that drive synaptic specificity in the DS circuit. The knowledge gained from this study will serve as a conceptual framework for better understanding the establishment and maintenance of synaptic specificity throughout the CNS. This new information will be applicable to the fields of retinal development as well as neuroregenerative therapies."
"9564281","ABSTRACT  Gastroparesis (GP) is defined as delayed gastric emptying in the absence of a gross structural abnormality with the symptoms chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and abdominal distention. Pain or discomfort is frequently associated. A factor associated with improvement was anti-depressant use and factors associated with no symptom reduction included use of pain modulators, moderate to severe abdominal pain, and moderate to severe depression. The common theme of poor prognosis are factors which may arise from pathology that exist beyond just enteric motor function despite the fact that gastroparesis is indeed initially defined as an enteric motor disorder. Although the causes of gastroparesis can be multi-factorial, when the disease becomes chronic and the severity of the symptoms result in a high impact on Quality of Life (QOL), complex pathologies may begin to evolve in the enteric and central nervous system beyond just motor abnormalities contributing to other sensory defects. The neurobiology of these other factors needs to be explored further so that these insights can be translated into meaningful increases in treatment success in the moderate to severe gastroparetic patients. To accomplish these goals, we propose to create an additional site with the New England Gastroparesis Collaborative to join the NIH GR. The multi-center network will help recruit to our proposal to explore the peripheral and central neurobiology of gastroparesis and as well as help to conduct a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention to target these challenging pathologies. We plan to explore the relationships with gastroparesis symptoms, clinical co- comorbidities such as pain, depression, anxiety and catastrophization, and other GI physiological testing such as gastric emptying scitigraphy (GES), Wireless Motility Capsule (WMC), Electrogastrography (EGG) and Liquid Meal Satiety Drink Tests (SDT). We will perform a placebo controlled CBT trial in GP to examine the non- pharmacological impact of this treatment option on gastroparesis symptoms and the other clinical co-comorbidities such as pain, depression, anxiety and catastrophization. A subset of the CBT trial patients will undergo careful phenotyping pre/post intervention with brain MRI, AFT, and other GI physiological testing: GES, WMC, EGG and SDT to determine the impact of CBT on these physiologies. Characterization of these relationships or lack thereof can help guide future development of more targeted effective approaches in gastroparesis."
"9276256","PROJECT SUMMARY  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased more than 5-fold in the past three decades  while the prognosis has remained poor. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor of EAC.  Endoscopy (EGD) is the only method to diagnose BE but because EGD is expensive and screening is not  recommended very few EACs are detected in patients with pre-diagnosed BE. To make an impact on the  prevention and early detection of EAC the challenge is to first develop an alternative method for screening that  is less costly and safer than EGD while being acceptable and accessible. A non-endoscopic detection method  would allow screening in the primary care setting. Aberrant methylation of vimentin and other markers can be  detected in DNA extracted from endoscopic brushings in over 90% of BE subjects. The BETRNet focus of Project  2 is to directly translate these epigenetic markers of BE and EAC that we have discovered to clinically novel  methods for detection and risk stratification of BE. This project grows out of the discovery that methylated genes,  have the potential to be used as detection biomarkers for BE or EAC. This project:   1) Uses a novel non-endoscopic distal esophageal sampling method to determine the accuracy of   methylation markers as detection markers for BE;   2) Detects BE in an unscreened population of colonoscopy patients by assaying the optimal marker(s)   3) Determines whether a panel of aberrantly methylated genes associated with high grade dysplasia and   EAC can be detected in esophageal brushings or nonendoscopic distal esophageal samples to enable   risk stratification strategies;  Project 2 is clearly aimed at having significant translational impact at decreasing mortality from EAC through the  development of a convenient non-invasive screening program."
"9421875","PROJECT SUMMARY Developing sound strategies for prostate cancer control requires integrating information from a vast collection of clinical trials and observational studies and developing statistical and computer models to fill in inevitable evidence gaps. Management of prostate cancer is particularly controversial because of the absence of a consensus about optimal screening and treatment approaches. The PI of this application is a member of a team that develops statistical methods and computer models to advance sound prostate cancer policies. This work can only be done by a skilled specialist in cancer surveillance and statistical modeling. It demands expertise in complex statistical computing, which must be meticulously executed and validated, internally and externally. It requires outstanding writing skills to bring projects from the inquiry phase through the publication process, and it requires a proven ability to communicate and collaborate across multidisciplinary teams. The PI of this application has used these skills and others to establish his research group as a leader in prostate cancer modeling and policy. In this application he proposes to use these skills in support of new modeling analyses including (1) targeted screening in high-risk patient subgroups, (2) frameworks for decision making around novel biomarkers for screening and treatment, and (3) advancing methods to estimate overdiagnosis? the detection by screening of cancers that would never be diagnosed otherwise. Additionally, this application will support (1) developing online calculators and decision aids to assist clinicians and policymakers in selecting appropriate recommendations and (2) providing high-quality biostatistical service in a multi-project translational prostate cancer research program. The overarching aim is to optimize interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from this most common cancer in men."
"9408295","Abstract HIV infected adults who drink alcohol are already physiologically frail due to HIV infection, comorbidity (including hepatitis C infection), polypharmacy and associated substance use. In this setting, biomedical consequences of alcohol use can occur at lower risk use and may be unappreciated or misattributed. The ?Consortium to improve OutcoMes in HIV/Aids, Alcohol, Aging & multi-Substance? (COMpAAAS) is supported by NIH/NIAAA award U24AA020794 to study this issue in a single sample, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS). In this set of three applications, the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) and Kaiser Permanente (KP) teams join the Veterans Healthcare System (VA) team as COMpAAAS Tripartite: ART-CC, KP, and VA. Our long term goal is to inform intervention design and implementation. Together we will study biomedical consequences of alcohol and associated substance use in HIV extending the scope and generalizability of VACS from a single national healthcare system to 12 systems across 10 North American and European countries, doubling the HIV+ sample and substantially increasing the diversity of subjects. Importantly, COMpAAAS Tripartite also extends the pool of uninfected comparators (more women, young patients, and HCV+) available for analyses, a critical step if we are to understand how alcohol differentially affects individual biomedical outcomes by HIV status by gender, age, and HCV status. Using propensity and related methods and variables tailored to each aim and hypothesis, we will closely match HIV+ subjects with uninfected comparators drawing from 3.7 million KP members (1.9 million women) and 5 million veterans born in 1945-1965 (Birth Cohort, includes 450,000 HCV+). ART-CC, KP, and VA will also participate in an HIV+ substudy (n=2250), The Medications, Alcohol, Substance use in HIV Study (MASH), involving new, prospective data on potentially inappropriate medications (PIMS) and direct biomarker measurements for alcohol and associated substances (tobacco, marijuana, opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine). ART-CC, KP and VA have identical aims and protocols and contribute and share data. Aims compare HIV infected and uninfected individuals and address: 1) attributable risk from alcohol and tobacco for all cause and cause specific hospitalization and mortality; 2) the impact of alcohol and tobacco on primary and secondary preventative care; and 3) the role of alcohol and ART on drug interactions (potentially inappropriate medications) leading to adverse biomedical consequences. VA will coordinate sharing limited data sets based on the HIV Cohorts Data Exchange Protocol (HICDEP) a standardized format for data sharing. Standardized methods for data cleaning, imputation, and analyses will be employed."
"9481667","Project Summary (Abstract) Globally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of enteric GI infections that cause diarrheal disease every year. More disturbing, is that diarrheal disease caused by enteric pathogens kills over 2,000 children every day and is the second leading cause of death among children under the age of five. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common culprit of diarrheal disease in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for roughly 10% of all diarrheal deaths. EPEC infections are disproportionately high in children with HIV and cause more frequent and prolonged diarrhea episodes than in the uninfected counterparts. Despite the immune deficiency caused by HIV infection, EPEC is the only enteric pathogen that is frequently and consistently prevalent in this population, suggesting that more than just immune suppression may be involved in this relationship. Further, we have found that HIV uninfected children receiving the antibiotic cotrimoxazole (CTX) also have higher susceptibility and severity of EPEC infection. This is especially intriguing as both antibiotic use and HIV-infection have been correlated with a reduction in gut microbial diversity and has prompted us to hypothesize that the susceptibility and clinical severity of EPEC infection observed in HIV-infected and antibiotic-treated children is a consequence of a microbiome reduced in diversity, which promotes changes in the metabolic and virulence gene expression by EPEC. We will test this in two aims. In Aim 1 we will assess the microbiome as a potential modulator of EPEC virulence by performing 16S sequencing on HIV+ and antibiotic-treated children to confirm reduced diversity and to compare bacterial compositions, we will examine the association between EPEC strain and clinical outcomes and we will use germ-free mice reconstituted with human stool to evaluate whether changes in diversity impact EPEC infection. In Aim 2, we will determine genetic alterations in the clinical isolates using microbial transcriptomics and then we will determine whether the genetic data is correct by assessing virulence in an animal model and we will determine whether restoring microbial diversity via a fecal microbiota transplant would be an effective treatment option."
"9563491","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is establishing an infrastructure, the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR), to provide the extramural research community access to laboratory and statistical analyses to add or expand the inclusion of environmental exposures in their research. CHEAR is a multiunit infrastructure to provide access to comprehensive exposure assessment for NIH funded studies of Children's Health. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is applying to be the CHEAR Data Repository, Analysis and Science Center. The Center for Data Science (Data Center) will provide intellectual and logistical support for the maintenance, analysis, interpretation, curation, and reuse of data generated by CHEAR in support of extramural research projects. The Data Center will provide a repository for all data and support for statistical analysis and interpretation. Specifically, for the investigators that utilize CHEARfor studies of children's environmental health using the data generated within and outside the network, the Data Center will provide: 1) data repository and management; 2) statistical consultation and analysis services; 3) collaborative research support; 4) statistical and analytica methods development; and 5) data science resources. The ultimate goal of the Data Center is to maximize potential use and impact of exposure data both within and outside of CHEAR. The creation of the CHEAR Center for Data Science is critical for expanding our knowledge about the role of the environment in the growth, development, and health of children. Researchers who access the resources of the CHEAR Data Center will be able to go far beyond their initial hypotheses and potentially accomplish research that was previously thought infeasible or too costly. Indeed, through the use of the CHEAR Data Center, investigators will be able to increase their productivity and advance the scientific community's ability to examine the environment on an exposome scale. Pooling of multiple datasets in a cohesive and integrated manner will be made possible through the language standards that will be developed by the Data Center. Further, the Leadership is composed of world leaders in Environmental Epidemiology, Computer Science, Environmental Biostatistics, and Ontology who are ready and enthusiastic about carrying out the mission of the CHEAR Data Center as well as the CHEAR Network overall. Mount Sinai is uniquely positioned to provide these services; a Data Center already exists and will be expanded in both resources and infrastructure to meet the requirements of the CHEAR Network. Additionally, there is excellent Institutional support in both contributed additional funds and services for the Data Center. Thus, in sum, the children's health research community needs the CHEAR Data Center and we at Mount Sinai have everything that is needed to provide a state-of-the-art Data Center for the research community."

"9547030","Project Summary/Abstract Maintaining emotional stability in the face of negative life experiences is critical for healthy aging. Maladaptive responses to negative affective stimuli (?NAffecS?) are implicated in psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). In fact, there are shared brain regions involved in responses to NAffecS and MDD pathophysiology, including: hypothalamus (HYPO), amygdala (AMYG), hippocampus (HIPP), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventromedial and orbital prefrontal cortices (vmPFC, OFC), areas that are highly sexually dimorphic. Activity in this circuitry is physiologically associated with cortisol response, loss of parasympathetic cardiac tone, and immune responses, including TNF-?, IL-1?, IL-6, all of which differ by sex. We will test here that immune pathway abnormalities, beginning in fetal development, are associated with sex-dependent impacts on HYPO, HIPP, AMYG and PFC, resulting in maladaptive negative emotion processing and MDD/depressed mood symptomatology in early midlife, the latter of which will accelerate aging of this circuitry and negative emotion dysregulation in later midlife. We are uniquely poised to examine this for the first time in humans using data from our 55-year prospective prenatal cohort followed since 2nd/3rd trimesters of gestation and assessed at ages 44-50 in a previous NIMH study. Over 4 years, we will re-recruit 160 of these offspring who, 11 years later, will be ages 55-61, and relate maternal prenatal immune activity (TNF-?, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10) to sex differences in midlife NAffec circuitry decline and negative emotion processing dysregulation and the impact of MDD/severe mood symptomatology in early midlife. We will use the same multimodal imaging approach as previously (structural, functional imaging (sMRI/fMRI)) coupled with hormones, autonomic and immune physiology, and emotion regulation measures. Novel transcriptomic analyses in the offspring's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; measuring innate immune gene expression) will be related to adult midlife outcomes. Our lifespan perspective is an innovative approach to identify potential immunotherapeutic targets for maintaining healthy emotion processing that are sex-dependent and can be applied prior to functional decline. This will contribute to RDoC Negative Affect and Arousal phenotypes, physiology and genotypes, and impact of mood and sex."
"9465604","Palpation has been routinely used by physicians to diagnose diseases for centuries. In Clinical Breast Examination (CBE), medical personnel screen for suspect lesions (that are 10- to 20-fold stiffer than surrounding tissue) by palpation using two or three fingers followed by precession about a fixed 1-2 in2 contact area. Typical pressure to avoid discomfort and also feel deeper palpable objects ranges from 40-90 KPa. However, palpation is highly qualitative and subjective; and it is not possible to follow progression in the morphological changes. The goal of the proof-of-concept study is to develop an ergonomic, low cost (less than $5) stethoscope-like probe to capture tactile images during palpation. The probe will be pressed at 30-90 KPa pressure and a series of images will be recorded in real time by pivoting the probe over a fixed contact area of about 1-2 in2 in a precession motion similar to CBE. The studies will be performed over a well-characterized physical model, an artificial breast, and a clinical test on humans. The tactile image would be at a resolution of ~100 m to image ?5 mm features at 20-30 mm depth from the surface with relative hardness of ?10-fold compared to the surrounding matrix. Two key drivers for developing the technology are: (i) digitizing CBE will offer a screening record between biannual mammogram exams, for women below 40, and in low-income countries where accessibility to a mammogram is limited; and (ii) the current digital CBE instruments (with array of 1 mm size sensors compared to proposed 100 ?m size pixels) require rubbing the device on the skin at constant pressure and speed to create an image by stitching together the frames, potentially causing distortions/smearing due to dynamics of the palpable features. The grayscale of the image for the proposed device will be linear making the analysis quantitative to detect local hardness and score and track the palpation over time. The low power of the device will allow connectivity to a USB port for power, signal, and imaging on a laptop computer or smart phone. To image more complex body topography, such as axillary and cervical lymph nodes, the design will allow for interchangeable device heads of different sizes. At the heart of the proposed device is a ~100 nm thick nanostructured film that converts pressure to electrical signal to form the tactile image. The film is a stratified structure of a monolayer of Au nanoparticles interposed by ~5 nm thick polymer layers. On pressing the film, the electron tunneling current between the particles modulates to measure the local pressure. There are two specific aims: (i) develop an unpackaged device to prove the principle in terms of resolution, sensitivity, power requirement for USB connectivity, and ability to image 10-fold harder structures 3-10 mm in size at depths of 3-30 mm using a physical model; and (ii) develop a handheld device for testing on artificial breast model and limited clinical study with ~50 de-identified patients with breast- pain complaints or who are scheduled for mammograms. The preliminary and published results (by PI) indicate that the specified resolution, sensitivity, and performance are possible. A US Patent was issued in 2010."

"9562717","Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE ?4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities AD, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE ?4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population, and clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET-positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points ? baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD only, all measures) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population."

In 1997 PSID began to collect extensive data on children in the sample as part of the original PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS-I), which followed a cohort of PSID children aged 0?12 years. A second wave was collected on these same children in 2002/03 (CDS-II) when they were aged 5?18 years and a third wave was collected in 2007/08 (CDS-III) for children in this cohort who were aged 10?18 years. By 2014, children in the original CDS cohort had reached adulthood, and CDS was relaunched as ongoing study in which data collection is planned at regular 5?6 year intervals on all children aged 0?17 years in PSID families. The first round of the ongoing CDS was fielded in 2014?2015, and the next round is planned for 2019?2020. In all waves of CDS, extensive data on children's development, health, and wellbeing were collected from children's primary caregivers (PCGs, typically each child's mother) and from interviews with older children (aged 8+ years). A variety of additional information was collected in all rounds of CDS, in- cluding weekday and weekend time diaries, anthropometric measurements, home and neighborhood observa- tions, and saliva samples for subsequent genetic analysis (in CDS-2014). All of these data have been pro- cessed and documented and are being distributed?free of charge?to the research community through the PSID Online Data Center. In this project, we will create a new CDS Online Data Center, a public data archive that focuses exclusively on CDS and provides important new functions and enhancements that will help re- searchers use data from CDS efficiently and effectively with minimal start-up time. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) design and construct a new CDS Online Data Center to provide new and established data users with easier access to all waves of the original CDS and the new ongoing CDS; (2) enhance the new CDS Online Data Center through added functionality that allows data users to easily incorporate data from Core PSID about children's household, family, and parent characteristics throughout their lifetimes; and (3) publicize the availability of the new CDS Online Data Center to current and prospective data users. This project is sub- mitted in response to PAR-16-149, ?Archiving and Documenting Child Health and Human Development Data Sets,? and responds directly to the specific interest of NICHD in ?Creating data extraction web tools for public use databases, such as?the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement.? This project will facilitate secondary analysis by the scientific community of data within the scientific mission of NICHD and collected with NICHD support."

"9409295","PROJECT SUMMARY Simultaneous recording and stimulation of larger populations of neurons distributed throughout the brain is needed to rigorously evaluate theories of neural computation at the cellular level in mammals. Previously, we introduced close-packed silicon probes (Scholvin et al., 2016) and a direct-to-disk data acquisition architecture (Kinney et al., 2015) to enable 1000-channel neural recording in head-fixed animals (Preliminary Data). Through pilot studies we demonstrated the successful recording of terabytes of neural spiking activity (Preliminary Data), but also discovered some shortcomings of the architecture. Two design elements in particular were limiting. First, our headstages were too bulky for freely-moving experiments. Second, our acquisition hardware did not have the ability to quickly analyze all 1000 channels of data. As a result, it took days to weeks to understand the neural activity content of the terabyte-size recordings. For ultra-high-channel count neural recordings to become routine, the acquisition architecture must allow and facilitate rapid online and offline analysis of large amounts of data. A computer architecture with local data storage and analysis is favored, since a 1000-channel recording (e.g. 1000 channels sampled with 16 bits at 30 kHz) generates neural data at a sustained rate that exceed typical (gigabit ethernet) network connection speed to compute clusters or the cloud. Accordingly, we propose a 1000-channel silicon probe for freely-moving electrophysiology experiments in combination with a data acquisition system optimized for easy data analysis. ?The novel silicon probe will record and stimulate 1000 closed-packed sites, be compact enough for freely-moving rodent experiments, and reduce headstage cost by a factor of 10, down to $1 per channel. Furthermore, the re-designed acquisition hardware will not only capture 1000 channels of neural data and store to solid-state drive over a high-speed bus, but will now also copy the data to a GPU for spike sorting and RAM for visualization both online and offline. To test the system, we will perform 1000-channel freely-moving neural recordings in rodents, in collaboration with (at least) 3 labs with expertise (see letters of support)."

"9561329","Multiple factors in the cancer microenvironment down-regulate tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. In melanoma, one of the dominant mechanisms is the induction of co-inhibitory receptors on tumor-specific T cells and expression of corresponding co-inhibitory ligands by tumor or other cells within tumor stroma, leading to complete or partial loss of T-cell effector functions. Amplified co-inhibitory interactions in the cancer microenvironment impede not only immune tumor surveillance, but also therapeutic immune interventions that may explain the failure of approaches aimed at stimulation of T cells, including tumor antigen-based vaccination and T cell stimulatory cytokines. A prime example of the co-inhibitory interactions is the B7-H1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 pathway. Early studies from our and other laboratories demonstrate a critical role of this pathway in the evasion of cancer immunity, and blockade of this pathway enhances ongoing immune responses against tumors. Recent phase I clinical trials conducted using a fully human antibody to PD-1 demonstrated durable objective (partial and complete) responses in 33% of pretreated metastatic melanoma patients (n=46). Collectively, these studies support B7-H1 as an important co-inhibitory molecule in the down-regulation of immune responses in the melanoma microenvironment and blockade of the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway as one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of melanoma. Project 2 will extend these laboratory and clinical findings in three directions; The specific aims are: Aim 1: to assess the association between B7-H1/PD-1 expression in human melanoma microenvironment with clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy; Aim 2: to study effector mechanisms of the B7-H1/PD-1 blockade in augmenting anti-melanoma immunity and in melanoma regression; and Aim 3: to maximize melanoma therapeutic immunity by mechanism-based combinatory approaches. Based on our finding that B7-H1 expression by melanoma is directly and extensively up-regulated by interferons, the combination of B7-H1/PD-1 blockade will be tested with IL-2 and interferon-a 2b, and with selective mutant BRAF inhibitors, which promote tumor T-cell infiltration. Our studies should have direct impact for current development of B7-H1/PD-1 blockade as a novel and promising approach for melanoma therapy."
"9335654","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have enormous promise for regenerative medicine as they can differentiate into cells from all three embryonic germ layers. Further hPSCs provide a unique pre-clinical screening tool for evaluating disease mechanisms and therapies in patient samples. Despite the enormous potential of hPSC, many obstacles need to be overcome before the use of stem cells in cell-based therapy will be realized, including an incomplete knowledge of the growth factor cues regulating human skeletal muscle progenitor cell (SMPC) specification, growth and engraftment. In this proposal we will investigate the cellular cues required to direct skeletal muscle fate from hPSCs as seen during embryonic development. We will also develop the first screening approach to identify new regulators of human SMPC fate. It is imperative that we understand how to obtain SMPCs without genetic or viral manipulation. As an alternative approach we have developed a unique non-viral reprogramming platform, which results in superior delivery and reprogramming efficiency, and will be utilized to specify SMPCs without viral or genetic manipulation. We will compare the in vivo engraftment potential of growth factor directed versus reprogrammed SMPCs in a mouse model of DMD. The development of reprogramming strategies to direct SMPC fate and the identification of signals regulating muscle progenitor cell specification and maintenance could improve our basic understanding of human skeletal myogenesis as well as enhance our ability to generate scalable progenitors from humans for muscle disorders including DMD."
"9406413","PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT III: FUNCTIONAL AND ANATOMICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF DOMAIN-SPECIFIC  AND DOMAIN-GENERAL ALTERATIONS IN NEURAL SYSTEMS UNDERLYING  MATH & READING DIFFICULTY The goal of this high-risk/high-reward project will be to investigate, using a new and novel perspective, the neural underpinnings of reading and math difficulties. In particular, in a novel theoretical conceptualization, this project links specific neural systems to specific behavioral characteristics exhibited by individuals with learning disabilities. The center within which this project is embedded focuses on three types of behaviors proposed to be altered in reading and math disability: processing speed, domain-specific processes that are needed to enable a given ability (e.g., word recognition for reading; numerical sense for math), and executive processes that aid in selecting and prioritizing specific information to support domain-specific processes. This project tests a model which posits that alterations of each of these three behaviors is associated with alterations in each of three specific aspects of neural function. The project will examine whether slowed processing speed, which is observed trans-diagnostically across reading and math disability, is associated with poorer overall integration and coordination of information across the brain. Brain organization will be assessed by state-of-the art methods. In one method drawn from graph theory, the brain is conceptualized as consisting as a set of nodes or regions, with the connections between them acting as a route for information flow (much like an airline network). The hypothesis to be tested argues that the first behavioral characteristic, slowed processing speed, will be associated with reduced efficiency of information flow through the brain. In the other method, the brain is divided into intrinsic connectivity networks, where brain regions whose activity co-varies together over time are grouped together (much as the world is composed of different alliances such as the European Union and North American Free Trade Association). From this perspective, it is proposed that in individuals with slowed processing speed, processing within these networks is not well insulated from one another. The project will also test the hypothesis that the second behavioral characteristic, domain-specific deficits (i.e., math difficulties, reading difficulties) are reflected in altered processing in brain regions critical to a given domain. In the case of reading, such critical areas include the language-related superior temporal/inferior parietal regions along with inferior frontal regions of the left hemisphere. For math, the critical region is the intraparietal sulcus. Finally, the project will test the hypothesis that those individuals with learning difficulty who also exhibit executive dysfunction, the third behavioral characteristic, will show alterations in function of lateral prefrontal regions, as well as disrupted connectivity of this region to posterior regions involved in domain-specific (e.g., math, reading) processing. So as to increase relevance for the identification and treatment of individuals with learning disability, an additional project goal will be to determine whether these neural markers can be used together with one another to predict the level of reading (or math) difficulties exhibited on an individual-by-individual basis. To meet these ambitious goals, the project brings together scientists with requisite areas of expertise."
"9546014","Project Summary Adipocytes serve as the body?s primary site for lipid storage and act as signaling centers to coordinate the physiological response to an organism?s nutritional and metabolic state. Therefore, to understand susceptibility to obesity and type 2 diabetes requires a detailed understanding of the molecules underlying the function of adipocytes. The transcription factor PPAR? is a master regulator of adipogenesis and regulates the transcription of genes involved in glucose transport, lipid metabolism, and a number of adipokines. However, the mechanism by which PPAR? regulates transcription in adipocytes remains incompletely understood. This proposal will improve our understanding of the mechanism of PPAR? transcriptional regulation by studying a novel positive regulator of PPAR? signaling, Zfp407, that was recently identified by our lab. We hypothesize that Zfp407 in adipocytes regulates cell survival by controlling PPAR? signaling as a novel scaffolding cofactor. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data demonstrating that Zfp407 deficiency in cultured adipocytes broadly reduces the expression of PPAR? target genes while in vivo Zfp407 deficiency in adipocytes greatly reduces fat mass. In Specific Aim 1, we will test whether constitutive and temporal deletion of Zfp407 specifically in adipocytes alters adipocyte survival and function and determine the metabolic consequences. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply genome-wide analysis of transcription factor binding in adipocytes together with biochemical and cell biological approaches to determine the molecular mechanism by which Zfp407 regulates PPAR? activity. Collectively, these studies will improve our mechanistic understanding of adipocyte function and PPAR? signaling, which are together critical for understanding the pathophysiology of metabolic disease and discovering new therapeutic targets."
"9562187","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The recent FDA approval of the SPECT imaging agent I-123 labeled DaTscan for diagnosis and monitoring progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD) has open up a new era in SPECT brain imaging. Unlike with perfusion imaging where the entire brain is the volume of interest, with PD the structures of interest are the putamen and caudate (and potentially substantia nigra) which lie in the interior portion of the brain. However imaging of the occipital lobe is also required with PD for calculation of the striatal binding rati (SBR), a parameter of significance in the early diagnosis and differentiation of PD from other disorders with similar clinical presentations.  Our hypothesis is that combining a specifically designed multi-pinhole (MPH) collimator on one detector head with a fan-beam collimator on the remaining head of current dual-headed SPECT systems, coupled with iterative reconstruction with modeling system spatial resolution, will result in improved detection and quantification of structures in the interior region of the brain at marginal cost (the price of collimator(s) and reconstruction software). The MPH collimator would be designed to provide enhanced spatial resolution / sensitivity for the interior of the brain. The fan-beam collimator would provide lower resolution but complete sampling of the brain addressing data sufficiency and allowing a volume-of-interest to be defined over the occipital lobe for calculation of SBR's. Clinically this would provide a low-cost system allowing improved visualization and relative quantification of function of structures in the interior region of the brain, potentially as small as the ~4 mm substantia nigra, which cannot currently be achieved by other than expensive, brain dedicated, SPECT systems. This would greatly impact the early detection and differentiation of PD, and possibly other neurological disorders as new SPECT imaging agents are approved.  Our approach for further investigating our hypothesis is based on the initial exploration we have conducted under funding provided by NIH R21 EB016391 and is organized into five specific aims. The first specific aim is to complete the optimization of the MPH collimator design through task-based optimization for the tasks of detection using the Channelized Hotelling Observer (CHO) and quantification of striatal function by calculation of the SBR. The second specific aim is to finish development of inclusion of MPH system geometry and response in reconstruction. The third specific aim is to have our colleagues at the Center for Gamma Ray Imaging (CGRI) at the University of Arizona construct the MPH. The fourth specific aim is to install and test the combined fan-beam and MPH system on a SPECT/CT camera using phantoms. Our fifth specific aim is to image five patients with the combined system."

"9551197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and accounts for 20% of all primary brain tumors. GBM has a median survival rate of only 14.6 months despite current best treatment practices including surgery and chemoradiation. A significant reason for this morbidity and mortality is the ability of GBM to invade normal brain parenchyma, making localized treatment ineffective. There is increasing evidence of a small subset of cells, brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) that are responsible for the disease's treatment resistance. In order for treatment to be effective, these invading cells need to be targeted. One promising approach involves the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have been found to migrate preferentially to and home in on cancer cells. Moreover, MSCs can be engineered to synthesize and release anti-tumor proteins, like bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), which affects BTICs. MSCs can be obtained from bone marrow (BM- MSC) and adipose tissue (AMSCs). BM-MSCs are difficult to obtain, have limited ex vivo proliferation capacity, and decrease in effectiveness with donor age. Unlike BM-MSCs, AMSCs are more abundant in supply, easier to obtain from fat tissue, express higher levels of surface markers implicated in cell migration, and have been shown to resist oncogenic transformation. AMSCs may therefore be a better option. The viral gene delivery method, though commonly used to modify AMSCs, is associated with insertional mutagenesis and immunogenicity, and, therefore, has potentially limited translational ability for use in human patients. Biodegradable, polymeric nanoparticles enable effective non-viral gene delivery to multiple cell types, including human AMSCs (hAMSCs), while avoiding the problems typical of viruses. In this grant, we propose a novel technology to combine Freshly-extracted Adipose Tissue (F.A.T.) and nanoparticles to non-virally engineer the primary hAMSCs contained within F.A.T without prior culture to secrete anti-cancer proteins while maintaining the cells' ability to migrate toward tumo cells. Our overall hypothesis is that nanoparticle-modified hAMSCs obtained from F.A.T. retain their tumor suppressive characteristics in a clinically relevant in vivo human GBM model. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims: (1) To effectively deliver exogenous genes of interest to Freshly-extracted Adipose Tissue (F.A.T.) from patients via lyophilized biodegradable nanoparticles. (2) To determine if nanoparticle-modified BMP4-secreting hAMSCs retain an anti-glioma effect in vitro. (3) To determine the safety and efficacy of nanoparticle-modified BMP4-secreting hAMSC treatment in combination with targeted radiation therapy on human GBM in an in vivo murine model. Aim 1 involves investigation and optimization of a unique technology of combining nanoparticles with F.A.T. from our patients. For aims 2 and 3, using nanoparticles already tested in commercial hAMSCs, we will now investigate the modification of primary hAMSCs that have been isolated and cultured prior to adding the nanoparticles. The techniques to be used in vitro and in vivo in this proposal have been developed and further characterized by our teams. In vitro studies will be conducted using new advancements in the fields of microfluidics and nanobiotechnology. In vivo studies will employ a mammalian xenograft model that engrafts human GSC-derived GBM, which bests recapitulates human GBM. Further, in the in vivo studies, animal subjects will be treated with radiation using Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP), thus recreating traditional conformal beam radiotherapy for humans on the scale of a mouse. The results of this study will determine whether nanoparticle-modified hAMSCs can provide a treatment that is safe and effective for not only patients with GBM, but many types of primary and metastatic brain cancers. For future clinical application, the nanoparticles could be administered either to hAMSCs obtained from patient fat after culturing for a few days or then given IV as a treatment or to F.A.T. with the resulting engineered hAMSCs re- administered during surgery. This may lead to clinical trials, with a revolutionary new way of treating patients with brain cancer and facilitating personalized medicine."
"9408764","Radikal Therapeutics (RTX) is developing a pioneering therapy to restore immunotolerance and arrest progressive depigmentation in vitiligo. At our partnering institution, Loyola University Chicago, a variant to inducible Heat Shock Protein 70 was developed with remarkable potential for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune vitiligo. Carrying only a single amino acid modification to the protein, this variant HSP70iQ435A (?CM?) was found to have a curative effect involving long-lasting tolerization of dendritic cells (DCs) and inhibition of T cell influx to the skin. In the Phase 1 SBIR we examined the CM in a model of spontaneous depigmentation in Sinclair swine, characterized by regressing melanoma and newly developing vitiligo. Paralleling the clinical presentation, in this system the inflammatory CD11b+CD11c+ subset of DCs held responsible for precipitating and perpetuating vitiligo is found in increased abundance among circulating and skin infiltrating DC. We observed that untreated lesions in the control group gradually increased in size by 32%, whereas repigmentation of 37% was observed in CM treated lesions (p=0.0045). This change in cutaneous pigmentation was associated in treated pigs with a 50% reduction in infiltrating T cells (p<0.04). We thus hypothesize that the CM-encoding DNA will likewise interfere with progressive depigmentation in human vitiligo patients, providing incentive for the development of the CM into a marketable drug. Aim #1: Scale-up and produce GMP-grade CM The PI will synthesize de novo a high-producing E. coli clone expressing the CM plasmid. RTX will finalize optimization of the growth conditions, develop product-specific HPLC release assays, and generate a reference standard. Aldevron will generate a Master Cell Bank and Working Cell Bank expressing the CM, and generate a g GMP batch of the CM in order to support clinical Phase 1a safety and efficacy investigations in clinical vitiligo, and to perform stability analysis. Analytical methods will be developed to characterize the CM for GMP release and stability studies. Aim #2: Relate CM treatment efficacy to disease duration in a murine model of vitiligo. RTX will measure efficacy of the CM in relation to disease duration in h3TA2 mice with progressive vitiligo. We will treat mice 6-36 weeks at age at onset to measure disease arrest and repigmentiation by scanning. Aim #3: Establish the acute safety, toxicity, and tolerance of CM in GLP toxicology studies required for FDA IND application. RTX will carry out a 13-week GLP study wherein the CM is dosed via a subcutaneous route of administration in order to elucidate the NOAEL in mice and provide the basis for the dose range to test for safety and tolerance in man. Aim #4: Compile and prepare a pre-IND application to the FDA RTX will prepare and submit regulatory documentation to support a clinical GCP Phase 1a study to evaluate the safety of the CM in human volunteers with active vitiligo. RTX will meet with the FDA to present our efficacy data to gain concurrence on a clinical registration pathway leading to drug registration in 2022."
"9432056","Project Summary/Abstract  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine cancer with no effective targeted therapies. Identifying therapeutic targets in SCLC has been challenging, partly because driver mutations in SCLC are primarily loss of function, involving the tumor suppressor genes RB1 and TP53. While TP53 is highly mutated in many adult solid tumors, the near-universal loss of RB1 (protein pRB) is unique to SCLC. I propose to identify new therapeutic targets in SCLC by investigating epistatic and synthetic lethal interactions with pRB loss, with the former being targets acting downstream of pRB and the latter representing dependencies created specifically by pRB loss. I have employed both of these strategies to identify two novel targets, KDM5A and AURKB, that are required for SCLC proliferation and whose specific function is to regulate neuroendocrine differentiation and chromosomal segregation, respectively. In Aim 1, I will use biochemical and genetic approaches to determine the specific mechanism by which KDM5A regulates ASCL1, a pulmonary neuroendocrine lineage transcriptional activator that is required for SCLC tumor formation. In Aim 2, based on my preliminary data from a CRISPR screen, I hypothesize that other regulators of chromosomal segregation are synthetic lethal with RB1 loss. I will use direct fluorescence-based competition assays to validate true synthetic lethal interactions. I will then use time-lapse microscopy to determine the underlying mechanism by which pRB loss exacerbates the mitotic phenotype caused by loss of other chromosomal segregation genes. In Aim 3, I will ask whether KDM5A is necessary for tumor initiation and/or tumor maintenance in vivo using a novel CRISPR-based genetically-engineered mouse model of SCLC that I developed.  I'm a medical oncologist with a research background in cancer biology applying for a K08 award with a long-term goal of becoming a tenure-track independent laboratory investigator. I envision developing an independent research program investigating the mechanisms responsible for SCLC pathogenesis with the ultimate goal of identifying new therapies for SCLC patients. During my proposed K08 research training, I will perform mentored research in the laboratory of Dr. William Kaelin at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). I plan to spend 90% of my time on research and 10% on patient care seeing thoracic oncology patients. I have organized an outstanding advisory committee to help guide my research and career development with faculty members at DFCI, Harvard Medical School, and MIT that are experts in specific areas of my proposed research including: Dr. Stuart Orkin, Dr. David Pellman, Dr. Tyler Jacks, and Dr. Stephen Blacklow. Dr. Bruce Johnson, a world-renowned lung cancer clinical trialist, will serve as my clinical advisor. This outstanding environment at DFCI supplemented with coursework and conferences will help me achieve my long-term career aspirations. "

"9552453","Project Summary  The cytoskeleton is essential to many aspects of life, cell division and motility being prime examples. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the roles of two actin nucleators, Spire (Spir) and Cappuccino (Capu). We are studying these protein in Drosophila, where they are known to be essential to polarity establishment during early development. Spir and Capu build an actin mesh that traverses the Drosophila oocyte throughout mid-oogenesis. The presence of the mesh and its removal at the correct developmental stage are both critical to polarity establishment. Thus learning how Spir and Capu collaborate to build the mesh is essential to a fundamental understanding of how they contribute to polarity establishment during development. In the proposed work, we will focus on two aspects of Spir-Capu operation: 1) the mechanism by which they assemble actin filaments and 2) how Spir and Capu are spatially and temporally regulated, in order to establish the actin mesh and then remove it when appropriate. We have developed a working model in which Spir and Capu are both active throughout mid-oogenesis (stages 5-9); Spir enhances nucleation by Capu, specifically at membranes; together they build a dynamic actin mesh until stage 10 when Spir and Capu protein levels drop, the mesh disappears, and streaming begins. We will test this model using both in vitro and in vivo approaches with assays that span scales from single molecule fluorescence microscopy to whole animal genetics. Testing this model will lead to a mechanistic understanding of two proteins, conserved throughout metazoan species. It will advance our knowledge of the cytoskeleton and how it is controlled. Given the co-existence of this pair of proteins in polar cells, including neurons and epithelial cells in mammals, it has been proposed that their role as polarity factors in Drosophila is conserved. Thus we anticipate that what is learned about Spir and Capu in Drosophila oogenesis will be applicable to our understanding of the cytoskeleton, cell polarity, fertility, development and health in many animals, ranging from Drosophila to humans."
"9450133","Abstract  The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) proposes to establish a RCMI - Center for Health Disparities  (RCHDR) to conduct cutting edge research for addressing health disparities. The Center is a collaborative effort  within multiple NCCU units and will be housed at the Julius L. Chambers Biomedical/Biotechnology Research  Institute (BBRI). Focusing on basic and behavioral biomedical research, the Center will leverage resources and  partnerships at the neighboring institutions in the Research Triangle area, community based organizations and  the nationwide RCMI Translational Research Network (RTRN) to advance the following specific aims: (1)  Enhance the research capacity of NCCU within the areas of basic biomedical and behavioral research by  conducting three innovative and significant research projects; and developing a strong research infrastructure  core and community engagement core where investigators will have access to the tools for basic/biomedical and  behavioral sciences; (2) Prepare and enable all levels of investigators (including postdocs, research track,  tenure-track and tenured faculty) to become successful extramurally funded health disparities researchers by  developing an Investigator Development Core (IDC) and providing funding for pilot projects focused on health  disparities research with robust mentoring by an experienced investigator from NCCU and/or partnering  institutions; (3) Provide ancillary activities and promote a collaborative environment conducive to career  enhancement by offering a multitude of career enhancement activities and collaborative events; and (4) establish  sustainable relationships with neighboring research and community-based organizations and RTRN network to  advance cutting edge health disparities research at NCCU. Leveraging the existing biomedical commitment of  NCCU and establishing such an integrated RCMI Center at NCCU will greatly enhance the research capacity at  this HBCU and drive it towards achieving its mission of addressing health disparities."
"9463213","Errors in the planning and delivery of radiation therapy can result in inferior outcomes for patients. The magnitude of this problem is now well-appreciated from cooperative group trials and other sources. At present, however, there are few concrete tools to reduce the chance of plan errors passing undetected. Current practice uses a variety of error mitigation means such as human inspection of the radiation treatment plan or rule-based checking of plan variables. However, research has shown that many errors are still missed. As radiation therapy becomes more complex and varied, and as the demands on staff increases, new methods are needed. Our development will result in an independent means of verifying that the type of radiotherapy treatment and the way it is prescribed are in keeping with the standards already in place within a specific clinic. The software system will be capable of comparing every treatment variable with what would be expected for a given type of disease and location. With the large number of variables now created for complex radiotherapy treatments ranging into the hundreds, human checking for consistency of treatment technique after treatment plan generation is impractical. The tools created in this proposed project will provide the ability to cross check an entire area of treatment planning that is largely overlooked in today?s radiotherapy clinics."
"9542523","Because of its high sensitivity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of many infectious diseases, but generally only implemented in well-equipped laboratories. One of the major roadblocks for expanding PCR to point-of-care markets is the lack of simple, robust, single tube PCR designs which preserve its laboratory-based high sensitivity and specificity. In this Fast-Track STTR application BioVentures, Inc. and Vanderbilt University, a nearby research institution, propose to develop a fundamentally different PCR design, hybridization-triggered PCR (HT-PCR). It alters the way PCR cyclic amplification is monitored and controlled, resulting in a design more suitable for underserved point-of-care markets. The HT- PCR technology (co-invented by the applicants) meshes well with BioVentures's successful business model of manufacturing and selling molecular biology reagents and aligns with its strategy to expand into the clinical diagnostic market. Phase I and II Aims evaluate the feasibility and advantages of this approach with studies to detect DNA biomarkers of three major infectious diseases.  One of the major impediments to simple, robust, single tube PCR is that an efficient amplification reaction requires a narrow range of thermal and chemical conditions. Point-of-care settings, including walk-in clinics, rural health outposts, and outbreak surveillance by mobile response units, generally lack the stringent sample preparation and controlled environmental requirements available in centralized laboratories. The fundamental limitation with all current PCR designs is that thermal cycling is controlled by pre-determined indirect temperature measurements, yet the PCR product melting step and, more importantly, the primer annealing step, do not always occur at the programmed temperatures. Individual reaction conditions, ambient temperatures, and thermal calibrations create disparities between the expected hybridization state of the product or primers and the actual hybridization state. These disparities are exacerbated in diagnostic settings that are less equipped to precisely control environmental conditions and sample contents, leading to PCR failure, i.e., false negatives. We propose an alternative PCR design that dynamically controls thermal cycling by optically sensing the annealing and melting of mirror-image L-DNA surrogates of the reaction's primers and targets. Because the properties L-DNA enantiomers parallel those of natural D-DNAs, the L-DNA reagents are used to indicate the cycling conditions required for effective primer annealing and product melting during each cycle without interfering with the reaction. A major advantage of this approach is that it enables hybridization- triggered heating and cooling without the need to know reaction temperatures and times. Thus the instrument dynamically adapts to unpredictable thermal and chemical variations. A second major advantage is that the L- DNA surrogates of the PCR product can also be used as controls for reagent rehydration, sample preparation, instrument performance, diagnostic threshold, and correct product formation, enabling well-controlled single- tube analysis of DNA."
"9416008","Project Summary/Abstract Administrative Core ?A comprehensive whole-brain atlas of cell types in the mouse? proposal consists of four Research Segments: Molecular Signatures, Anatomy, Functional Measures, Cell-specific Targeting Approaches and Tools; a Data Core and an Administrative Core with six PIs and eleven collaborative sites. To address the operational management of the Center, including fiscal management, project management, strategic planning, progress reporting, and support for collaboration and communication, an Administrative Core will be established to provide the necessary leadership and organizational structure to achieve the goals and milestones as well as to coordinate and integrate with the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and BRAIN Cell Data Center (BCDC). The Administrative Core will provide the structure that fosters communication and collaboration among the Center members by organizing the Center into a Steering Committee, Project Teams, and an Administrative Core Subcommitee to oversee the collaborative, standardized, and on-time data generation, analysis, and public data sharing process. In addition, the Administrative Core will establish the infrastructure and tools for coordination and communication among the Center members. Project management best practices, such as milestones, progress reporting and tracking, collaborative software programs, and a responsibility matrix are just some of the tools that will be applied to the Center to ensure achievement of performance objectives and milestones, optimized communication, and resource utilization and prioritization. Further, the Administrative Core will support the implementation of standard operating procedures and quality control standards for data generation, data processing, and analysis. To produce a high-quality atlas of cell types in the mouse brain, rigorous standardization and quality control practices will be adopted by all members. This adoption will also facilitate the data transfer and data integration with the BCDC. Finally, the Administrative Core will implement and maintain fiscal and subcontractor management processes for all members. With the implementation of this entire infrastructure, we anticipate that this project and the resources it produces will have a broad and meaningful impact on the generation of a comprehensive 3D brain cell reference atlas."
"9447473","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (Community Engagement Core) The Community Engagement Core (CEC) purpose is to develop an education delivery format that promotes inclusivity and awareness with the general aim of increasing research participation and retention of local citizens through collaborations between community residents and the RCMI faculty. Our population in the Tuskegee/Macon County area is primarily low income and African American, a group that reports high rates of distrust in scientific exploration and in healthcare delivery. We hypothesize that residents connect with research by understanding how scientific outcomes affect them. Therefore, in our Specific Aims, we are proposing an education dissemination strategy that begins at the community-level. The specific aims include the following: Specific Aim 1: Convene a council of community representatives and RCMI faculty to complete a needs assessment containing community-based recommendations for dissemination of effective obesity and HIV education. Specific Aim 2: Engage residents in town hall meetings serving as a medium for dissemination of faculty research. Measure the effectiveness of these meetings through surveys. Compare survey outcomes. Specific Aim 3: Develop a model of optimal participation based on the scientific assessment of town hall meetings. Specific Aim 4: Promote community-engaged, interdisciplinary learning and mentorship. To facilitate the aims, our research will leverage the organizational resources of local community foundations and human capital resources from Tuskegee University. We will also empower a group of Health Equity Resource Officers (HERO) to serve as liaisons between the community and research faculty."

"9396635","Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD."
"9451896","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Placental dysfunction, most commonly manifested as preeclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction, is an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in both the developing and developed world. It is thought that placental dysfunction arises from abnormal trophoblast differentiation and/or invasion, events that occur in the first trimester of pregnancy, but become clinically apparent only in the late second and third trimesters. Optimal surveillance and management of placental dysfunction, as well as the development of effective therapies, have been hampered by the lack of methods for early and accurate identification of pregnancies at risk for this disorder. This project aims to develop such a method. The goal of Aim 1 will be to identify candidate Extracellular RNA biomarkers for prediction of clinically relevant placental dysfunction from a high-risk cohort. Aim 2 will focus on validation of these biomarkers in an average-risk cohort. Aim 3 will include development of a CLIA certified assay and application of this assay in a pilot randomized control trial to assess the clinical and cost impact of screening  general obstetric population for risk of placental dysfunction, and referral of screen-positive patients to a higher level of surveillance. This project is a collaboration between academia (UCSD) and industry (Sera Prognostics) and will leverage existing and in-progress resources, including the Placental Dysfunction Clinic at UCSD, the plasma and serum biobank collected from average-risk pregnancies at Sera Prognostics, and the UCSD Obstetric Registry. The research team includes investigators with diverse and complementary strengths, including expertise in maternal fetal medicine, clinical research, epidemiology, genomics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and clinical assay development. The immediate application of a simple and accurate method to predict risk of clinically relevant placental dysfunction to obstetric care will be to enable targeting of clinical resources to high-risk cases, while sparing low risk patients unnecessary anxiety. Longer term benefits will arise from using this method to increase the safety and power of clinical trials of candidate therapies by targeting high-risk patients, thus enhancing the detection of any therapeutic effects and subjecting only the patients most likely to benefit to potential risks associated with the therapy."
"9551206","ABSTRACT Bone is a highly dynamic organ that undergoes continuous remodeling and maintains a balance between bone formation and resorption. Bone cells, osteoblasts, which contribute to new bone formation, and osteoclasts, which resorb bone tissue, act in concert to maintain bone homeostasis. A perturbation to these highly coordinated cellular activities often results in bone metabolic and degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a disease of dysregulated bone homeostasis characterized by low bone mass and a significant increase in fracture risk. This pathological condition represents a major public health problem with osteoporosis-associated fractures occurring in an estimated one in two women and one in four men age 50 and older in the United States alone. We recently showed adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B), a G-protein coupled receptor on the cell membrane, plays an important role during osteogenic and osteoclastic differentiation of MSCs and macrophages respectively. These findings along with our ongoing studies highlight the potential of ADORA2B as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases characterized by low bone mass such as osteoporosis. Unlike most of the currently available drugs that only slow down disease progression but do not promote bone formation, activation of ADORA2B offers a therapy with dual function that promotes osteoblast differentiation (bone formation) while inhibiting osteoclast activity (bone resorption). By employing a number of in vitro and in vivo models, we will: (1) study the role of ADORA2B on osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and unearth the underlying intracellular signaling mechanism, (2) determine the therapeutic potential of targeting ADORA2B to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis by using an ovariectomized mouse model, and (3) establish humanized osteoporotic bone in animal models. Targeting ADORA2B to treat bone loss is not limited to the study of osteoporosis but has broad applications that can be extended to treatment of various bone metabolic diseases. The humanized bone tissue models could lead to new enabling technologies for drug discovery and overcome species-specific discrepant findings in preclinical studies."

The WC-CHEAR will bring together the tremendous resources, capabilities and expertise of the NY State Department of Health's public health laboratory and biomedical research facilities in Albany, NY with those of the NYU School of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology. Together, this partnership between Wadsworth and NYU will provide researchers with access to state-of-the-art, specialized analytical facilities to support children's environmental health studies. The Wadsworth Center's is fully accredited under CLIA-88, and can support multiple NIH-funded studies, where children's urine and/or serum will be analyzed for organic chemical contaminants including, but not limited to, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, fluorinated compounds, brominated flame retardants, organophosphate insecticides, phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals, and phthalates using techniques based on mass spectrometry. The laboratories are also able to analyze children's biospecimens for exposure to toxic heavy metals including, but not limited to, Pb, Cd, Hg, and As using the most sensitive methods available based on inorganic mass spectrometry. The laboratories are also able to analyze children's blood, serum/plasma, and urine for endogenous compounds including hormones, vitamins, protein markers, electrolytes and metabolite panels (including but not limited to estrogens, androgens, testosterone, thyroid panels, triglycerides, cholesterol, vitamin D and B12, folate, homocysteine and insulin) that may be affected by environmental exposures. Wadsworth provides extensive capabilities for analyzing non-traditional matrices such as placenta, cord blood, baby teeth, dried blood spots, hair, nails, and saliva for organic and inorganic contaminants to support novel approaches to measure children's exposure to toxic chemicals in their environment. Capability and expertise for investigating untargeted compounds will be shared between Wadsworth and NYU, where their extensive capabilities complement each other. The WC-CHEAR will benefit from the Wadsworth Center's international reputation and leadership in the field of clinical laboratory medicine, and as an organizer of proficiency testing (PT) programs in environmental laboratory medicine, clinical chemistry and toxicology. The experience and capability that Wadsworth brings in this regard will provide the NIEHS Children's Health Environmental Analytical Resource (CHEAR) network with a PT program customized to support biomonitoring studies and the needs of the network. The CHEAR PT program developed at Wadsworth will produce well-characterized, matrix-based reference materials containing exogenous and endogenous analytes of interest at critical concentration ranges relevant to biomonitoring that will be shared across the CHEAR lab network."
"9345284","Toxins, pharmaceuticals and physiologically indogenous compounds are metabolized by the liver via several classes of enzymes. The uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are concentrated in the liver but also present in other tissues. These enzymes add UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a compound, thereby increasing its solubility and ability to be excreted in the bile and urine. Oxford Biomedical Research has created a proprietary method for processing a strain of Pichia pastoris optimized for expressing the cytochromes P450 (CYP) and oxidoreductase, resulting in a growing product line tailored to pharmaceutical research. This process transforms the yeast into a stabilized dry powder (SDP) format, which exhibits remarkable organic solvent and thermal tolerance along with extended catalysis when compared to traditional recombinant enzymes. The proposed multi-catalytic platform, capable of simultaneous P450 oxidation followed by UGT glucuronidation, would give the pharmaceutical researcher a valuable tool for preparing glucuronides as well as studying the P450/UGT synergistic relationship. This Phase I proposal will involve producing and optimizing three catalytic systems:the first Pichia system will express the dehydrogenase responsible for converting UDP-glucose to UDPGA, the cofactor required for glucuronide production. The second system will include expand on this platform and include the UGT2B7 enzyme to create a catalyst capable of glucuronidating 4-methylumbelliferone. The third and final system will add into this expression system the CYP3A4 and P450 oxidoreductase (POR) enzymes, with development focusing on the optimization of 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide production. Achieving these goals will give pharmaceutical research a robust, easy-to-use system for performing two metabolically-important reactions in one system; P450 oxidation followed by UGT glucuronidation."

"9446522","ABSTRACT  It has become an increasingly important public health issue to meet the needs of children with autism and other autism-spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are complex developmental disorders characterized by repetitive behavior and delayed social interaction and communication. Studies have indicated that the prevalence of ASDs among children has more than doubled during the past decade. Recent studies have also found substantial unmet mental health (MH) care needs among children with ASDs. While multiple factors contribute to the unmet needs, one important contributing factor is likely an insufficient child MH workforce, especially a ?critical shortage? of child psychiatrists. Yet no work has been done to understand whether MH care is more accessible and patient experience and satisfaction are better for children with autism in areas with higher supply of child MH workforce than in those areas with lower supply.  To fill the gap, this study is designed to provide timely empirical evidence of the consequences of child MH workforce supply on MH care for children with autism. Our specific aims are:  Aim 1. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and access to, utilization of, and experience and satisfaction with mental health care for children with autism.  Aim 2. Examine the relationship between the child MH workforce supply, by discipline, and family burden of children with autism.  Aim 3. Examine whether the effects of child mental health workforce supply on mental health care access, satisfaction, and family burden differ by race and ethnicity or between rural and urban residence.  The proposed project is innovative because (1) unlike previous studies, we will examine the supply of multiple disciplines simultaneously, and (2) our structural, econometric model of physician entry and market structure is explicitly causal, thus providing an answer to the most common objections to the methods typically used in the previous studies of association between physician supply and geographic variations in health care.  The proposed research is highly significant for multiple reasons. First, without an adequate supply of MH providers, the current efforts to strengthen the public health impact of NIMH supported dissemination of research-tested interventions would not be able to achieve optimal effects. Second, some experts have called for more empirical studies of the challenging issue of insufficient and maldistributed supply of child MH workforce. This proposed study responds to the call, and it will generate empirical evidence that will provide policymakers critical information as they address this challenging issue. To our knowledge, the proposed project will be the first to assess how MH workforce supply affects mental health care access, satisfaction and family burden for children with autism. It will also be the first study to examine whether MH workforce supply ameliorates or exacerbates existing disparities in MH health care among this group of children."
"9449734","PROJECT SUMMARY The survival rate of colorectal cancer and breast cancer as measured by Mortality to incidence ratios (MIRs) is worse among American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) population as compared to the white population. AI/AN individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage disease and this leads to poor treatment outcomes and increased mortality. These disparities in cancer within the AI/AN population is compounded by resistance to existing therapies and a high relapse rates among patients. Thus, there is a need to develop novel therapies to cure treatment resistant breast cancer. This study aims to alleviate these disparities faced by the AI/AN population by testing out a new cellular therapeutic approach to treat cancer. NK cells are a key component of the innate immune system and play an important role in early immunity to cancer by killing a variety of tumors. Adoptive transfer of NK cells and NK cell lines is a significant mode of cellular therapy that is being tested in various clinical trials to treat cancers. Efforts are being made to enhance the cytotoxic effects of NK cells and NK cell lines by treating them ex-vivo with different modulating agents. In our recent study, we found that NK cells when treated with reovirus become activated and show an enhanced cytotoxicity against tumor cells. In this project, we will test the ability of reovirus to increase the cytotoxicity of a NK cell line, NK-92MI, against human colorectal cancer cell line-DLD-1. Subsequently, we will perform an adoptive transfer of the reovirus activated NK-92MI cells to treat mice bearing DLD-1 tumors. Results from this study will increase our understanding of NK cell mediated antitumor response and help us develop new strategies to enhance NK cell cytotoxic functions for cancer treatment. Successful completion of this study will provide us with a novel cellular anti-cancer therapy with a potential to be translated into the clinic."
"9406411","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT PROJECT I: LEARNING DIFFICULTIES IN READING, WRITING, AND MATHEMATICS AND THEIR  CO-OCCURRENCE WITH ADHD: ETIOLOGY, NEUROPSYCHOLOGY, AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES The overall goal of Project I is to examine the relations among all dimensions of learning disabilities and ADHD at the phenotypic, etiological, and developmental levels of analysis and to begin to test these relations in historically understudied and underserved populations. The first primary objective of Project I is to conduct an etiologically-informative study of all aspects of learning disabilities in reading (RD), math (MD), and writing (WD), along with the etiology of covariance among these dimensions of academic difficulties and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the related but distinct dimension of attentional functioning called sluggish cognitive tempo. Tests of basic and higher-order dimensions of reading (word reading, reading fluency, and reading comprehension), math (math calculations, math fluency, and math reasoning), and writing (handwriting, spelling, grammar, and written content) will be administered to a sample of 250 twin pairs between 8 and 12 years of age in which at least one twin has a school history of learning and/or attentional difficulties, along with a comparison sample of 100 twin pairs without learning or attentional difficulties. These data will then be combined with twin pairs tested during the current and previous funding period of the CLDRC to provide sufficient statistical power to test competing models of the phenotypic and etiological structure of all aspects of learning disabilities (LDs). Results of these models will provide a foundation for synergistic collaborative analyses that examine the relations between the latent measures of learning difficulties that are identified and measures of processing speed and executive functions (Project I and II), structural and functional neuroimaging phenotypes (Project III), and molecular genetic risk factors (Project IV). In addition, Project I will conduct include two longitudinal followup studies. In the first study approximately 180 pairs of twins from the CLDRC and an independent sample of 100 bilingual (English and Spanish) Hispanic adolescents with and without RD will complete a streamlined version of the Project I and Project II test batteries approximately five years after they were first tested. The second longitudinal study will administer an online battery of outcome measures to over 1,200 pairs of young adult twins who previously participated in the CLDRC or one of our ongoing longitudinal twin studies of unselected samples in Colorado or Ohio, providing a cost-effective assessment of important longer-term developmental outcomes of LDs."
"9464101","Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become a worldwide epidemic with significant human and economic burdens. Diabetic patients are particularly at risk of mortality from myocardial infarction and it is therefore important that glucose lowering is achieved by drugs that do not further compromise the heart. Evidence now supports Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a mediator Ca2+ signaling in liver and heart, as a novel target for inhibitors with the unique dual action of lowering glucose while providing cardioprotection. Genetic approaches have rigorously demonstrated that a CaMKII-p38a-MK2/3 pathway mediates the action of glucagon on glucose production in liver while a CaMKII-Ryanodine receptor pathway underlies dysregulated Ca2+ signaling in heart. Genetic suppression of CaMKII lowers blood glucose, and decreases progression from hypertrophy to heart failure and arrhythmia, while its hyperactivity increases blood glucose and promotes heart disease.  We propose to advance our highly selective allosteric small molecule CaMKII inhibitors via lead optimization and test the feasibility that they lower hepatic glucose production. Activated CaMKII is prone to pathological hyperactive states in diabetes, due to oxidation and other post-translational modifications, all of which are blocked by our allosteric inhibitors. We propose a structure-based medicinal chemistry strategy of lead optimization to increase inhibitor potency and limit any CNS penetration while retaining their high kinase selectivity. We will evaluate their biochemical and cellular properties to ensure they have the desired characteristics prior to a mechanistic POC in lowering hepatic glucose output in ob/ob mice. Successful completion of our Phase I milestones will set a clear path for a Phase II proposal to further advance its pharmacokinetics and other drug-like properties and extend the proof-of-concept for cardioprotection and long-term glucose control. Pharma and venture capitalists have shown significant interest in our allosteric CaMKII inhibitor program?their funding is dependent on achieving a more advanced lead compound that does not affect brain CaMKII while showing preclinical efficacy in glucose control. Our proposed studies and an SBIR award will position the program for funding or a partnership to advance through IND enabling studies and an IND."
"9484392","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vast majority of current therapeutic agents function by binding to disease-associated macromolecules and modulating their activity. Recent developments, however, have made increasingly realistic the possibility of developing next-generation therapeutics that do not simply bind targets implicated in disease, but instead alter the covalent structure of genes and gene products in ways that can more effectively treat-or even cure-many diseases. While the possibility of precisely manipulating genes and proteins in mammalian cells and, eventually, in humans, has enormous potential, several major challenges must be overcome to fully realize this vision. Perhaps the most significant of these challenges is the efficient creation of the macromolecules that are needed to alter genomes or proteomes with a high degree of selectivity and potency. To realize a vision in which arbitrary genes or proteins can be manipulated in mammalian cells to treat disease thus requires new approaches to rapidly generating macromolecules with precise, tailor-made properties.  During the last granting period, we developed a system that enables proteins to evolve continuously in the laboratory, requiring virtually no researcher intervention. The resulting system, phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), allows proteins to undergo directed evolution at a rate ~100-fold faster than conventional methods. In the first applications of PACE, we rapidly evolved RNA polymerases with dramatically different DNA promoter specificities. We also identified the vulnerabilities of drug candidates to the evolution of drug resistance by using PACE to evolve proteases that are resistant to HCV protease inhibitors currently used in human clinical trials. In addition, we developed important PACE capabilities beyond basic positive selection, including small- molecule modulation of selection stringency and negative selection against undesired activities. These initial studies established PACE as a robust and general platform to evolve proteins with tailor-made properties at an unprecedented speed.  In the next granting period, we propose to apply these developments to continuously evolve four classes of proteins or RNAs, each with the ability to manipulate the covalent structure of genes or gene products, and each with potential relevance to the development of next-generation human therapeutics: recombinase enzymes that insert DNA of interest into safe-harbor loci in the human genome, proteases that specifically cleave disease- associated proteins, orthogonal Cas9 (CRISPR) nucleases with altered PAM specificities and enhanced activities, and smart Cas9 guide RNAs that mediate genome engineering only in those cells that are in specific disease-associated cell states. Success would establish the novel therapeutic potential of these proteins and RNAs to address a wide range of human diseases, including many human genetic disorders."
"9567754","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Twenty-first century biomedical science is a multidisciplinary, data-intensive global enterprise that depends critically on clear specification of research methods and results. The reproducibility of findings that is fundamental to good science and the meta-analysis of pooled data from disparate sources are both catalyzed by standardized approaches to acquiring and representing data. In this context, the PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) Toolkit is an increasingly valuable catalog of standard measures and associated bioinformatics tools that help investigators to improve the quality and consistency of their data collection and identify opportunities for collaborative research. Launched in 2009, PhenX Toolkit measures are being incorporated in several major studies and consortiums. The proposed 5- year research plan ?Genomic Resource Grant for PhenX Toolkit ? expansion and sustainability? expands the Toolkit?s scope and includes an updated interface and new ontology-based tools. The PhenX multidisciplinary team of researchers and developers, together with input from the scientific community, will increase the utility and impact of the PhenX Toolkit through the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Expand PhenX Toolkit research domains. Address the evolving needs of Toolkit users and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by adding PhenX measures related to cancer, environmental exposures, pediatrics, and mental health. Specific Aim 2: Maintain and extend existing collaborations. Accelerate efforts with external collaborators and facilitate navigation between the Toolkit and complementary resources such as the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Common Data Element (CDE) Resource and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). Specific Aim 3: Raise awareness and increase impact. We propose a multifaceted educational component to raise awareness and increase use of PhenX measures and tools. Specific Aim 4: Link PhenX measures to established ontologies. The extended PhenX ontology (based on existing ontologies) will be implemented in a cloud computing environment in a way that will enable nimble navigation and the development of tools for users to link and harmonize variables across studies. Specific Aim 5: Provide new tools that investigators need. Develop a nimble and enriched interface that can traverse the increasing complexity of the Toolkit, support access by mobile devices, and leverage the PhenX ontology to develop novel tools for comparing measures and variables. Specific Aim 6: Project management and co- funded research. Enable effective communications and project management with a strong organization, assuring responsiveness, flexibility, and coordination of co-funding efforts. Through these aims, the PhenX Toolkit will support evolving research needs, help increase the impact of individual studies, facilitate translational research, and revolutionize data sharing and harmonization."
"9378040","Abstract  Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in American men, second only to lung cancer. Primary and advanced prostate cancers respond to androgen ablation therapy initially, which is followed by progression to castration resistance within a short frame of time for many patients. Recently a second-generation anti-androgen, enzalutamide has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of chemotherapy-nave as well as post-chemotherapy prostate cancers. But innate and acquired resistance to enzalutamide treatment has been observed in the clinic and the mechanisms are still being studied. Use of PSA as a biomarker does not predict the possible outcome of patients with respect to development of resistance. Identification of biomarkers which facilitate risk assessment and predict which patients will respond to treatment would better inform treatment choices and improve patient care. MicroRNAs may serve as ideal non-invasive biomarkers due to their specificity and proportionality to disease development. MicroRNAs can be analyzed in biofluids such as blood, sera, urine, plasma etc., and in exosomes isolated from these biofluids. Our preliminary data show that miR-Let-7c is downregulated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer, while its master regulator, Lin28 is upregulated. We also show that both Let-7c and Lin28 can be reliably measured in exosomes derived from human prostate cancer cells. Hence, we hypothesize that the alteration of the Let- 7c:Lin28 ratio in tumor-derived exosomes may serve as a potential predictor of therapy-resistance in prostate cancer.  In aim 1, we will validate preliminary data in a systematic study involving the measurement of expression levels of Let-7c and Lin28 in prostate cancer samples and tumor-derived exosomes from the UC Davis Cancer Center Biorepository and the Prostate Cancer Biorepository Network (PCBN) using quantitative real-time PCR. In aim 2, we will develop bioassays to assess the Let-7c:Lin28 status in tumor-derived exosomes from xenografts of human prostate cancer cells. These bioassays will be validated in a limited cohort human study using blood samples from patients with enzalutamide-treated prostate cancer. Blood samples will be collected at 4 time points during the treatment of patients with enzalutamide and prostate- derived exosomes will be isolated. The ability of the ratio of Let-7c:Lin28 to predict the development of resistance to enzalutamide will be evaluated following the measurement of Let-7c and Lin28 levels in exosomes using quantitative real-time PCR. These studies will provide a rationale for the assessment of the ability of the ratio of Let-7c:Lin28 to predict whether they will respond to enzalutamide in a larger cohort of patients."
"9378743","Project Summary/Abstract Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is an invasive procedure evaluating the functional significance of an intermediate stenosis by measurement of pressure differences across that particular stenosis. Noninvasive techniques such as CT-FFR, using computational fluid dynamic methods with computed tomography (CT) images to calculate the FFR index, have shown to reduce the number of patients requiring invasive procedures. However, the use of ionizing radiation in CT prevents longitudinal monitoring of patients who were deferred from invasive tests and treatment. To address the problem, we propose a noninvasive pressure measurement technique in the coronary arteries using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has no ionizing radiation. The method is based on velocity measured from phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) in conjunction with navier-stokes equations to derive pressure differences, which has been studied in various vessels such as the aorta, carotid, renal and intracranial arteries. To apply the technique in the coronary arteries, challenges such as cardiac and respiratory motion and high spatial and temporal resolution for PC-MRI acquisitions need to be addressed. In this study, we aim to address the challenges by using 1) ECG and Navigator-gating to minimize motion errors and 2) 2D interleaved multi-slice radial acquisition using a golden-angle sampling scheme to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. The hypothesis is that the proposed PC-MRI technique could further improve the navier- stokes analysis and thus, the derived pressure difference index. The measured velocity values from proposed PC-MRI and derived pressure difference index will be compared to invasive flow and pressure to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method and its correlation to clinical gold standard. This noninvasive technique could potentially obtain both the anatomical and functional information in one imaging session without added risks, patient discomfort and high surgical costs from invasive procedures or ionizing radiation from CT-FFR."
"9467380","Project Summary/Abstract Much work has been performed to study reactive electron orbitals in nonheme enzymes (NHE) and their activation of oxygen. Similar to NHEs, heme-containing enzymes play a diverse set of roles in the biosphere and factor heavily to human health: detoxification, oxygen transport, and hormone synthesis. It is important that heme enzymes be understood to a similar extent as NHEs, however the tools used to characterize NHE electron covalency of Fe, such as magnetic circular dichroism optical spectroscopy, are not as applicable to hemes due to the highly delocalized equatorial porphyrin ring that obscures the covalency of the Fe atom. The covalency of the low-lying valence orbitals of the heme site, actively tunes intermediates for their function in biology. To directly probe the Fe center in heme enzymes, this project will use the relatively new resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy. 1s2p RIXS uses K-edge, hard X-ray, incident photons and detects the subsequent 2p to 1s hole-filling resulting in the same final state as L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) ? with different selection rules. RIXS yields information about the electronic structure of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), specifically d orbital covalency, critical to studying oxygen activation by hemes, however without the weaknesses inherent in soft X-ray L-edge XAS such as high vacuum requirements, high sample concentrations, and fluorescence inhibition. However, a new ultra-low noise detector called the TES will finally allow Fe L-edge XAS spectra of dilute enzyme samples, and correlating 1s2p RIXS with L-edge XAS will afford the differential orbital covalency of the frontier molecular orbitals that are key to reactivity. Initially, the trainee will apply RIXS and L- edge XAS to nonheme and heme model complexes, particularly the well-understood nonheme models will allow development of the experimentally observed 4p orbital mixing into the simulation of RIXS spectra. The trainee will then explore the change of the Fe=O bond when going from a nonheme to a heme environment in an enzyme. With L-edge XAS and RIXS the reactive orbitals of cytochrome p450 compound II will reveal the driving forces for the ?rebound mechanism? of hydroxylation. Next, this study will explore the change in the Fe=O bond upon conversion to the compound I radical cation intermediate and the implications for H-atom abstraction. Finally, the frontier molecular orbitals of compound I will be compared across the different trans axial ligations in heme enzymes. This interchange of the axial ligand (histidine, cysteine, and tyrosine) will quantitively identify the, currently, loosely defined ?push? and ?pull? effects on the heme electronic structure that allow heterolytic O2 cleavage. This project will further the fundamental knowledge of Fe oxygen chemistry in heme, and nonheme, enzymes. Providing new insights into the nature and reactivity of the Fe=O bond, the role that the porphyrin plays in hemes, and how that is adapted in NHEs where no such electron sink is available. This work will also develop the methods and modelling of 1s2p RIXS and TES detected L-edge XAS on bioinorganic systems."
"9436843","Project Summary  Childhood trauma occurs at an unacceptably high rate. In the most recent National Survey of Children's Health, almost half of the children experienced at least one or more types of serious childhood trauma- nearly 35 million children. Childhood trauma has dramatic and costly effects in adulthood. Childhood trauma increases the risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety, panic reaction, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), somatoform disorders, substance abuse and psychotic disorders. Childhood trauma significantly alters treatment trajectories and outcome for the worse. It is our contention that the ratio of basic research effort to clinical impact is too low. The purpose of this application is accelerate the development of a novel trauma model we believe delivers robust and relevant outcomes and to explore a novel hypothesis concerning the etiology of increased mental illness liability.  We will pursue our studies in two research aims. Aim 1 is designed to further develop a novel live-predator model (snake) with the proposition that a highly salient, ethologically-relevant trauma will engage the nervous system in a manner relevant to studies of psychiatric disorders. We will systematically manipulate timing and number of adolescent trauma exposures and conduct large-scale mining in adulthood for physiological, behavioral and neurobiological profiles indicative of behavioral constructs that cross diagnostic boundaries (e.g. hyper arousal, anhedonia, depression and anxiety). Neural activation patterns will be assessed in key RMTg-centric circuitry via cFos activation patterns. A wealth of within subjects behavioral and neurobiological data will be subject to multidimensional scaling and categorical analysis to identify patterns of circuitry involvement associated with specific abnormal behavioral profiles. Aim 2 will test the novel hypothesis that adolescent exposure to ethologically-relevant trauma results in enduring behavioral and neurobiological disruptions that require rostral medial tegmentum (RMTg) function. The combination of roles hypothesized to involve the RMTg (threat, fear, avoidance and negative affect) place it in an ideal situation to mediate disruptive consequences of early trauma and some of the core symptoms found to cross diagnostic domains. We will systematically inhibit (RMTg-directed muscimol) or potentiate (RMTg-directed AMPA) RMTg function during trauma exposure to test our hypothesis. A similar analysis as described in Aim 1 will determine if RMTg inhibition or potentiation dampens or worsens, respectively, behavioral and neurobiological outcomes.  Childhood trauma and the subsequent development of mood disorders is emerging as a pervasive theme in mental illness. Preclinical research is uniquely qualified to systematically investigate the consequences of early-life trauma. Improving animal models and our neurobiological understanding of the symptom domains impacted by trauma could significantly improve treatment strategies to help alleviate the individual and societal burden."
"9418923","Abstract - CREP The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research and Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT-CHD), a partnership between Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) and Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC), presents a unique opportunity for joint efforts to advance biospecimen-based research in cancer health disparities. There is an unmet need for cancer researchers who are culturally competent with unique expertise to conduct health disparities research. The Cancer Research Education Program is an integral component of the SPIRIT-CHD and is designed to meet this need. The CREP will be a joint, collaborative, innovative program with three primary aims: Research Experiences, Curriculum, and Outreach. 1. (Research Experiences): to provide undergraduate and medical students with hands on summer research experiences that address biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. We will build upon and expand an infrastructure between the LSUHSC and MCC for biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities research training for undergraduate and medical students with emphasis on underrepresented minority (URM) students. Over the funding period, we expect to train a total of 44 trainees. 2. (Curriculum): to provide students with formal training in cancer research, focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. All students (LSUHSC and MCC) will share the same overall curriculum: a) a series of web-based modules, b) experiences in cancer health disparities research, biobanking, precision medicine and biomedical ethics, and c) didactic learning activities. 3. (Outreach): to expand existing community-based participatory research (CBPR) by engaging summer interns in outreach education activities to minority communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. Specifically, this infrastructure will provide students with opportunity for immersion experiences and for skill development in communicating about biobanking, precision medicine, and cancer health disparities research to lay audiences. We have incorporated formative (process) and summative (impact/outcome) evaluation metrics into each of the activities associated with the three aims. These processes will help to monitor and gauge success as well as pinpoint areas for improvement and refinement. The CREP will help to create the next generation of clinical and research scientists who are prepared to address the challenges of cancer health disparities research in relation to precision medicine and participation in biobanking. We also expect this educational program to generate preliminary data that will lead to competitive grant applications for extramural peer-reviewed funding by NIH/NCI (e.g., R25e)."
"9255803","Project Summary/Abstract While much has been accomplished in managing hyperglycemia, morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often results from cardiovascular complications. Evidence suggests peripheral artery disease and skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction. One reason is the lack of reliable tools to characterize skeletal muscle microcirculation and mitochondrial capacity ? key elements in regulating effective mobility and insulin use in health and disease. Our central hypothesis is that near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based technology can uniquely assess skeletal muscle function in patients with T1D because it accounts for macrovascular, microvascular, and pharmacologic influences on muscle function. In addition, the attributes of this technology are inherently valuable to the study and care of complications of type 1 diabetes patients because it is safe, reliable, non-invasive and scalable for widespread use. To that end, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: we will develop an automated analysis platform for NIRS-derived measures of skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity. Specific Aim 2: we will define the value proposition of NIRS-based microvascular and mitochondrial assessment. Analysis platform validation will include test-retest NIRS measurements and comparison measurement of microcirculation and mitochondrial using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Patients with type 1 diabetes (n=16) and aged-matched healthy subjects (n=4) will be evaluated. Our value proposition will be defined through customer discovery with internists, endocrinologists, and cardiologists. The endpoint for the second aim will be a detailed testing protocol and fully automated web-based analysis program, including error analysis and error correction recommendations. We will provide beta-testing access to the automated analysis product. End-user data will inform the next phase of product development ? a fully integrated and automated data acquisition and analysis platform. Importantly, Infrared Rx, Inc. will engage the expertise of team- members with healthcare software and marketing expertise to drive the customer discovery process. The NIRS based technology is noninvasive, inexpensive and portable. By making the methods simple to perform and obtain results; NIRS has the potential to be a clinical evaluation tool for patients with Type 1 Diabetes."
"9432408","PROJECT ABSTRACT Anorexia nervosa (AN) is among the most pernicious of psychiatric disorders, demonstrating elevated rates of mortality, and a chronic and relapsing illness course that is refractory to current treatment approaches. Further, the etiology of AN remain elusive. While more efficacious treatments are urgently needed, the development of precision treatments is dependent upon the identification of mechanistic pathways that underpin symptom presentations. This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will provide targeted training and mentorship for Dr. Stuart Murray to embark upon a career of independent research oriented towards the delineation of key mechanistic pathways underpinning AN symptomatology. This, in turn, will allow subsequent treatment development efforts to be targeted towards precise pathogenic mechanisms to alter the pathway by which they drive AN symptomatology. The projects outlined in this proposal relate specifically to fear conditioning and fear extinction, given (i) the centrality of fear in presentations of AN, (ii) the substantial overlap between AN and disorders characterized by perturbations in fear conditioning, and (iii) and the absence of empirical evidence relating to fear acquisition and fear extinction in AN. With a team of expert mentors and consultants that collectively bridge the fields of AN, translational psychiatry, neuroimaging, fear extinction, and biostatistics, Dr. Murray aims to (i) index psychological and physiological markers of fear acquisition and fear extinction during a fear conditioning paradigm utilizing both neutral cues, and disorder-specific cues, and (ii) map the neural biomarkers of both fear acquisition and fear extinction via neuroimaging. It is expected that the results of this study will contribute significantly to the development of precision targets for AN treatments, and the training encapsulated herein will position Dr. Murray as an independent researcher in the field of precision treatment for AN."
"9376467","The gut microbiota is closely linked with many gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), diabetes, and colorectal cancer. However, many of the molecular mechanisms by which gut microorganisms and their metabolic products perturb host immunity are not yet understood. Both live cell and microbially-derived small molecule interventions have proven to prevent or ameliorate GI inflammation, but to a large degree, the therapeutic potential of targeted components of the microbiome has not yet been realized. In response to RFA-DK-15-012, we thus propose a ?community research resource of identified members of the microbiome and factors they elaborate which modulate human physiology or pathophysiology related to... digestive diseases.? The Human Microbial Bioactives Resource (HMBR) will provide a comprehensive platform for discovery, validation, and early-stage translation of novel therapeutics derived from the microbiome: 1. An efficient end-to-end sampling and multi?omic profiling system for the host and microbiota in  gastrointestinal disease. 2. Data from thousands of IBD microbiomes and tens of thousands of gut microbiome profiles, spanning  dozens of datasets and meta-analyzing multiple countries, cohorts, and clinical centers. 3. Prioritized potentially bioactive elements of the gut microbiome in IBD, including A) microbial species  and strains, B) microbial gene products (proteins, secreted peptides, biosynthetic gene clusters, etc.),  and C) small molecules (e.g. metabolites or signaling molecules). 4. Screens for high-priority bioactives in vitro using mammalian cell and tissue models to characterize  potential mechanisms of action and identify host-microbe-metabolite interactions. 5. Phenotypic readouts (cell population, cellular function-based, and preclinical IBD models) for successful  bioactives in conventional and gnotobiotic mice to assess activity in vivo. 6. All HMBR data, protocols, computational tools, microbial isolates, compounds, cell lines, mice,  screening results, and training material provided to the community through a unified web-based portal. 7. Exercising the resource with a driving biological application by verifying and characterizing novel  modulators of the IL-10 anti-inflammatory and TNF? pro-inflammatory responses. This resource will be developed in the context of the Broad Institute, a leader in gut microbiome profiling and analysis in IBD; the Harvard School of Public Health, home to a rigorously monitored gnotobiotic mouse facility; and the University of Maryland, which currently supports the largest human microbiome resource worldwide in the form of the Human Microbiome Project 1 and 2 Data Coordinating Centers. Through this combination of investigators, environments, resources, and biological applications, we will establish and provide to the community the first platform of its kind for end-to-end microbiome therapeutic discovery and validation."
"9545165","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has complex and varying etiologies. A lack of understanding regarding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms is a key barrier in finding effective treatments. Single-gene disorders that have a high prevalence of ASD provide unique opportunities to investigate the underlying biology and test treatments for autism. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder in which approximately 50% of individuals are also affected with ASD. Importantly, TSC can be diagnosed before or at the time of birth, and thus infants with TSC allow us to observe prospectively the natural history of ASD and develop better tools for early detection of autism. On a molecular level, TSC disease manifestations result from the aberrant hyperactivity of mTOR that is caused by mutation in one of two TSC genes. Pharmacologic mTOR inhibition to correct the cellular defects in TSC is no longer a hope for the future, but rather an exciting reality with proven efficacy against various TSC disease manifestations. To determine the potential benefit these agents may have in treating or preventing ASD, it is imperative to identify early markers of autism in infants with TSC, so as to not put young children who will not develop ASD at unnecessary risk. Accumulating clinical and basic science evidence suggests that aberrant white matter connectivity represents a rational candidate as a biomarker in TSC. TSC mouse models demonstrate defects in the specification, guidance, and myelination of axons. More importantly, several groups have reported abnormalities in the normal-appearing white matter of TSC patients that can be identified by MR imaging, and loss of white matter microstructural integrity is associated with neurological and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, there is preliminary data indicating that white matter integrity can be improved by treatment with mTOR inhibitors in both animal models and in TSC patients. Taken together, these findings lead to the hypothesis that longitudinal assessment of white matter integrity and neural connectivity in TSC infants, through advanced MRI and EEG analysis, can be used as an early biomarker of subsequent ASD in this genetic disease. This proposal aims to establish a consortium of five Children's Hospitals that are geographically-distributed throughout the US to recruit TSC patients in the first year of life to test this hypothesis. State of the art imaging with 3Tesla MR scanners, advanced EEG technology, validated neurodevelopmental assessment tools, genetic analysis, and standardized clinical measures through age 36 months will be utilized. The clinical consortium will be supported by a centralized Data Coordinating Center with experience in another rare disease (neurofibro- matosis). Collaboration with Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND) programs at each center will provide additional interdisciplinary research training and education expertise in ASD and TSC. As a result of the research outlined in this proposal, better understanding of brain connectivity and it relationship to ASD in TSC will pave the way for new interventions for this and related causes of autism."

"9545258","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metabolism represents the organic and chemical processes within a cell that are necessary to maintain life. It is also the way that a cell interacs with energy sources, coordinating energy intake, storage, and utilization, ultimately allowing proper cellular growth and function. A key molecule in metabolism is Acetyl-CoA, a molecule sitting at the crossroads of multiple metabolic pathways, while also serving as a substrate for histone acetylation, one of the main epigenetic marks in the genome. Recent studies have demonstrated that fluctuations in availability of Acetyl-CoA can directly impinge on levels of histone acetylation, yet whether the reverse is possible remains unknown. In other words, may acetate from histone marks serve as a reservoir to modulate Acetyl- CoA levels in order to sustain metabolic homeostasis? And if so, can changes in the epigenome affect metabolism due to a direct effect on acetate availability? In this context, environmental stresses such as ionizing radiation (IR) or hypoxia may directly affect the epigenome, in turn affecting its potentil to buffer Acetyl-CoA levels. This hypothesis represents the main focus of this R21/R33 proposal. Specifically, in the first exploratory (R21) phase the intent is to: 1- Develop a pulse-chase assay using stable-isotope tracing to follow crosstalk between the nucleus and the mitochondria; and 2- Determine the role of the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT6 in mobilizing acetate from chromatin under conditions of environmental stress. These experiments should set the basis to develop the second R33 phase, where the focus is to: 3- Analyze the role of environmental and nutrient stress in modulating this epigenetics-metabolism crosstalk and 4- Determine the in vivo significance for the nucleus as an energy reservoir. All together, these experiments should provide direct evidence for a role of the nucleus as a metabolic reservoir, which may point to strategies where modulation of epigenetic marks may serve as a strategy against metabolic diseases and environmental stresses."
"9376267","ABSTRACT Each year, more than one million patients are hospitalized in the U.S. for significant skin loss due to thermal and pressure injuries, chronic diabetic ulcers or genetic skin diseases. The ability to generate engineered human skin equivalents (HSEs) has provided a promising and effective therapy for these patients. However, currently available HSEs still have various limitations including poor viability and lack of appendages or mismatch in hair density. Skin is a complex organ, which contains more than 50 different cell types and various components such as vasculature, hair follicles, sensory neurons, and immune cells. The field of skin tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is currently limited by the lack of skin models that recapitulate the anatomy and physiology of human skin. This research will advance the generation of high-fidelity engineered skin grafts with functional appendages to be used in skin replacement therapy as well as modeling skin disorders in 3D. Our recent work has improved the viability of skin grafts by establishing a method to micropattern vasculature in HSEs, however, it still remains a prevailing challenge to incorporate hair follicles into engineered skin grafts in order to improve wound healing and skin function. The goal of this project is to engineer viable and functional skin equivalents with hair follicles and vasculature, using exclusively cultured human cells, for future use in drug screening and clinical applications. These studies will address several prevailing challenges in the field of skin/hair tissue engineering by achieving: i) efficient hair induction using cultured human DPC; ii), initiation of hair morphogenesis in 3D human skin equivalents in vitro, iii) control over region-specific hair density, iv) viable skin grafts through promoting adequate vascularization, and v) combination of a vasculature network with hair follicles to build increase the complexity of existing 3D skin models. This project is highly responsive to several of the areas of interest in this RFA-AR-17-005 including: 1) Sophisticated skin models that incorporate multiple skin components such as hair follicles, vasculature, nerves, sweat glands, immune cells, and fat; 2) Add complexity to existing model systems; and 3) Engineering functional stem cell niches in 3-D musculoskeletal and skin models. We will employ bioengineering, genetics, pharmacological and systems biology approaches to address this hypothesis, allowing for the development of truly functional and viable skin substitutes for patients with significant skin/hair loss, and providing 3D in vitro screening models of skin and hair follicles for pharmaceutical development applications."

The NewsHour aims to engage with the public on issues that are on their minds but then take the reporting to the next level, so that people understand not only what is at stake for them personally, but how what is happening in labs and universities translates into new advances and developments. Social media will be used both to engage with the public and to promote this content. Through this funding and using these stories produced by the award winning PBS NewsHour medical reporting team as a focus, the PBS NewsHour's Student Reporting Labs will experiment with an adaptation of its successful science program to work with eight Labs to produce unique news stories that view health science topics from a youth perspective. These videos will become part of a comprehensive set of lesson plans and learning tools disseminated online to the general public, educators and youth media organizations to draw attention to American health and biomedical issues and careers. Students will be supported with curricula and mentorship on fundamental research practice and the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible journalism. This process will ensure the next generation includes citizens who are effective health science communicators and self-motivated learners with a deep connection to the role of biomedical research in their careers and future life. Youth program resources will be posted on the PBS NewsHour Extra site to serve its 700,000 annual users and our partner sites PBS Learning Media and Share My Lesson - the two biggest free education resource sites on the web."
"9466171","The binding sites of proteins include smaller regions called hot spots that are major contributors to the binding free energy, and hence are crucial to binding any ligand at that site. Hot spots can be determined by screening libraries of fragment-sized organic molecules for binding to the target protein by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The computational mapping algorithm FTMap, developed at Boston University and a related program, Atlas, by Acpharis are faster analogs of experimental screening techniques. Application of computational mapping to fragment based ligand discovery (FBLD), which is a goal of this proposal, requires comparison of the predicted pose of a ligand fragment and poses of mapping probes in important hot spots of a protein binding site. The procedure involves three preliminary steps: (1) identification of binding hot spots, (2) generation of the accurate poses of molecular probes in the main hot spots, (3) prediction of the binding mode of the ligand fragment. Steps 2 and 3 depend on the accuracy of the energy function used in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) based algorithm of computational mapping. Here we propose development of structure based statistical potentials (SBSPs) focused on the main hot spots as a straightforward way to improve specificity of mapping energy function. SBSPs are constructed as energy values derived from the frequencies of atomic contacts in the databases of known protein-ligand structures. They rely on statistics of interaction and reference states of the system of interacting atoms with assigned atom types. Our approach will use non-specifically binding docking decoys as a reference state (DARS). We will derive the interaction states from the hot spot regions of the binding site. For construction of SBSPs we will select training, reference, and validation sets of protein-ligand structures from the PDBbind database, which collects complexes with known experimental binding affinities. We will rely on the Atlas software of Acpharis for parameterization of the fragments and for docking to generate the decoys. We will define atom types to reflect distinct chemical properties of an atom in its environment. To construct the potentials we will calculate maximum interaction distances for each atom type pair from the radial distribution function of interactions. To test, the new potential?s correlation between the statistical pairwise energy and experimental binding energy will be calculated for the small molecule validation set. We will add a pairwise DARS term, based on statistical potentials into the mapping energy function and reweight energy terms to fit the experimental binding energy. We will evaluate the docking performance of the new energy function on molecules from the validation set. Proposed developments will increase the accuracy of virtual screening by computational mapping for the selection of fragment hits, reducing or even removing the need for experimental screening in fragment based ligand discovery."
"9339553","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been an increasingly common and complicated treatment issue for veteran and non-veteran patients over the past decade. One of the most difficult management issues is that of recurrent CDI. ~20% of patients who are successfully treated with either metronidazole or vancomycin will have a recurrent episode. Those who have already had a recurrent episode have ~50% chance of third diarrheal episode and some patients will have recurrent CDI for months or years. In addition, recurrent CDI has had a major impact on healthcare facilities because of frequent readmission rates to acute care facilities. Several host factors have been implicated as risks for recurrent CDI. However, there has been relatively little attention paid to pathogen or bacterial factors that might influence the risk of recurrence. The increase in rates of CDI and complications such as recurrent CDI over the past decade has coincided with the emergence of the epidemic C. difficile BI/027/NAP1 strain. Several potential virulence factors expressed by this strain have been proposed, but recent evidence suggests that binary toxin (CDT) produced by this strain and other clinically important (e.g., BK/078/NAP7) strains may play a critical adjunctive role in CDI pathogenesis. C. difficile binary toxin (CDT) is unrelated to the large, single unit glycosylating toxins, toxin A and B. This 2-component (binary) toxin acts by ADP-ribosylation of the cytoskeletal protein, actin, resulting in microtubular structural changes and epithelial cell membrane protrusions which increase adherence and colonization of C. difficile. Our research aims are designed to test the hypothesis that binary toxin increases the risk of recurrent CDI by two experimental lines of investigation. First, we will use the hamster model of CDI to demonstrate the effect of binary toxin by using isogenic mutants of C. difficile in which the binary gene toxin is knocked out. Second, we will use a newly developed immunoassay for binary toxin to test patient stool specimens and correlate the presence of fecal binary toxin with clinical recurrence of CDI. The specific aims of this proposal include: 1. Establish a reproducible hamster model of CDI recurrence.  Aim 1a) Construct binary toxin mutants in the epidemic-associated BI and BK strains (CDTneg) for the baseline experiments in the hamster model  Aim 1b) Establish a reproducible recurrence rate in the hamster model using binary toxin mutants (CDTneg) & confirm increased recurrence rates using respective parent (CDTpos) strains 2. Determine the mechanism of increased CDI recurrence due to binary toxin Aim 2a) Determine the mechanism in vitro using a human intestinal epithelial cell line Aim 2b) Determine the mechanism in vivo in hamsters 3. Correlate the expression of binary toxin in patients with CDI recurrence Aim 3a) Correlate fecal binary toxin detection with CDI recurrence Aim 3b) Correlate the presence of binary toxin-positive C. difficile strains with CDI recurrence"
"9422443","Project Summary/Abstract Genetically engineered animal models are essential for understanding how genes can affect cancer susceptibility, development, and progression. For that reason, an animal model core service is essential for a Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). The Genetically Engineered Mouse Facility (GEMF) at MD Anderson Cancer Center was begun in 1988 by Dr. Guillermina Lozano to generate genetically modified animals in an effort to evaluate genes identified as possible tumor suppressors and activators. As many basic and translational research programs at MD Anderson are based on a genetic analyses of cancer, our research faculty must be able to access a strong transgenic facility. The GEMF provides a common source of state-of- the-art expertise and technical skills for Dr. Lozano and other MD Anderson investigators for the generation of their genetically engineered mouse models. Because of the individual nature of each mouse project, the GEMF provides comprehensive animal model services to all institutional investigators, regardless of prior expertise. The GEMF has provided services to more than 150 different Cancer Center members. Mouse models generated by the GEMF have been used in research reported in more than 160 publications. Dr. Jan Parker- Thornburg (this author, the co-Director of the GEMF at MD Anderson) provides essential individualized service including: 1) consultation on optimal animal models for an investigator's specific needs, 2) generation of the agreed-upon model, and 3) training in how to care for and evaluate the models produced. I bring in and test cutting-edge technologies for use by MD Anderson investigators. I am expected to develop new strategies and technologies to meet the needs of our faculty. Exciting new CRISPR/Cas9 technologies are currently being used, assessed, and refined in the GEMF. Work performed for on-site investigators (Richard Behringer, Gigi Lozano) has produced a number of insights into the technology, including describing the mosaic nature of the resulting F0 animals, and establishing new methods to increase the rate of exact targeting (homology-driven repair). Collaborations have been established to develop and test novel ways to generate conditional mutations. New Cas enzymes with different sequence specificity and those providing more faithful activity will be tested. Our results will be widely shared with other transgenic facilities as they are validated. We are highly involved with both developing and with standardizing new technologies for use at MD Anderson and in transgenic facilities worldwide."
"9288871","Project Summary/Abstract The importance of RNA in regulating cellular processes and gene expression has generated tremendous interest in methods to reliably characterize RNAs and their interactions within cells. Currently available solutions utilize expensive synthetic probes and suffer from disrupted RNA structure and poor efficiency, or they require test-tube RNA synthesis and lack the structure and natural assembly that occurs within live cells. RNA-modifying enzymes provide a remarkable opportunity to be harnessed as powerful tools to covalently and selectively modify RNA with affinity probes in complex media. The RNA-TAG (Transglycosylation At Guanosine) methodology, recently developed in our lab, is unique in its use of bacterial tRNA Guanine Transglycosylase (TGT) to directly and selectively transfer a small covalent modification, such as a biotin, to RNA bearing a specific encoded recognition element. TGT shows promise due to the ease of derivatization of its known substrate, preQ1, as well as its substrate selection, which is orthogonal to eukaryotic systems. Building on our initial work, we seek to establish an RNA-centric technology that can facilitate the robust purification and proteomic analysis of RNA-protein complexes by direct labeling of a minimally perturbing recognition element encoded within an RNA of interest. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we will encode the TGT recognition element into the gene for the oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR to facilitate labeling and isolation of the natively expressed lncRNA in complex with its bound proteins. Preliminary experiments using the novel RNA-TAG methodology have established the ability to efficiently biotinylate and pull down expressed mRNA from cellular lysate. Furthermore, we have demonstrated covalent labeling of a minimally modified HOTAIR mutant without the need for introduction of exogenous structural elements. Through the proposed work, we will establish RNA-TAG as a robust RNA labeling methodology to foster future studies in RNA biology and provide a more comprehensive understanding of how RNA contributes to the complexity of biology and human health."
"9337584","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), specific proteins that are normally soluble, aggregate in either the intra- or extracellular space of the brain. In AD, the aggregation of amyloid-? (A?) appears to initiate disease pathogenesis and the aggregation of tau in specific brain regions is associated with neurodegeneration. Understanding factors that lead to protein aggregation and their spread through specific neural networks will likely provide important insights for development of new treatments. One factor that influences the likelihood that A? or tau will aggregate is concentration. Prior to and over the first 4 years of this PPG, project 1, working with the other PPG investigators, has produced strong evidence that something associated with the sleep wake cycle regulates interstitial fluid (ISF) A? levels at least in part via influencing synaptic activity. Further, manipulations that influence the sleep wake cycle that are linked with increasing or decreasing ISF A? acutely also increase or decrease A? deposition chronically if such changes occur over longer periods of time. While tau is a predominantly a cytosolic protein, we also found that it is present in the ISF and that its levels there can be regulated by excitatory synaptic activity. A key concept that has emerged in neurodegenerative diseases is that certain proteins that aggregate, such as A? and tau, appear to spread within the brain. Once aggregation occurs in one region, protein aggregates will often next appear in another brain region that is in a synaptically connected network. There is strong evidence in AD and in animal models that A? aggregation in some way drives the progression and spread of tauopathy within brain networks. This spread of protein aggregates may occur via a prion-like mechanism. In prior studies of the sleep/wake cycle, we performed manipulations that affect more than just sleep (e.g. stress) and did not specifically affect slow wave sleep. Some important questions remain. Does direct neural manipulation of wakefulness and slow wave sleep have the same effects we have previously seen in regard to A?? Is ISF tau, tau pathology, and tau spreading acutely and chronically affected by the sleep/wake cycle? How does A? influence ISF tau, tau pathology, and tau spreading in the context of changes in the sleep/wake cycle? We hypothesize that ISF A? and A? pathology is strongly affected by the sleep wake cycle and that the ability of A? to drive tauopathy occurs in part via effects of the sleep wake cycle influencing trans synaptic spread of tau aggregates. This hypothesis will be tested in these aims. Aim 1: To directly manipulate slow wave sleep and wakefulness via Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) and determine the acute effects on ISF A? and tau. Aim 2: To determine the effects of modulating the sleep/wake cycle chronically via DREADDs and other methods on A? pathology, tau pathology synaptic integrity, network function, sleep, and behavior in APP/PS1?E9 mice +/- human tau. Aim 3: To determine the effects of modulating the sleep/wake cycle via DREADDs and other methods in a tau spreading model in the presence and absence of A?."
"9314535","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application tests several hypotheses H1 -The human gut microbiota is causally related to obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities; H2 - The microbiota contains bacterial taxa that have effects on both adiposity and obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction including insulin-resistance, as well as taxa that exert selective effects on energy storage or metabolic activities disturbed in obese states; H3 - Diet influences expression of the activities of these groups of organisms; H4- The reduced diversity seen in the microbiota of obese individuals with and without metabolic dysfunction can be 'repaired' by adding microbes whose niches are not well-represented and dietary components that allow these microbes to establish themselves and express health-promoting functions. DK078669 will use a generally applicable translational research pipeline for microbiota-directed diagnostics and therapeutics [discovery of new probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics], Innovative features include (i) recruitment and detailed physiologic/metabolic phenotyping of same-sex female discordant twin-pairs, doubly or singly discordant for lean versus obese, and metabolic healthy versus unhealthy (insulin-resistant) states (abbreviated LnMH/ObMUN, LnMH/ObMH, ObMH/ObMUN), and implementation of controlled in-home diet studies (Project 2); (ii) transplantation of their intact uncultured gut communities, and subsequently extensive bacterial culture collections derived from their microbiota, into gnotobiotic mice fed the same NHANES-based diets as those consumed by the discordant twins during their in-home diet studies, to assess whether human gut communities can transmit their human donor phenotypes to recipient mice and the sensitivity of these transmitted phenotypes to diet (Project 1); (iii) co-housing mice, harboring transplanted microbiota from LnMH/ObMUN, LnMH/ObMH, ObMH/ObMUN pairs to identify taxa from LnMH (and then ObMH ) which ameliorate the increased adiposity and/or metabolic phenotypes associated with ObMUN microbiota, and to determine whether or not the effects are family-specific (to address the question of whether gut restoration has to be a within-family affair) (Project 1); (iv) development of new analytic tools for analyzing multi-omics time series studies of humans and mice (Project 3). Core A is an established metabolomics unit that will provide a combination of broad coverage and analytical precision for defining metabolic phenotypes in human subjects and derived gnotobiotic mouse models. Core B is a data repository for multi-omics datasets and their subsequent deposition in public databases. Our team of highly interactive, interdisciplinary, basic and clinical translational scientists has published 57 PPG papers during the current funding period. Our results suggest that in some obese humans, the gut microbiota is shifted to a state that can sustain obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities, and that filling empty niches in Ob microbiota with Ln-derived taxa requires an diet that allows these taxa to be established and express their health-promoting functions."
"9464830","Abstract As the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, a detailed understanding of the implications of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release remains elusive. The measurement of GABA concentrations is a difficult process. Microdialysis is the current standard for GABA sampling in the brains of freely moving animals, but suffers from low temporal resolution and the need for labor intensive analysis methods. By contrast, the direct sensing of GABA, by modalities including biosensors, would provide second-by-second temporal resolution, without the need for additional post- analysis. However, biosensors and other monitoring devices, require an enzyme to process the analyte of interest. The state-of-the-art for the enzymatic conversion of GABA into a transducible signal is the sequential activity of multiple enzymes or antibodies entrapped within nanoparticles. For brain and systemic GABA sensing applications, a single GABA oxidase enzyme is necessary. No such oxidase enzyme for GABA is currently available. This proposal addresses this problem by designing a single GABA-specific oxidase enzyme for use as the biorecognition element that is suitable for fabrication of a GABA biosensor. During Phase I we identified, isolated, purified, cloned, crystallized and modeled the active-site structure of ?-N- Methylaminobutyrate oxidase (MGOX). We set up a directed evolution system (KJ109) in which there will only be growth if GABA is available as a nitrogen source, and we demonstrated that the preliminary MGOX enzyme can be used on a biosensor to detect GABA. For Phase II of this project, there are two major problems that must be solved: (1) Modification of MGOX to increase its kcat at physiological pH (~pH 7.4); and (2) Modification of MGOX to increase sensitivity to detect physiologically relevant GABA concentrations. Pinnacle will team with an interdisciplinary group of two leading scientists at the University of Kansas. Professor Mark Richter, is an expert in protein engineering and protein folding, and Dr. Philip Gao, is the Director of the Protein Production Core Facility. By the end of Phase II, two commercially available products will be available. First, a GABA biosensor for real-time measurement of physiologically relevant levels of GABA in the brain for preclinical animal models and second, a GABA oxidase enzyme for use in a variety of diagnostic and point-of-care devices."
"9479556","Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel ?population in a dish? experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that ? by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems ? transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms."
"9444131","Project Summary: Project 2, Neural Coding and Dynamics in Neocortical Regions Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability during a working memory and decision task based on accumulation of sensory evidence. Inactivation experiments in another component of the project will identify participating brain areas and their particular roles in such tasks. The goal of this project is to characterize the neural coding and dynamics in the neocortical brain areas found to have a causal role in the behavior. Initial inactivation results suggest that much of neocortex is involved. Thus, the project will produce a broad survey of neocortex using cellular-resolution calcium imaging with the most advanced optical-imaging technology, like the mesoscope. The results of this survey will be a dataset, unprecedented in the ??eld of working memory and decision-making, that will greatly illuminate the nature of each region?s potential contributions and their computations. In parallel, neocortical dynamics will be measured with cell-type speci??city, starting with populations of inhibitory neurons. Preliminary data shows choice-speci??c sequences and cue-locked cells in neocortical pyramidal neurons in six brain regions during an evidence-accumulation task involving navigation in virtual reality, but it is unclear whether these kinds of activity are speci??c to preliminary experiments or will generalize to diverse evidence-accumulation behaviors. To address this question, researchers will apply two-photon, cellular-resolution calcium imaging during other evidence-accumulation tasks, to explore the dependence on species (rat vs. mouse), behavioral readout (T-maze navigation vs. orienting vs. right/left licking), or sensory modality (towers, light ??ashes, airpu??s). The survey of neocortical activity at cellular resolution will be done one or a few areas at a time. Finally, the project will use wide??eld imaging ??uorescence macroscopes, including a novel head-mounted version, for simultaneous imaging of all dorsal cortical areas during evidence-accumulation tasks. The maps will identify, for the ??rst time, the simultaneously acquired spatial and temporal structure of region activation across the neocortical surface during an evidence-accumulation task in rodents. Based on the preliminary data, this work, along with the imaging results obtained in another project component, is expected to produce the most detailed information available to date on brain-wide activity, at cellular resolution, during performance of a cognitive task. Ultimately, these results will be used, in conjunction with perturbation and interaction data from other parts of the project, to develop and constrain biophysically realistic models of the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and decision-making across multiple brain areas.

The specific aims of proposed Investigator Development Core are to: 1) provide multidisciplinary mentored  training on Structural Violence and health disparities research to a diverse group of early stage scholars; 2)  help early stage scholars develop and implement pilot projects on structural inequality and its health effects; 3)  facilitate scholarly activities, such as publications and grant applications; 4) employ ongoing evaluation and  feedback processes to better understand paths to creating collaborative multidisciplinary mentoring and  resource-sharing environment. Our Investigator Development Core will use the social cognitive career theory  (SCCT) to inform our investigator training and career development activities. SCCT focuses on three areas: 1)  mastery experience: successful completion of tasks to build personal capacity; 2) social modeling: peer-  mentoring and group learning to gain solidarity and confidence; and 3) verbal and social persuasion:  continuous feedback and positive mentoring to enhance self-efficacy. Our goal is to prepare a diverse group of  early stage scholars, including post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty, for leadership roles in health disparities  research. To achieve this goal, we will implement the following activities in collaboration with the other two  Cores of the Center: 1) solicit and award three pilot research projects concerning structural violence and health  inequality per year, over the five-year study period; 2) match awardees of pilot projects with content mentor(s)  and meet bi-monthly, 3) host grant writing workshops and writing retreats once a year for five years; 4) provide  ongoing research support and resources; and 5) implement mixed method evaluation and feedback to  understand needs, strengths, limitations, and achievements of promoting diverse, multidisciplinary scholarship."
"9536242","Abstract  Based on mutational studies two decades ago, HIV-1 Integrase (IN) protein has been proposed to play a role in late stages of HIV-1 replication. These mutations, collectively referred to as Class II mutations, adversely affect multiple steps of virus replication including particle assembly, maturation and subsequent reverse transcription. Some class II mutations specifically impair particle maturation leading to the formation of aberrant viral cores in which the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) are mislocalized outside of the conical capsid core. However, for nearly 20 years it has remained enigmatic as to how IN can contribute to proper viral particle maturation.  Allosteric IN inhibitors (ALLINIs) have recently emerged as a promising new class of antiretroviral agents and select compounds are currently in clinical trials. Although ALLINIs were initially designed to block the interaction of IN with its cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75, it has recently been shown that they potently impair the late steps of HIV-1 replication. Similar to certain Class II IN mutations, these inhibitors selectively interfere with proper virus particle maturation and yield non-infectious particles with eccentrically positioned RNPs. Although it has been shown that ALLINIs can promote aberrant IN multimerization, how this event adversely results in the mislocalization of the RNPs outside the capsid core has remained unknown. Based on these observations, we have recently explored the intriguing possibility that IN may bind the viral RNA genome in mature particles and that ALLINIs may interfere with IN-RNA interactions critical for proper particle formation. To test this hypothesis, we have employed the cutting-edge CLIP-seq (crosslinking- immunoprecipitation-sequencing) methodology and complementary biochemical approaches. These studies have revealed for the first time that IN binds to specific sequences on the viral RNA genome and that certain mutations within IN and ALLINIs potently block these interactions. We propose to continue our studies in identifying the details of the mechanism by which ALLINIs affect IN-RNA interactions and how IN-RNA interactions regulate particle maturation. We also propose to use the aberrantly formed eccentric cores generated in the presence of ALLINIs/Class II mutations as a tool to understand the early post-entry events in infection. As such, this project will not only provide unprecedented insight into the novel role of HIV-1 IN in particle assembly and the primary mechanism of action of ALLINIs, but will also facilitate the development of studies to understand early post-entry events in HIV-1 replication."
"9449963","ABSTRACT   In the US, an estimated 1.2 million people are living with HIV. In spite of considerable progress, anti-  retroviral therapy (ART) remains the only treatment option. The long-term success of ART is dependent on  identification of new drugs against novel therapeutic due to toxicity of current drugs and emergence of ART-  resistant viruses. The anti-HIV activity of cellular miRNAs is an emerging area and has a great potential to  identify novel therapeutic targets. However, very little is known about the molecular interactions between  cellular miRNAs and HIV-1. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by  binding to the 3? untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs causing translational repression or mRNA  degradation. miRNAs play fundamental roles in every aspect of cellular process including anti-viral responses.  Published data demonstrate that cellular miRNAs regulate replication of many viruses including Primate foamy  virus, Hepatitis C virus, Epstein Barr virus, Influenza virus and HIV. The overall goal of this application is to  dissect the mechanism by which cellular miRNAs confer anti-HIV activity.   The anti-HIV-1 activity of cellular miRNAs was first discovered by target prediction coupled with  experimental validation. Since then a family of anti-HIV miRNAs has been reported to inhibit HIV-1. Two  mechanisms are proposed for the anti-HIV activities of cellular miRNAs. They can bind to HIV-1 transcripts and  inhibit viral protein translation. Alternatively, they can bind to cellular transcripts and inhibit translation of host  factors associated with viral replication. However, there are key knowledge gaps in the understanding of  miRNA-mediated anti-HIV activity. Our proposed studies on the cellular anti-HIV-1 miRNAs are designed to fill  this gap. The central hypothesis is anti-HIV-1 miRNAs inhibit HIV-1 by repressing viral protein  translation and regulation of anti-HIV miRNAs is dependent on DNMT-assisted promoter hyper-  methylation. This proposal is organized to test the central hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1: To  determine that repression of HIV-1 translation is mediated by direct binding of anti-HIV miRNAs to viral  transcripts. Aim 2: To test that DNMT-induced promoter hyper-methylation regulates anti-HIV miRNA  expression. Aim 3: To elucidate the mechanism by which CpG hyper-methylation causes downregulation of  anti-HIV-1 miRNAs. The approach used in this application utilizes novel methods at the interface of virology,  genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. We strongly believe that data from this proposal will significantly  improve our understanding of anti-HIV-1 activity of cellular miRNAs and facilitate development of novel anti-  viral therapy."

"9390731","ABSTRACT The objective of this competing continuation (renewal) application is to determine whether modifications to a contingency management (CM) intervention improve outcomes and reduce costs in heavy drinkers with serious mental illness (SMI). Up to 46% of adults with SMI experience an alcohol use disorder in their lifetimes. Alcohol use contributes to high rates of homelessness, psychiatric hospitalization, HIV infection, cigarette smoking, and drug use in this population, for which CM is an especially promising treatment. In CM, patients receive tangible rewards for demonstrating drug abstinence. CM for alcohol use requires a biomarker that can detect alcohol use for more than 48 hours after consumption. As no such biomarker was available until recently, little research has investigated CM as a treatment for alcohol use disorders. In our initial funding period we found that the alcohol biomarker ethyl glucuronide (EtG) can detect drinking for up to 5 days when administered as part of a randomized 12-week trial of CM. Those randomized to EtG-based CM were 3 times more likely to submit alcohol-negative EtG tests than controls. CM participants also had lower levels of heavy drinking, stimulant drug use, and cigarette smoking than controls. However, CM was ineffective for participants with an average pre-treatment EtG level that indicated frequent, recent heavy drinking (EtG > 499 ng/mL). We propose to investigate whether 2 strategies ? a) increasing reinforcer magnitude or b) reinforcing light drinking before reinforcing abstinence ? can improve outcomes in heavy drinkers with SMI. While initial research indicates that these strategies are associated with improved outcomes in treatment-resistant drug users and cigarette smokers, no randomized trial has compared them, investigated them in alcohol users or adults with SMI, investigated their relative cost-effectiveness, or investigated modifiers of CM efficacy using a theoretical model. Therefore, we will compare the efficacy of these 2 approaches to the CM intervention implemented in the initial funding period in heavy drinkers with SMI. A total of 400 participants receiving treatment as usual at 2 treatment agencies will take part in a 4-week induction period. Participants (n=240) who attain a mean EtG > 499 ng/mL during the induction period will be randomized to either a) 4 months of standard-magnitude reinforcement CM for submitting alcohol-abstinent EtG samples (EtG < 100 ng/mL) (Usual CM), b) 4 months of high-magnitude CM for submitting alcohol-abstinent EtG samples (High-Magnitude CM), or c) 1 month of CM for submitting alcohol samples that indicate light drinking (EtG < 500 ng/mL), followed by 3 months of CM for submitting alcohol-abstinent EtG samples (Shaping CM). The primary outcome will be EtG-verified alcohol abstinence during the last 3 months of treatment (when all reinforcement is contingent on abstinence) and during 6 months of follow-up. We will also investigate group differences in secondary outcomes, conduct a comprehensive economic analysis of CM conditions, and determine whether variables that make up the NIAAA Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment framework moderate alcohol abstinence in the 3 CM conditions."
"9530807","ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and hypertension are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and world-wide. The autonomic nervous system plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of these diseases and neuraxial modulation provides an important avenue for therapeutic intervention. The major goal of our research team is to precisely define the cardiac neural hierarchy and develop circuit diagrams from the macroscopic to cellular and molecular levels and share these data on an ongoing basis with the scientific community. This effort will also provide verified methods and tools for assessing neuromodulation. The research team will make them freely available to the scientific community. A multiscale, multidisciplinary approach across various species, highly relevant to human disease, will be used to define the anatomy of cardiac innervation in high definition. Neural structure will be linked to cardiac function. The complexity of cardiac neural control necessitates an integrative approach that will represent a tour de force in this field. State-of-the-art anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological approaches from `cells to man' must be combined in order to achieve the above goals. This approach will be utilized at each level of the neuraxis (heart, extracardiac intrathoracic neural structures and extrathoracic neural structures). The techniques proposed will allow, for the first time, a detailed description of the anatomical and molecular interactions at the synaptic and cell body levels in cardiac and extracardiac ganglia. The techniques used and the integration of these pathways represents the most innovative attempt to understand cardiac neural control ever undertaken. Understanding these pathways has the potential to accelerate development of therapies that will be able to precisely target neural structures and also guide methods to re-purpose already available therapies (e.g. nerve stimulators) for therapeutic purposes. Ultimately, these approaches are required to develop novel, effective, and affordable interventions for the management and prevention of heart disease and sudden cardiac death."
"9514389","Overall Project Summary: The University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) was created in 2007 against a backdrop of institutional change at UW during which the UW Medical School pivoted to become a School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH, 2005) and the other Health Sciences Schools retooled their missions to encompass health maintenance, preventative care, and improvements in health-delivery systems. Since its inception, ICTR succeeded in changing the culture of research at UW and at Marshfield Clinic (MC) and became recognized as the academic and administrative home for clinical and translational science. This section outlines the most notable ICTR accomplishments leading to transformative changes in the broad areas of administration, education of the translational workforce, and expansion of the research infrastructure. Many of the administrative successes were aligned with development of mutually- beneficial, collaborative relationships including the foundational UW and MC partnership, establishment of multi-site research networks, cross-CTSA program development, braided federal and local funding for ICTR programs and pilot awards, and affiliation with other UW centers and programs with overlapping missions. Translational workforce development included creating vigorous TL1 and KL2 training programs, establishing graduate degree and certificate programs in Clinical Investigation, and offering diverse non-degree options for learners at multiple levels and tracks. Additional collaborative efforts led to a nationally recognized program in research mentor training and the Health Equity Leadership Institute, a career development experience for investigators engaged in health disparities/health equity research. The central fact illustrating the expansion of the UW research infrastructure is that ICTR resources and services supported ~2,500 unique investigators, who have pursued 3,824 research projects. ICTR has provided pilot funding across the T0-T4 translational spectrum including awards specific to pediatric, geriatric, and minority populations. Consultations and other expert services span biostatistics, bioinformatics, laboratory services, and an array of clinical and regulatory services. Finally, the ICTR community engagement program is recognized as a national model for how to create partnerships with community stakeholders and organizations (431 to date) and now includes dissemination and implementation programs. Significantly, this section also provides examples of how ICTR- supported research programs have already impacted health care and health in Wisconsin and nationally. In the next grant cycle, ICTR will continue to address translational workforce development with an emphasis on team science and competency-based training, and community engagement in research with novel strategies for implementation of health advances and involvement of patient advocates. Additionally, the research infrastructure will be continuously improved through cycles of quality improvement and innovation and informatics methods for translational research will be introduced. Special populations research will be integrated across the T0-T4 spectrum and across the lifespan. Project Summary/Abstract Page 126 Contact PD/PI: DREZNER, MARC K  Overall - CTSA As a member of the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards program since 2007, the mission of the University of Wisconsin (UW) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is to improve public health by translating basic research discoveries into direct, practical improvements in clinical care and health care delivery systems. Current ICTR-supported research programs have already directly impacted community health in Wisconsin and nationally.

"9420945","Abstract A decade of genomic studies has revealed the landscape of mutations appearing in the genomes of Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AML). A subset of these mutations have been identified as AML-initiating events that create growth advantages in a hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC). This leads to the early stages of disease, but the mechanisms by which these mutations act is poorly understood. This research program will study key AML-initiating events in both primary tumors and mouse models by generating comprehensive whole-genome transcriptomic and epigenomic data (RNA-seq, bisulfite-seq, ATAC-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, et al). My role will be to translate these large, complex data sets into conclusions and testable hypotheses about the precise molecular mechanisms by which these specific genetic mutations initiate AML. Doing so will require the development of new algorithms and statistical models, both areas of bioinformatics in which I am proficient. We will then leverage this knowledge to develop novel therapies. A second key question focuses on the 50% of AML patients who initially experience complete remission after chemotherapy, but ultimately relapse. Our previous work has shown that genome sequencing can often identify persistent leukemia-associated mutations in post-chemotherapy biopsies from these patients, even when they are in morphological remission. This lack of mutation clearance was strongly associated with risk of relapse, but was not absolutely predictive: a few patients with persistent mutations experienced long remissions, and others who cleared all mutations quickly relapsed. Two remaining questions with important clinical implications are: 1) Can sequencing of biopsies from additional post-treatment timepoints better define the trajectory of mutation clearance and offer additional prognostically useful information? 2) Could ultra-deep sequencing have detected the residual disease responsible for relapse, thus prompting earlier interventions? Having co-led the original mutation clearance study, and authored tools for tracking a tumor's clonal evolution through therapy, I have the required expertise to deign these studies, and analyze, visualize, and interpret these data. We are beginning clinical trials that use clearance to assign patients to more or less aggressive treatments and providing more clarity on the above questions will be a key part of translating these findings into robust clinical tests. My interdisciplinary skillset couples a deep understanding of the biology of AML with statistical acumen and expertise in designing new algorithms. My training, experience, and record of successful scientific contributions make me uniquely suited to drive the informatics and analysis aspects of these projects forward."
"9431661","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The candidate has recently been expanding his strong expertise in molecular biology of solid cancer to embrace important skills and concepts in RNA biology, hematopoiesis and leukemia, and to transition to an independent researcher. His long-term goals are to understand how lineage-control transcription factors having tumor suppressor functions are regulated in normal and malignant hematopoiesis and to exploit this understanding in modulating their expression for preventative and therapeutic purposes. The objective of his KO1 proposal is to determine how PU.1, a critical master hematopoietic transcription factor is regulated in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. PU.1 is also a key tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PU.1 expression in myeloid cells is induced by the interaction between the distal enhancer termed the upstream regulatory element (URE), and the proximal promoter region (PrPr). Reduction in PU.1 expression levels due to URE deletion has severe impacts on myeloid cell development leading to AML development. It remains unclear what regulates URE-PrPr long-range interaction. In this study, the candidate will determine the role and mechanism by which an enhancer RNA regulates PU.1 expression in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The following specific aims will be pursued: (1) to identify that the enhancer RNA induces PU.1 expression and is important for normal hematopoiesis, (2) to define the mechanism by which it induces PU.1 expression at the chromatin level, and (3) to establish that it inhibits AML progression by restoring proper chromatin structure at the PU.1 locus thereby leading to PU.1 reactivation. Completion of these aims will provide new insights into the nuclear functions of noncoding RNAs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis, and provide a scientific basis for reactivating tumor suppressor genes by restoring proper chromatin structure. Ultimately, this could be expected to result in the development of novel molecular therapeutic approaches for AML. These aims will be achieved by using a variety of approaches including RNA interactions and gene regulation via chromatin structure with the use of transgenic, knockout and engraftment mouse models. During the award period, the candidate will focus on attaining new skills related to these proposed approaches, building his expertise and conceptual knowledge regarding gene regulation by ncRNAs in hematopoiesis and leukemia, and obtaining independent RO1-type grant. The candidate has assembled a strong mentor team. His primary mentor, Dr. Daniel Tenen, is a well-known expert in gene regulation of hematopoiesis and leukemia. In addition, the external advisor committee will monitor his research and career development progress. Furthermore, he has unparalleled access to resources and expertise at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and neighboring Harvard-affiliated institutions. Therefore, the candidate has the expertise, motivation, mentorship and academic environment necessary to successfully accomplish his proposed studies and build his independent research program."
"9463173","Project Summary Esophageal sensory (afferent) nerves are essential for regulation of esophageal sensory-motor function and contribute to many clinical symptoms (dysphagia, odynophagia, nausea, non-cardiac chest pain, refractory heartburn, etc.) when stimulated or dysregulated in diseases. Therefore, the neuromodulation of esophageal afferent nerves is expected to provide relief in many conditions. Progress in advancing neuromodulatory approaches targeting esophageal afferent nerves is hampered by our limited understanding of key aspects of their neurobiology. In this three-year proposal we will focus on two such highly relevant understudied areas. First, the location of the nerve terminals within different esophageal compartments. This is essential for understanding of their role in esophageal diseases, and for design and placement of neuromodulation interfaces. Second, we will obtain data that will advance our understanding of the ion channels underlying action potential conduction in esophageal afferent nerves, which will inform development and optimization of electrical neuromodulation strategies. We will address these issues not only in the guinea pig and mouse but also in the esophagus and isolated esophageal nerves obtained from human donors. Aim 1 will elucidate the location of nerve terminals and axons of C-fiber subtypes in the esophagus. We hypothesize that the neural crest- and placodes-derived C-fibers innervate distinct esophageal tissue compartments (mucosa vs. muscle, respectively). We will address our hypothesis by selective visualization of placodes- vs. neural crest-derived axon and terminals with selective AAV-virus vector-GPF transfection in guinea pig and transgenic mice and evaluate key findings in human donor whole esophagi. In Aim 2, we will obtain the complete trascriptomes of esophageal afferent nerve types focusing on ion channels that mediate action potential conduction (especially NaVs and KVs). We hypothesize that the trascriptomes of the neural crest-derived (vagal jugular and spinal DRG) C-fiber neurons are similar but distinct from those of placodes-derived nodose C-fibers and mechanosensors (including NaVs and KVs). We will perform deep RNAseq analysis on neurons retrogradely labeled from the esophagus in TRPV1-tdTomato mice and validate the expression of Nav and Kv by qRT-PCR. We will also analyze vagal nodose and jugular neurons in Cynomolgus monkey. Aim 3 will evaluate the role of ion channels underlying action potential conduction in esophageal afferent nerve types by electrophysiology. We will initially evaluate the role of the various NaV (NaV1.1 ?NaV 1.9) subtypes, and later on KV channels. We hypothesize that conduction in esophageal afferent nerve types is mediated not only by Nav1.7, but also other tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive channels, possibly distinct between the neural crest- and placodes-derived C-fibers (NaV1.1/1.6 vs. NaV1.2/1.3). This will be investigates in guinea pig and mouse innervated esophagus preparation using pharmacological tools and shRNA knockdown, and in human esophageal nerves."
"9444236","EM Core - Abstract While the neural circuits that underlie behavior are of interest to all of the investigators on this grant (and a substantial part of the entire neuroscience community), there have been very few technical approaches that actually provide this kind of information across all levels at which circuits function, including the level of synaptic connections. This electron microscopy core is explicitly designed to provide the ?wiring diagrams? of neural circuits in an efficient way. Much of our effort over the past 5 years has been to transform serial electron microscopy of large volumes (such as the fish nervous system) from a heroic to a more mundane enterprise. This transformation required innovations in hardware and software to abbreviate all the time-consuming steps in the connectomic pipeline. In particular we: 1) automated ultra-thin sectioning (using a tape-based approach), 2) automated image acquisition (using a custom multibeam serial electron microscope), 3) automated stitching and registration of the image data on high performance computing clusters, 4) automated segmentation of neurons and synapses on a GPU cluster, and 5) semi-automated proofreading and rendering of the neural circuits with custom software. Because of these developments, we can routinely collect tens of thousands of sections losslessly at 30 nm thickness and acquire images of them at lateral resolutions of 4 x 4 nanometers. This voxel size (480 nm3? ?) provides enough detail for human or machine vision methods to trace out the finest aspects of neural connectivity. Obtaining this information about neural circuits is relevant inasmuch as it provides insight into circuit function. Hence the tremendous benefit of doing electron microscopy on functionally imaged samples - a main goal of this proposal. Acquiring these circuits is also relevant if neuronal connectivity can be associated with cells of particular types, hence the significant benefit of doing analysis of cell types that have been defined in the fish atlas associated with this proposal. Finally, these circuit diagrams provide ground truth for testing and refining computational theories of brain function, another important prong of this proposal. Because of the speed of the EM Core approaches, we have the ability to acquire datasets of many different fish that each have been used in particular experimental or live-cell imaging contexts. The overarching goal being to provide synaptic level structural information for all research questions where such detailed data can enhance our comprehension of the way fish behavior is instantiated in its nervous system."
"9433322","Research Plan Abstract The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of small molecules without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use a gas-phase molecular property, collision cross section, that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes a high throughput, high accuracy, quantum-chemistry-based computational and chemical informatics platform to predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites from first principles."
"9413733","Musculoskeletal disorders are common and result in significant disability and health care costs. Advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders requires a robust clinical research infrastructure and improved classification of the various disorders. The latter is critical to precision or personalized medicine approaches as many musculoskeletal disorders have common clinical presentations of pain and impaired physical function despite diverse pathophysiology. Furthermore, research to date often focuses on bone or muscle and not how they interact. The overarching theme of the Indiana Core Center for Clinical Research (ICCCR) is to enhance clinical research in musculoskeletal disorders and to understand the muscle-bone connection by better defining, or phenotyping, this broad class of disorders in order to advance clinical research. The ICCCR will leverage campus resources of our CTSA that includes Indiana and Purdue Universities, our statewide healthcare system IU Health, the Regenstrief Institute's statewide electronic health record system, and the Precision Health Initiative to enhance clinical research. The ICCCR will work with Thematic Teams of multi-disciplinary investigators to create innovative ways to think about musculoskeletal disorder phenotypes. The ICCCR will support individuals to connect investigators and Thematic Teams to the methodologic and resource cores thereby facilitating access to and help in conducting research that 1) utilizes our vast network of electronic health records, omics, and bioinformatics group to create computable, genetic and molecular phenotypes, 2) develops standardized physical function and imaging modalities to develop functional and morphologic phenotypes, and 3) expands the Indiana Biobank's musculoskeletal tissue and blood resources. The ICCCR will work with community and industry partners to facilitate recruitment and technology transfer and provide pilot funding to support new research. These new and innovative initiatives under the ICCCR will link our musculoskeletal researchers of Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Research to state of the art resources to identify novel targets for diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. We will challenge the traditional approach of bench to bedside research to instead focus on patient phenotype to bench and back research. This will improve the definition and diagnosis of the many musculoskeletal disorders to diseases that have common pathogenesis and clinical presentations, facilitating personalized medicine by focusing the right treatment for each patient."

"9394349","Project Summary  The applicant, Mr. Kenneth Feder, proposes to investigate and quantify the collateral consequences of the United States' ongoing prescription opioid and heroin epidemic for children who are growing up in households and communities where adults engage in illicit use of these substances. This research will be conducted as part of the applicant's doctoral training, which, in addition to the proposed dissertation project, will also include: (a) mentorship from directors and faculty of two academic public health Centers at Johns Hopkins dedicated to child sexual abuse prevention and mental health and addiction policy respectively; (b) coursework in biostatistical methods and social and family policy; and (c) opportunities to build research dissemination skills including didactic presentations, grant-writing, and refereed publications. The proposed research and training will prepare the applicant for a career as an independent investigator studying the impact of family substance use and mental illness on child wellbeing and children's need for public health and child welfare services.  The United States is in the midst of an epidemic of illicit opioid use. While most research on the opioid epidemic has focused on adults, the extent of illicit opioid use is likely having negative collateral consequences for the children. In particular, children growing in households and neighborhoods where adults engage in illicit opioid use may be at increased risk for exposure to trauma. Because an abundance of evidence links trauma exposure to both adolescent and adult adverse health outcomes, the opioid epidemic's impact on children presents a long-term threat to population health that may echo across generations and into the future. Currently, there is insufficient research on the population health impact of caregiver and community opioid use to inform the public health response to the ongoing epidemic. There are no recent estimates of trends in children's exposure to illicit parent or caregiver opioid use, no estimates of the collateral health, behavioral, or educational consequences of parent or caregiver opioid use in representative samples, and no estimates of increased child welfare contact attributable to the epidemic. The applicant proposes a multi-part investigation of the opioid epidemic's impact on children. The proposed project will examine 1) children's exposure to caregiver illicit opioid, 2) harmful consequences of this exposure, and 3) changes in child victimization and use of child welfare services resulting from rising rates of opioid use. All Aims will be investigated with existing public surveys and administrative data conducive to reproducible research and immediate policy application.  The proposed project is consistent with NIDA's goal to increase the public health impact of its research ? specifically, with the objective to ?determine the impact of drug use and addiction on individuals, families, peers, and society.? The project is also addresses a priority funding topic ? the ongoing opioid epidemic."

By accomplishing these specific aims, we will centralize operations, increase efficiencies  and create a more robust infrastructure for research services and training. This  enhanced, unified strategic direction and execution will allow for uniformity, prioritizing  future directions, and increased productivity by reducing redundancies in previously  separate operations. The transformation of the space and cores into a more efficient and  highly integrated research services suite will lower the startup cost burden of the newly  recruited faculty while also providing excellent service value for our existing researchers.!"
"9271763","ABSTRACT Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women (YTW) aged 18-29 remain at high risk for HIV infection, particularly YMSM and YTW of color. Such disparities cannot be attributed to individual-level behaviors alone. Age and racial disparities have been associated with a number of social determinants of HIV, including: limited awareness, low perceived risk, small sexual networks with high density of STIs and HIV, inadequate access to HIV prevention services, and more recently poor PrEP awareness, knowledge, access, and uptake.  Although PrEP is available and approved for adults ages 18 and older, demonstration studies show that less than 15% of current PrEP users identify as Black. In a Chicago-based study, by Schneider et al., only 41% of Black YMSM and YTW surveyed were aware of PrEP, only 12% knew someone who had taken PrEP, and only 4% had used PrEP. PrEP awareness was significantly associated with having a primary care provider, participation in HIV programs or studies, having had a STI screening, and being a member of the House & Ball community. However, in 2009 only 1% of primary care providers reported ever prescribing PrEP, this increased only to 7% by 2015. Thus, although PrEP is a promising biomedical intervention for HIV prevention, its uptake among Black YMSM and YTW, two groups at risk for HIV, appears to be undermined by critical contextual factors?awareness, knowledge, and access. Innovative, low-cost, scalable structural-level interventions that address these barriers and engage hard-to-reach populations, are needed to maximize PrEP?s potential for impacting the HIV epidemic.  The proposed study seeks to develop and pilot-test a novel structural-level community pharmacy-based PrEP intervention that includes: (1) the development of a digital PrEP information kiosk, and (2) PrEP educational training and referral system for pharmacy staff. The ubiquity, accessibility, and potential for non- stigmatized, population-directed PrEP information and consultation access make community pharmacies an important venue for exploration. Ultimately, this intervention has the potential to reach and engage a large number of eligible PrEP users who might not necessarily be connected with other HIV prevention programs or venues where PrEP information is disseminated (e.g., House & Ball, LGBT). The proposed study is responsive to the NIH HIV/AIDS high priority topic by specifically addressing health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and access to treatment. Further, this proposal includes populations at elevated risk for HIV infection and addresses health and social issues that are clearly linked with HIV.  Study findings will directly lead to a subsequent multi-site pharmacy randomized controlled trial of the pharmacy-based PrEP intervention kiosk and pharmacy staff educational training for increasing PrEP awareness, knowledge, and initiation among Black YMSM and YTW.

"9479862","PROJECT SUMMARY- PROJECT 1 Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex and medically unexplained illness, characterized by severe and debilitating fatigue that is not ameliorated by rest, and a constellation of symptoms, including musculoskeletal pain, sore throat, headaches, impaired concentration and short-term memory, and sleep disturbances. There are no scientifically validated tests for the illness, nor are there widely accepted therapies, leading to a great deal of uncertainty among clinicians when evaluating patients with prolonged, unexplained, and debilitating psycho-physical fatigue. Discovery of ME/CFS-specific biomarkers that can advance our understanding of the illness and its pathogenic mechanisms, differentiate the disorder from overlapping or comorbid diagnoses, and identify potential treatment targets is, therefore, currently a pressing and unmet research and public health need. The overall objective of this component of the present ME/CFS Collaborative Research Centers (CRCs) (U54) grant proposal is to begin filling this knowledge gap by using advanced neuroimaging techniques to test and then validate a pathophysiological model of ME/CFS which posits that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation and, possibly, a secondary mitochondrial dysfunction, are intertwined mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of the disorder. Specifically, this study will aim to: (a) use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to measure in vivo brain levels of glutathione (GSH) -- the most abundant antioxidant in the central nervous system ? as a marker of oxidative stress; (b) use 1H MRS to measure in vivo brain levels of lactate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) as markers of mitochondrial dysfunction; (c) use 31P MRS to measure in vivo brain levels of ATP, creatine phosphate (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) as complementary indices of mitochondrial dysfunction; (d) use in vivo brain 11C-(R)-PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET) to measure the binding potential of the ligand as a marker of neuroinflammation; and (f) measure circulating markers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress for corroborating the proposed neuroimaging biomarkers. To ensure that the effects of the disease rather than those of the cohorts will be investigated, all the proposed neuroimaging scans and blood samples assays will be performed before and following symptom provocation with cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET), known to trigger post-exertional malaise (PEM) in ME/CFS patients. If successfully completed, the proposed research will have the potential to shed new light onto the neurobiological mechanisms and underpinnings of ME/CFS to advance our understanding of the illness, and establish ME/CFS-specific biomarkers for differentiating the disorder from overlapping or comorbid diagnoses, and identifying potential treatment targets."
"9465064","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The US Surgeon General reports that skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the US. The number of Americans who have had skin cancer at some point over the last three decades is estimated to exceed all other cancers combined. There are more than 75,000 new cases of melanoma each year, resulting in more than 10,000 deaths. Reports indicate that nearly 90% of skin cancers are caused by UV exposure, and despite the risks many Americans continue to subject themselves to harmful levels of UV partly because it is burdensome to accurately assess one's UV dose. Furthermore, the experience of sunburn or even melanoma often do not provide sufficient motivation to change sun behavior. Wearable UV monitors offer potential remedy, but existing devices are expensive, obtrusive, and often incompatible with water recreation. Their intrinsic operational mode has inaccuracy derived from intermittent measurements and interpolative algorithms to infer dose. These shortcomings cause non-adoption, improper use or discontinuation, limiting their ability to prevent overexposure, sunburn, and skin cancer. A critical unmet need is for a low cost, unobtrusive sun protection system that combines accurate dosimetry with user-responsive software interfaces capable of influencing healthy behavior.  The proposed work addresses the need with a breakthrough sensor technology and an innovative user interface that enables informed sun-protection behavior. The sensors are pea-sized battery-free ?stickers? with fundamentally differentiated modes of use, cost structures, and accuracy. Uninterrupted charge accumulation imparts continuous UV-A and UV-B measurement capability with greater accuracy than any alternative. The result is a personal dosimeter with vanishingly small obtrusiveness and correspondingly small cost, allowing ?giveaway? distribution strategies. Real-time messages triggered by user-specific exposure will promote healthy sun behavior in the general population and at-risk segments, including those with medicine-induced photo- sensitivities or diseases that increase sensitivity to the sun.  Activities in Phase I will establish the accuracy of the sensors through systematic comparisons to (non- wearable) laboratory instrumentation and produce a mobile app with bi-directional communications based on UV tolerances specific to the user's skin type. Focus groups will assess the usability of the system and its likelihood to influence sun-protection behavior. Phase 2 activities will optimize designs for cost and reliability in real-world conditions, with targets of <$2 per device and robust operation during/after watersports and heavy sweating. Successful completion of these tasks will enable assessment of the technology in prospective cohort studies in high-risk populations of melanoma survivors aged 18-49. Extended (90 day) behavior studies of 100 individuals will determine compliance (target >85%) and user-satisfaction (target >70%) to confirm broad acceptability and efficacy in influencing healthy sun behavior."
"9276258","SUMMARY The theme of our BETRNet Research Center (RC) is to identify genetic determinants of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) to enable genetic marker guided early detection, risk stratification, prevention and therapy. The BETRNet Patients Registry-Virtual Biorepository (PRVB) Core will interact with all RC investigators at our participating institutions to continue and improve the effective methods and designs that successfully enabled us to share human biospecimens and clinical data across institutions to efficiently achieve our project goals in our existing BETRNet and will enable success in our new projects. We communicate regularly with our RC investigators to make sure they have access to high quality, clinically annotated biospecimens for their research questions. In addition, the Core provides infrastructure and oversight for secure management of all biospecimen, clinical, demographic and molecular data from the BETRNet RC, working closely with our investigators and the BETRNet Administrative Core. The Core will ensure adherence to data sharing in adherence with the guidelines as outlined from the BETRNet Coordinating Center and the NCI BETRNet Program Office in order to provide biospecimens and data to other BETRNet RCs for research."
"9408997","PROJECT SUMMARY It is estimated that ~60% of anti-cancer small molecules and up to 80% of late-stage investigational compounds are poorly soluble in water, and such compounds are often associated with significant clinical problems, such as inconsistent dosing and variable pharmacokinetics (PK). Dasatinib is an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) indicated for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Marketed formulations of dasatinib exhibit a number of solubility issues, including pH-dependent solubility, significant drug interactions with antacids, and inter-dose and inter-patient variability. Inconsistent dosing and variable bioavailability can lead to significant therapeutic problems, such as adverse events, poor patient adherence, and decreased clinical efficacy. In this Phase I SBIR project, MAA Laboratories will use their proprietary drug delivery technology (the NanoContTM) to create a stable nanoformulation of dasatinib, which is expected to have improved solubility and oral bioavailability relative to the marketed dasatinib formulation. The NanoContTM drug delivery technology is built on a continuous manufacturing platform and uses a combination of proprietary formulations and process conditions and a patented polymer-coating process to create drug nanoformulations (i.e. composed of pharmaceutical crystals ~100 nm in diameter) with unchanged crystals, long-term product stability (>2 years), and enhanced clinical benefits. The specific objective of this proposal is to advance one of MAA's initial nanoformulated drug products, dasatinib (MAAC-002), through formulation development and preclinical studies, including side-by- side performance comparisons with the currently marketed dasatinib formulation. The central hypothesis of this SBIR Phase I project is that the NanoContTM drug delivery technology can be used to create a stable nanoformulation of dasatinib that exhibits improved oral bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency relative to the currently marketed dasatinib formulation. In Aim 1, an optimized nanoformulation of MAAC-002 will be generated and aqueous solubility and in vitro dissolution will be measured relative to the marketed formulation of dasatinib. In Aim 2, the oral bioavailability of MAAC-002 will be investigated relative to the marketed formulation in nude mice. In Aim 3, we will perform preclinical anti-leukemia therapeutic efficiency studies in mice using multiple ascending doses of MAAC-002 and the dasatinib marketed formulation. The proposed studies will establish proof-of-concept for a novel nanoformulation of dasatinib using direct comparisons to the marketed formulation. A successful result will generate an optimized MAAC-002 product with an improved PK profile, and will prepare this product for IND-enabling safety/toxicology studies and IND submission as part of an SBIR Phase II project."
"9435189","The goal of this proposal is to identify novel, activity-dependent mechanisms by which microglia interact with neural circuits and regulate plasticity of synapses. Neuronal activity is a critical regulator of synaptic architecture. Both in the developing brain and during adulthood, changes in activity drives the formation of new synapses, elimination of less active synapses, and maintenance of more active synapses. Despite over 50 years of research, the mechanisms by which neuronal activity drives changes in synaptic connectivity remain to be fully deciphered. Unexpectedly, we discovered that microglia, resident central nervous system (CNS) macrophages, are regulated by neuronal activity and engulf and prune away less active synapses in the healthy developing visual system. Further studies have identified similar microglial synaptic pruning functions in other brain regions as well as functions in synaptogenesis and neural transmission. These data compel us to consider microglia as key cellular regulators of synaptic connectivity and evoke the paradigm shifting possibility that disruptions in microglial function result in synaptic defects (density, transmission, etc.) in a wide range of neurological disorders ranging from autism to Alzheimer?s disease. Here, we propose that changes in neuronal activity elicit activity-dependent genetic programs in microglia necessary for regulating synaptic connectivity. We will focus our analyses on microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. In support of this hypothesis, we recently silenced excitatory neurons in the adult brain using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDS) followed by microglia-specific translating ribosomal affinity purification and RNA sequencing (TRAP-seq). Sequencing results revealed rapid induction of phagocytic pathways in microglia following acute neuronal silencing. We will now use our newly developed in vitro assays to molecularly dissect the function of these phagocytosis-related genes in microglia-dependent synaptic engulfment (Aim 1). To identify new molecules relevant to activity-dependent synaptic pruning during brain development, we will also perform microglia-specific TRAP-seq in a paradigm we recently identified to robustly upregulate microglial synaptic engulfment in response to changes in sensory experience in vivo?whisker deprivation-induced synapse elimination in the mouse barrel cortex (Aim 2). We will again use our in vitro assays to assess microglial synaptic engulfment and validate gene hits. Using our combined expertise in cell- specific TRAP-seq (A. Schaefer lab) and microglial synaptic pruning (D. Schafer lab), we have a unique and powerful advantage to identify novel mechanisms regulating activity-dependent microglia-synapse interactions necessary for modulating synaptic connectivity. Long term, we will collaborate to explore these mechanisms in vivo and determine whether mechanisms are dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders with known defects in microglial inflammatory state and synaptic connectivity."
"9386628","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mission and themes. This is an application for renewal of a George M. O'Brien Kidney Research Core Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas currently directed by Dr. Orson Moe who is Professor of Internal Medicine and Physiology, and Chief of the Division of Nephrology at UT Southwestern. The overall mission of the Center is to promote bidirectional synergistic interactions between basic scientists and clinical researchers, maximally optimize research for renal investigators, and encourage and facilitate non-renal researchers to study renal questions. Our three main themes are: 1. Kidney development and genetics. 2. Physiology and pathophysiology. 3. Chronic kidney disease and its complications Need for Center. Discoveries in renal science is emerging at an alarming rate and from diverse circumstances. No single laboratory or investigator can take their findings through development into full biologic elucidation and eventual clinical applications. Researchers outside the renal field often make interesting findings pertinent to kidney disease but lack the ability to pursue the finding due to lack of knowledge, reagents, models, and techniques. This gap needs to be bridged so opportunities of discovery will not be missed, and we can also increase the number of renal investigators. Within the renal research community, basic scientists need appropriate and extensive phenotyping, to translate their findings to clinical application. Clinical researcher also need bench clarification of clinical findings to elucidation mechanisms, and robust systems to discover new biomarkers and treatment. Bidirectional translation is a central purpose of our Center. Our ultimate goal is to improve diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases. Number of Center Members and Direct Cost. Our Center houses 12 Center Members, which are UT Southwestern faculty holding a title within and directly supported by the O'Brien Center. We have 254 Core Members, who are on or off campus users of the O'Brien Center. The direct cost requested is about $749,000 per year. The Center is subsidized by the Renal Division and by UT Southwestern so the real operating cost actually exceeds the allowed budget. Overview of research base, Biomedical Cores, P&F Program and Enrichment Program. The Center supports all research with some relationship to kidney function and disease. Many basic scientists work on highly fundamental biologic problems such as atherosclerosis, autophagy, cellular protein trafficking, diabetes, find scientific merit in using the kidney as model systems and we are delighted that we can attract such investigators to renal investigation. We fulfil our role via three portals- infrastructure support, education, and fiscal support to jumpstart pilot projects. Biomedical Research Cores. Four Cores are designed to provide the infrastructure to bridge the full span for bidirectional translation. (A) The Animal Core distributes and helps generate genetically modified mice as well as create disease models for full phenotyping by two other Cores. (B) The Physiology Core provides functional phenotyping enabling the study of a wide variety of whole organism function. (C) Cell Biology, Pathology, and Imaging Core supports anatomic and functional phenotyping from the whole organism to the single cell. (D) The Clinical Translational Core facilitates bidirectional translation of findings to fulfil our objective. Enrichment Program. We provide education through several means. We have a bimonthly seminar series with lecturers on campus as well as invited speakers to cover many aspects of kidney function and disease. In addition, we have an annual Symposium where specific topics are covered by leading experts in the field. Our Biomedical Cores also provide theoretically and technical training to investigators. Finally, our O'Brien Center hosts several summer projects to educate and motivate students to enter renal research. Pilot and Feasibility Program. In the preliminary phase of hypothesis testing, investigators frequently do not have adequate data for extramural grant application. Our P&F program funds two grants from junior investigators or senior investigators considering an excursion from their trajectory to venture into kidney research. We have an excellent track record of previous grantees submitting and obtaining grants. The mechanisms outlined serves a large body of investigators in the US and abroad to make advances in kidney development and genetics, physiology and pathophysiology, and chronic kidney disease, to advance the diagnosis and treatment of human kidney disease."
"9392490","It is very important to uncover therapeutic strategies to combat the chronic effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) because currently, there are no effective treatments to prevent these cognitive deficits. Unfortunately, TBI is a very common affliction of military forces that have served in recent combat operations. At least 15% of deployed personnel receive a TBI and the total number of such injuries has been estimated as high as 320,000. In the US alone it is estimated that at least 1.7 million people suffer a TBI each year and the worldwide incidence is approximately 0.5% per year. The vast majority of TBIs experienced by military personnel are classified as mild injuries, but these do result in significant, chronic effects. We seek to demonstrate an effective treatment that could reduce or reverse the long-term cognitive dysfunction that is produced by mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because these injuries involve multiple effects, it is necessary to further characterize the treatment effects on the lasting dendritic and spine changes induced by TBI and add to our knowledge of therapeutic changes that are possible so that TBI patients will benefit. Over the past several years, our lab has discovered that an activator of an antioxidant transcription factor, Nrf2, can be neuroprotective by regulating molecular mechanisms that are important to the health of neurons. This has led us to formulate a hypothesis that treatment of mild traumatic brain injury with the Nrf2 activator will result in significant improvement on the connections between neurons, promote neuroprotective intracellular pathways, and result in greatly enhanced long-term outcomes following TBI. We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims: 1. Prevention of the chronic behavioral effects of mild closed head injury by tBHQ treatment, 2. Improvement of persistent connectivity changes produced by tBHQ treatment after mild TBIs, and 3. Identify molecular changes induced by the post TBI treatment that could influence long-term function. We will examine changes to molecular and long-term cognitive function after mild TBI accomplished by the closed head impact injury model in mice. We will use a well-established TBI model involving a closed head injury model that does include rotation. We will treat injured and sham injured groups with either vehicle or tBHQ. Behavioral tests will be conducted at 1, 6, and 12 months after injury. Brain samples will also be collected and examined for dendritic complexity, spine density, and neuron numbers. Finally, levels of neuropathological pathway markers will be examined at early and late (12 month) time points, all to study the effects of the post-injury treatment. In this way we will answer several key questions about the treatment of the long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury, how the treatment will affect molecular events that have lasting consequences after injury, what happens to dendritic complexity after treatment at lengthy times after mild injury, and the extent to which the treatment induced changes in specific regulatory factors can have an effect on downstream neuronal function. Elucidating the effects of the treatment after mild traumatic brain injuries over a year following the injury will help us determine an effective therapeutic solution to the problem of chronic TBI effects."
"9240004","Recent work has revealed an unexpected role for the anionic phospholipid, palmitoyl-oleoyl- phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) as an antagonist of multiple Toll-like receptors, and a potent inhibitor of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. The emerging view is that POPG functions as a decoy ligand for multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs 1,2,3,4 and 6) and competitively blocks their engagement by native ligands present on microbes. Likewise, the phospholipid competitively inhibits recognition of the cell surface attachment ligands for RSV and IAV and thereby prevents the viruses from binding to the plasma membrane and infecting epithelial cells. Currently, the general features of POPG action against TLRs and viruses are clearly understood from in vitro and in vivo studies, but the specific molecular mechanisms of action have not been elucidated. In this proposal we will focus upon the physical interactions of POPG and related phospholipids with Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the recently emergent pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. The goals are to define the structural features of phospholipids, TLR3 and the envelope proteins of pH1N1 that are essential for the lipid-protein interactions and the subsequent inhibition of biological effects. To accomplish these goals we will pursue three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will examine the elements of lipid structure required to inhibit TLR3 activation and IAV infection by using a library of POPG analogs. In Aim 2, we will identify the phospholipid binding site on TLR3 and determine its relationship to the double stranded RNA binding sites on the molecule. In Aim 3, we will identify the POPG binding site(s) on pH1N1 envelope protein(s) and determine its relationship to the sialic acid binding domain of the H1 protein. From these studies we expect to define specific molecular interactions and mechanisms by which POPG and structurally related molecules suppress IAV infection and the TLR3-dependent inflammatory processes that follow viral infection. This information will provide new pharmacological insights for preventing and treating IAV infections and reducing the pathological consequences of the inflammatory sequelae. There is significant potential for this work to identify novel lipids that will function as antagonists of newly emergent and highly virulent strains of IAV."

"9459035","Project Summary / Abstract This application to join the Consortium on Targeting And Regeneration as part of the Human Islet Research Network (HIRN) seeks to develop cell-based strategies to target pancreatic islets and overcome two central problems in type 1 diabetes: to (1) provide immunoregulation that is targeted to islets and shuts down autoimmune destruction without broad immune-suppression, and (2) deliver factors that improve ?-cell survival, regeneration and function. Advances in genetic modification of T lymphocytes have revolutionized therapeutic targeting in fields like oncology. T cells can be engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that direct CAR T-cells to specific antigens expressed by neoplastic cells whereupon they activate and cause tumor regression and elimination. These successes have prompted exploration of CAR technology with Tregulatory (Treg) cells the non-neoplastic disease settings, including type 1 diabetes. While those studies demonstrated safety, Treg cells ? which have the ability both to immunomodulate and deliver trophic factors supporting islet cell function, growth, regeneration and survival ? did not localize to sites where they may be needed (like islets or pancreas). This proposal is based on recent discoveries by our team that mouse Treg cells can be modified to express CAR's which bind modified antibodies to direct Treg localization to islets, and promote allograft tolerance in vivo. In addition our team members have generated and validated unique, high- quality monoclonal antibodies for purifying, investigating and targeting human islet cells. We hypothesize that human Treg cells can be modified to express chimeric antigen receptors that similarly target human islet cells. We postulate that developing these modular, cell-based targeting methods will produce novel clinical strategies to prevent T1D in high risk patients, to suppress autoimmunity and preserve ?-cell mass in patients with recent-onset T1D, and to deliver therapeutics to the pancreas for ?-cell expansion or regeneration in established T1D. In response to this RFA, we have formed a broad- based, complementary and interdisciplinary scientific team with expertise in human pancreatic islet biology, molecular targeting, immunotherapeutics, transplantation biology, and clinical trials. We propose three aims: 1) Develop antibody- directed CAR Treg cell targeting to human islets in vivo. 2) Develop strategies to enhance human islet targeting with split-receptor CAR Treg cells 3) Evaluate CAR Treg targeting to native pancreatic islets in mouse T1D models In addition, our team will bring to CTAR and HIRN substantial experience and new tools that could benefit the HIRN mission and its members.

"9370326","Currently there remain very limited treatment options for patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).  Pharmacodynamic biomarker genes, such as THBS1 and COMP, developed in our previous CORT project, have  proven valuable for assessing the efficacy of new therapies. Finding prognostic biomarkers is increasingly  important for deciding which patients to treat with toxic therapies. In addition, genes/proteins associated with  disease progression (prognostic biomarkers) likely drive disease. We have recently shown that COMP and  SPP1, and CTGF and SERPINE1 are markers of progressive SSc associated interstitial lung disease (ILD)and  skin disease, respectively. These genes are expressed by mesenchymal cells and are upregulated in vitro by  TGF?. Using single cell RNA-seq, in preliminary results we show transcriptome modules in healthy skin for  mesenchymal cells, including subsets of pericytes and fibroblasts, and SSc skin identified a distinct  transcriptome expressed uniquely on myofibroblasts. We propose that one or more of the mesenchymal cell  types in normal skin are progenitors of myofibroblasts in SSc skin. Genes in this myofibroblast transcriptome  include ADAM12, ITGA11, as well as biomarkers of SSc skin disease, such as THBS1, COMP, CTGF and  SERPINE1. Thus, biomarkers of progressive SSc skin disease are expressed mainly by myofibroblasts. ADAM12  and ITGA11, expressed on cells identified as myofibroblasts, likely regulate the phenotype of these cells, as  deletion of ITGA11 in mice markedly inhibits myofibroblast accumulation after wounding, and ADAM12 is a  marker of pericyte progenitors that in mice differentiate into myofibroblasts. Our preliminary data  support a singular hypothesis of this proposal that select biomarker genes drive differentiation  of a mesenchymal cell type that is responsible for fibrosis in SSc skin and lungs. We will take  advantage of unique resources developed in our laboratory to study thousands of single cell transcriptomes in  skin, combining this with the exceptional access to patients with early diffuse cutaneous SSc provided by the  UPMC Scleroderma Center. We propose three aims to evaluate this hypothesis. First, we will identify  biomarkers of progressive fibrosis in SSc skin and SSc-ILD. We will identify and validate prognostic skin  mRNA biomarkers of dcSSc skin disease and validate serum biomarkers identified using Somascan proteomic  technology of progressive SSc-ILD. Second, we will investigate single cell transcriptomes and the relationship  between dermal mesenchymal cells in normal and SSc skin. Further, we will compare quantitative and  qualitative changes of the transcriptomes of mesenchymal cells from patients with dcSSc to healthy controls  and identify profibrotic fibroblast and myofibroblast progenitors. Third, we will study the roles of TGF?,  ADAM12 and ITGA11 on regulating myofibroblast differentiation by testing the kinetics of TGF? on inducing  the myofibroblast transcriptome, by identifying myofibroblast progenitor cells, and by testing the effect of  inhibiting ADAM12 and ITGA11 on myofibroblast differentiation and transcriptome.

"9356666","Overall Abstract The overall goal of this SPORE in Myeloid Malignancies is to take advantage of our increased understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to develop novel, effective therapeutic strategies for patients with these treatment-resistant neoplasms. The extensive scientific and clinical resources at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) will be leveraged ? marshaling local expertise in cell and molecular biology, genetics, immunology, biostatistics, chemistry, murine models, and clinical trial development ? in order to perform innovative pre-clinical studies, to validate novel drug targets in patient cells, and to design and implement clinical trials that will eventually lead to improved outcomes for patients with myeloid malignancies. Each of the four Projects will promote detailed analysis of a promising new target by a combination of pre-clinical studies to optimize therapeutic development and early-stage clinical trials. Project 1 leverages recent exciting data from the laboratory of Dr. Scott Armstrong regarding the efficacy of targeting the MLL-menin interaction, which is essential for maintaining HOXA expression and maintenance of leukemia stem cells. Project 2 is based on the discovery by the Stegmaier laboratory that many cases of AML are dependent on SYK kinase activation, and that SYK activation causes chemotherapy resistance. Project 3 will examine the pre-clinical and clinical efficacy of a novel SF3B1 inhibitor, using an Sf3b1-mutant model developed by the Ebert laboratory, for the treatment MDS. Project 4 will examine the potential synergy of a highly effective vaccine with a potent immunologic checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of AML. The Cores have been designed to support all projects in translational research. The laboratory and clinical research components of each project will interface with Core 1 for statistical guidance in both experimental design and the interpretation of results. Core 2 will provide biospecimens banking for the samples produced by all projects in the course of clinical trials; these samples will be used for the generation of primagrafts in immunodeficient mice. Samples from the biospecimens bank as well as xenograft samples will, in turn, be available for use by the PI's of all projects. Core 3 will work with the clinical trials in each project for correlative studies. Ultimately, the proposed studies promise to improve the therapy of chemotherapy-resistant AML and splicing factor-mutant MDS, as well as developing an improved immunotherapeutic strategy for AML."
"9351485","ABSTRACT: In Bangladesh, as in other lower- and middle-income countries, the weak research infrastructure reduces the efficiency of research projects that are undertaken, as many Bangladeshi institutions do not have the complete set of skills (technical, statistical, management, methods, or community engagement skills) to undertake a successful research project and disseminate the results. Morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is growing in these countries, and there is growing evidence that country-specific research is needed to identify risk factors that are unique to the context of LMICs. With the resources of this RCRE grant, we would (1) identify institutions that already have expertise in research practice, and develop a formal framework that encourages the sharing of this expertise across institutions, increasing the efficiency of research by supporting a division of labor (2) increase the robustness of the identified existing expertise by research enhancement activities that allow the collaborators at the partner institutions to hone their skills and disseminate the results of their research and (3) use two pilot projects to engage the newly-formulated RCRE protocol, using the expertise of the RCRE?s shared core facilities and enhancing their research capacity. Collaborators at the University of Chicago have a long history of collaboration with institutions in Bangladesh, including a 15-year history of collaborating with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), the only full medical university in Bangladesh. With this local knowledge, the two lead institutions (UC and BSMMU), selected 6 additional regional research institutions to collaborate with. These six additional institutions will make up the shared core facilities of the RCRE, and will implement aspects of a research protocol that are relevant to their expertise. The shared core facilities are National Institute of Cancer Research & Hospital (NICRH), the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), University of Chicago Research Bangladesh (URB), Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), National Institute of Neurological Diseases (NIND), and the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB). In addition Directorate General of Health Services of Government of Bangladesh will also be a partner in this RCRE. Each of these institutions has a proven ability to excel in one of the five areas of research expertise we identified: clinical and diagnostics; data management, statistics, and informatics; biomarkers; population survey and data collection; and community engagement, outreach, and dissemination. After formally establishing this RCRE, we will implement two pilot research projects whose research topics reflect two key areas of NCD research: the establishment of a pathology-based cancer registry in the capital, Dhaka; and the relationship between the microbiome (which varies greatly between populations) and cardiovascular disease. Each of these pilot projects will be undertaken with the collaboration of the RCRE shared core facilities, and supported by workshops, short courses, and colloquium that have been developed to enhance the existing capacity of the RCRE members. This formal network of collaboration will strengthen the capacity of local researchers to investigate the determinants of NCD in local populations, and lead to better informed policies and care."

"9444234","Data Science Core-Abstract Achieving the scientific goals of the Overall Research Strategy requires a significant effort and advancement in data science for neuroscience. In particular, scientific progress depends on novel experimental design, data collection and processing (as described in Projects 1 and 2), and novel analysis and models (as described in Project 3), which lead to general principles to be tested (as described in Project 4). The fundamental goal of the Data Science Core is to accelerate the process connecting the raw data collected in Projects 1, 2, and 4 to the analyses used to obtain data derivatives, which can then be used to build models in Project 3, and extend them in Project 4. The two main challenges we face to accelerate these links are big data and reproducibility. First, the data collected are too large to fit into memory, or even on disk, with each experiment ordering on one terabyte (TB), and the entire dataset amassing hundreds of TB or more. Therefore, the classic paradigm of using MATLAB for all analyses that are stored locally is not sufficient. The solution to this is twofold: (1) build a cloud data management system, so that all consortium members can quickly access and analyze the data, and (2) build scalable algorithms, so that different individuals can apply them to these big data. The cloud data management system will be built on the infrastructure developed for the Open Connectome Project 1? ?, originally developed to host data on institutional resources. In the last year, the team has matured to become NeuroData (?http://neurodata.io?), porting all the infrastructure to the commercial cloud, and already hosting 20+ datasets comprising 50+ TB, including all three scales of analysis proposed here (h? ttp://neurodata.io?). The scalable algorithms will be based on another project from NeuroData called FlashX (?http://flashx.io?). FlashX is a C++ graph analytics and machine learning library, designed to run analytics on arbitrarily large data using only a single machine (not a cluster) 2? ,3?, and the recent recipient of a DARPA SBIR award to commercialize. We will use FlashX as a backend to support all the algorithms for processing behavior and imaging data. Second, this is a team effort, so sharing analyses and derivatives and keeping track of metadata will be important. The solution to this is to build a comprehensive scientific environment in the cloud, that enables sharing of entire ?digital experiments?, linking to the data and ensuring that the entire analysis pipeline can be trivially run and extended by anyone and anywhere.

"9450154","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   Despite reductions in combustible cigarette consumption rates, approximately 5.6 million American  children are expected to die prematurely from a smoking-related illness unless rates continue to decline.1 This  statistic is particularly staggering when considering that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are  increasing in popularity.2 Prospective studies identifying antecedents and consequences of ENDS use,  especially among underrepresented racial minority groups, are paramount. Furthermore, clarifying the negative  health effects of ENDS use on the developing adolescent brain is critical. Targeting populations demonstrating  the highest rates of ENDS use, including Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American high school students, will  have the greatest impact on reducing mortality and morbidity from tobacco-related illness. This project's aims  are three-fold. First, we will identify risk and protective factors that predict the onset of ENDS among high-risk  adolescents without prior substance use, and whether or not they also predict cigarette onset. We will  characterize factors specific to ENDS (e.g., flavoring, perceptions of harm), as well as general factors associated  with substance use initiation including personality and social contexts. Second, given mixed findings on the role  of ENDS as a potential gateway drug, we will also determine whether ENDS-users are more likely to transition  to cigarettes, marijuana, and/or polysubstance use compared to non-users. ENDS specific factors, as well as  factors associated with substance use escalation, including psychopathology and nicotine dependence, will be  examined. Third, we will delineate neurobiological differences across adolescents having initiated ENDS use  with those that have not using magnetic resonance imaging. We will examine whether ENDS use, similar to  cigarette use, is linked with reduced cortical thickness in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and insula and altered  functional activity in the striatum during reward processing. We will also determine if similar brain alterations  precede use by scanning adolescents prior to nicotine exposure. This is important to delineate the  neurobiological trajectories that may place an adolescent onto a path for addiction. We will focus on  Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American high school students as ENDS use is highest among this group.3,4  Identifying risk and protective factors specific to this population will help avert tobacco use disparities.  Furthermore, although a majority of healthcare providers have heard of ENDS, most report knowing very little  about these products including potential negative health consequences. Empirical evidence regarding the onset,  potential transitions, and negative consequences on the brain of ENDS use is critical to help clinicians improve  prevention programming and assist policy makers in deciding how to continue regulating these products. By  identifying key modifiable targets, this work will help healthcare professionals improve routine screenings,  substance use counseling, and preventive interventions."
"9444174","Abstract Even a simple movement, like the extension or flexion of a forelimb, requires the activation requires the input of activity from many different neural populations across different brain areas onto motor control centers that control muscle activity. Although many brain areas have been shown to have motor related activity, and to be involved in movement preparation and execution, the relation between activity in these brain areas and the output of the brain onto the spinal cord remain elusive. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to characterize the contribution of upstream neural populations from other cortical and subcortical areas to the activity of the projection-specific populations of corticospinal neurons characterized in Project 1, during different modes of motor control. We propose to perform this characterization using a range of functional imaging approaches that interrogate this problem at different scales. We will utilize wide-field optical mapping (WFOM) to image, in an unbiased manner, the activity hundreds to thousands of cells across many cortical areas in relation to the activity of particular CSNs, which represent the output of the cortex to the spinal cord. Informed by the WFOM imaging, we will then perform simultaneous imaging of populations of neurons, with single cell resolution, in different brain areas using 2-photon random access mesoscopic (2p-RAM) imaging. Finally, we propose to use the 2pRAM mesoscope to simultaneously image the activity of thalamus or striatum through GRIN lenses, and the activity of corticospinal neurons, during particular motor control modes. The knowledge gained in this project will be critical to understand principles governing activity in motor cortex versus other cortical areas in relation to motor output as proposed in project 3, as well as to inform the modelling in project 4. Furthermore, it will help generate predictions that will be tested using closed-loop optogenetic manipulation experiments in project 5."
"9314536","SUMMARY The metabolomics core laboratory at the Duke Stedman Center deploys both targeted and non-targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolic profiling to provide a rare combination of broad coverage and analytical precision. The Duke team has been a leader in applying targeted MS-based metabolic profiling for understanding of disease and biological mechanisms. The role of the core in the current application will be to perform both targeted and non-targeted metabolomics assays on samples generated by Dr. Gordon in Project 1, and Drs. Heath and Klein in Project 2; in both instances this work continues previously established and productive collaborations between our groups. In the context of Project 1, Core A will measure metabolites produced by microbial communities taken from obese and lean twin pairs and transplanted into germ-free mice, and will also provide metabolomic profiles of serum, urine and tissues of the host animals. In the context of Project 2, Core A will provide metabolomic profiles of twin pairs with discordance for obesity that are further sub-divided into metabolically well and unwell subgroups. Obtaining metabolic profiles of the human subjects in collaboration with Project 2 provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of gut microbiota from those subjects on metabolism when transplanted into mice via Project 1. We hypothesize that disease-related metabolic signatures will be transmitted to germ-free mice by transplantation of microbial communities from obese and metabolically unhealthy subjects. Metabolic profiles of serum, urine and tissues will include targeted MS/MS and GC/MS-based assays of approximately 220 metabolites across 8 classes or modules of analytes that represent byproducts of core metabolic pathways. These analyses will be supplemented by non-targeted GC/MS-based analyses of a broader array of metabolites, including some unique to microbial metabolic pathways."
"9410312","Abstract The goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative imaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an incidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical tumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to 50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere few months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for guiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with ionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions smaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target tumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal metastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to reduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual contrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis tumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano?s approach of targeting tumor acidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with OncoNano?s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to image the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary Data: We have demonstrated that OncoNano?s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety of solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision in SCID mouse models. OncoNano?s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered clear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG imaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%) survival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery. Specific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the ultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible manufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND filing. The specific aims in the SBIR Phase I, addresses the nanoprobe stability requirement, and addresses the nanoprobe sensitivity and specificity requirement in in-vivo models. The specific aims in Phase 2 of the project addresses the critical milestones on the path to clinical translation including- the scale-up requirement to meet the GLP and human testing needs, a demonstration of product safety in GLP in-vivo studies, culminating in an IND filing with the FDA."

This goal requires a rich array of readily-deployable and flexible/adaptable  psoriasis-relevant and innovative in vivo systems that permit testing of a wide range of novel concepts, roles of  specific mediator/pathways, and efficacies of specific repurposed and anti-psoriasis drugs. The PMC will meet  this need, by working closely with the AMC and CRP to provide all needed transgenic and psoriasiform mouse  models and isolated tissues, blood and cells for analyses and bioinformatic-derived biomarker and target  generation. The PMC will enable generation and testing by the CRP of hypotheses generated as a result of  human and mouse bioinformatics data. The goals of the PMC include providing enabling materials, technology  and expertise in psoriasis mouse models and mouse molecular genetics that will allow and enhance successful  completion of the CRP Aims and Objectives. To support the CRP?s objectives, the PMC will: A. Provide  genetically modified existing mouse models of psoriasiform skin inflammation; B. Engineer new innovative  genetic mouse models based upon novel genes/proteins identified by the AMC; C. Provide primary cells  isolated from genetically manipulated mice for ex vivo hypothesis testing; D. Identify the most appropriate  psoriasis mouse model(s) to test efficacy of pathway-specific drugs identified by the AMC, and generate and  provide mice to the CRP for preclinical testing and evaluation; and E. Generate germ-free mice and re-  introduce bacteriome/mycobiome species identified by the AMC and provide animals to the CRP for analysis  and hypothesis testing. The PMC will also provide reiterative data generation for additional ?omics? data  analyses and identification by the AMC of novel pathways, biomarkers, micro/mycobiome species, and cellular  mediators, contributing new insight into psoriasis pathogenesis, enabling validation in clinical psoriasis patient  samples. The PMC provides a coordinated center of excellence enabling the creation of new, and utilization of  existing, animal models of psoriasis to better test the cellular and molecular mechanisms hypothesized to  mediate psoriasis.

"9409280","This project will explore the translational potential of a new PET molecular imaging probe [68Ga]PC-1001 for detecting very small cancers and distinguishing between localized and metastasized cancers in bone and soft tissue mouse models. [68Ga]PC-1001 will be evaluated for metastatic prostate (PC) and pancreatic (PaCa) cancers. Early detection of the most lethal PaCa with <5% survival for 5 years could improve patient survival by earlier intervention, currently an unmet clinical challenge. Bone metastases, the hallmark of advanced PC, occurring in ~80?90% of cases. Bone is a common metastatic site in a variety of other cancers including breast, prostate and lung, triggering severe bone pain, fracture, malignant hypercalcemia, infection and skeletal complications. Soft tissue metastases to liver, lung, and/or brain are indicators of poor prognosis and ultimately cause death for both PC and PaCa. Since no cancer cell specific positron emission tomography (PET) probe is available clinically, our goal is to develop a sensitive PET probe that can detect the smallest sizes of PaCa tumor metastasis and differentiate bone from soft tissue PC metastasis in mice. In preparation for the resubmission of this proposal, we successfully achieved the goals of detecting very small PaCa tumors (< 2 mm3) in KPC transgenic mice, and distinguishing PC tumor from neighboring bone tissues in a mouse model of human PC bone metastasis. With encouraging new data, we propose to: 1) compare the imaging profile of [68Ga]PC-1001/PET with [18F]FDG/PET in localized and metastatic PaCa using an immune-intact KPC transgenic mouse model; 2) detect PC bone metastasis by distinguishing between clusters of human cancer tissues in bone and the surrounding reactive mouse bone tissues in immune-deficient mice. Both models have been thoroughly established in our lab for observing localized tumor growth and soft tissue metastases (PaCa model) and cancer bone and soft tissue metastasis using ex vivo luciferase-tagged cells as experimental tools (PC model). The specificity of [68Ga]PC-1001 to cancer cells and their metastases to bone and soft tissues will be confirmed at the cellular level. The sensitivity of [68Ga]PC-1001/PET will then be compared with [18F]FDG/PET for cancer bone and soft tissue metastases in PaCa and PC models. The combined expertise of Dr. Pan's lab at the University of Virginia in chemical synthesis, molecular imaging and autoradiography, and Dr. Chung's lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in a PaCa KPC and MiaPaCa models of local tumor growth and distant dissemination to surrounding tissues and in PC models of bone and soft tissue metastases ensure the likely success of the project. We anticipate that at the end of this phase I project [68Ga]PC-1001 will be ready for preclinical toxicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies.

The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Zero Suicide plus a cultural component (ZS+) (experimental group) compared to Zero Suicide (ZS) alone (control group) on suicidal ideation, behaviors, and resiliency in a randomized control trial of 138 AI youth ages 12-24 at two rural IHS clinics on the Pueblo of San Felipe. The long-term goal of this study is to determine which is more effective at reducing suicidal ideation and behaviors and increasing resiliency, ZS+ or ZS alone. Year 1 will focus on training providers on the Zero Suicide model and manualizing the Katishtya Intergenerational Culture Knowledge Seminars (KICKS) curriculum that was piloted and positively evaluated over the past three summers as a cultural module to improve the adoption and acceptability of Zero Suicide. Years 2-4 will focus on participant recruitment, assignment to experimental and control groups, and implementation. Year 5 will focus on data analysis and dissemination. Data will be collected from all experimental and control group participants at 4 time points: baseline, 12-weeks, 6-months and 9-months to explore the effects of the intervention over time. The central hypothesis is that ZS+ will be more effective then ZS alone. We propose three aims: (1) Specific Aim 1: Using Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR), partner with tribal stakeholders and researchers to formally manualize the KICKS cultural module for Zero Suicide (ZS+); (2) Specific Aim 2: To determine if adding a cultural component to the Zero Suicide model is more effective at reducing risk factors and increasing resiliency in AI youth than Zero Suicide alone; and (3) Specific Aim 3: Determine the essential features of the KICKS module for adaptation by other tribes and disseminate the model."

"9565804","PD/PI: Takemaru, Ken-Ichi Title: Chibby and Its Associated Proteins in Ciliated Cell Differentiation PROJECT SUMMARY  Motile multicilia are abundant in the respiratory tract and beat synchronously in waves to propel inhaled debris and pathogens entrapped in mucus to the pharynx. This provides an important innate defense mechanism against respiratory infections. Multicilia are usually found as clusters of 100 to 300 on the apical surface of a ciliated cell in the respiratory epithelium. Dysfunction of multicilia has been linked to various pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Despite their clinical importance, little is known about the key molecules and mechanisms that govern multiciliogenesis and ciliated cell differentiation. Therefore, understanding these fundamental biological phenomena is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of cilia-related pulmonary disorders. We previously demonstrated that the small coiled-coil protein Chibby (Cby) localizes to the basal body (BB) of cilia and plays an essential role in ciliogenesis and differentiation of airway ciliated cells in mice. More recently, we reported that during early stages of ciliated cell differentiation, Cby facilitates efficient docking of BBs to the apical cell membrane via formation of membranous structures, called ciliary vesicles (CVs). Mechanistically, Cby is recruited to the BBs through protein-protein interactions with the ciliopathy-associated protein CEP164. Cby then interacts with the membrane trafficking machinery component Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rab8, to promote recruitment of Rab8 and CV assembly. Cby may also play a role in biogenesis and homeostasis of the ciliary membrane (CM) as it continues to localize at the base of elongating and mature cilia. However, the molecular components and mechanisms of assembly of CVs and CMs and BB docking remain poorly understood. For this competing R01 renewal proposal, we have established a conditional CEP164-KO mouse model to study its function during ciliated cell differentiation in vivo. Furthermore, we have successfully identified bona fide Cby-interacting proteins, named FAM92A and FAM92B, which harbor a putative membrane-binding Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain. We propose to investigate their molecular roles in differentiation of airway ciliated cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the roles of Cby, CEP164, and FAM92 proteins in CV formation, BB docking, and ciliated cell differentiation with the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Investigate the role of CEP164 in ciliated cell differentiation; Specific Aim 2. Study the roles of FAM92A and FAM92B in ciliogenesis and ciliated cell differentiation; Specific Aim 3. Elucidate the membrane-binding and curving properties of FAM92A, FAM92B, and Cby. We anticipate that these experiments will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ciliogenesis and ciliated cell differentiation. "
"9436544","PROJECT SUMMARY Attention is the remarkable ability of animals to select and preferentially process the most important, or ?highest priority?, information in complex environments to guide behavior. This dynamic ability is essential for a range of cognitive functions and adaptive behavior, and its dysfunction is found in diverse psychiatric illnesses including ADHD, autism and schizophrenia. Yet, almost nothing is known about the circuit mechanisms by which the brain implements the selection of the highest priority stimulus at any instant. One key factor that has slowed progress has been the nearly exclusive use of primates for the study of attention: the absence of diverse genetic tools for use in primates has precluded the systematic dissection of cell-type specific contributions and neural computations in cortical and subcortical circuits in service of attention control. Another is that rigorous behavioral paradigms to study attention do not currently exist in any other (genetically tractable) mammalian species. To bridge this gap, we propose an innovate alternate approach: to develop parameterized, primate-like behavioral paradigms for visuospatial attention in the mouse so that the full power of genetic techniques offered by the mouse model can be brought to bear to dissect the neural circuitry underlying attention control. Here, we will develop touchscreen-based tasks in freely behaving mice for studying attention. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop three parameterized tasks for studying exogenous (bottom-up) control of spatial attention, namely, a Posner discrimination task, a flanker task, and a Posner-cued selection task. In Aim 2, we will develop two parameterized tasks for studying endogenous (top-down) control of spatial attention, namely, a spatial expectation task and a top-down spatially-cued selection task. Additionally, in Aim 3, we will use head and eye-trackers to develop a closed-loop stimulus presentation system that adjusts, in real time, stimulus locations with respect to the gaze direction of the freely behaving mouse. This will permit consistent retinotopic presentation of stimuli across trials in the above tasks, a requirement for future experiments into the functional signatures as well as causal roles of neural circuits in spatial attention control. Preliminary behavioral data support the feasibility of all three proposed aims. This development, for the first time, of rigorous paradigms for spatial attention in a genetically tractable mammalian model will establish a powerful new platform for future work unraveling neural mechanisms of attention control, as well as of neural information processing pathways that are disrupted in attentional dysfunction."
"9485706","PROJECT SUMMARY While there is a high prevalence for the co-occurrence of alcohol use disorders (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the mechanisms underlying these disorders are not fully understood. Further, few treatments are effective for those suffering with PTSD-AUD comorbidity. Animal models that closely mimic the key clinical features of these disorders are critical for elucidating mechanisms and factors that underlie the co-occurrence of these illnesses and facilitate development of new and more effective therapeutics. We have recently conducted a series of pilot studies with the goal of developing such a model. Specifically, we have demonstrated that chronic predator odor (TMT) exposure sensitizes male and female mice to later acute stress (TMT)-induced reinstatement of alcohol relapse-like behavior. This effect is long lasting (>60 days) and the sensitized effect generalizes to exposure to context cues associated with prior chronic TMT exposure. We have also demonstrated that a novel model of chronic early-life stress (CES) has long-lasting effects on anxiety behavior and stress responsiveness, as well as increased stress-related alcohol consumption. Finally, our pilot work shows that chronic TMT exposure produces long-last alterations in oxytocin (OT) expression in hypothalamus (PVN) as well as oxytocin receptor mRNA expression in stress-relevant projection brain regions (central amygdala; CeA, bed nucleus of stria terminalis; BNST). Further, systemic administration of OT blocked stress (TMT)-induced alcohol relapse in mice with and without a history of chronic stress exposure. Proposed studies in this application are designed to build on and expand these compelling and supportive pilot findings. The overall objective of this proposal is to optimize and further characterize our model of PTSD that captures many key clinical features of the disorder, link consequences of the model to alcohol self- administration and relapse behavior, and examine the role of the neurohormone oxytocin in this mouse model of PTSD-AUD comorbidity. Specifically, after more fully characterizing the chronic predator odor (TMT) model, we will examine whether CES similarly sensitizes mice to stress-induced alcohol relapse and then use these procedures in combination to examine whether CES experience further augments the ability of chronic TMT exposure to subsequently sensitize mice to acute stress challenge provoking alcohol relapse-like behavior. This unique mouse model of PTSD-AUD will then be used to probe involvement of the oxytocin system, with studies also examining the capacity of exogenous OT treatment to block and/or prevent sensitized stress-induced alcohol relapse in the CES-TMT model. The overall goal is to establish and utilize a clinically relevant mouse model of PTSD-AUD that will advance our understanding of these co- occurring disorders and facilitate development of more effective treatments for PTSD-AUD comorbidity."
"9447055","CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor (CKR) that plays a central role in inflammation through its regulation of T cell migration and function. Despite the established clinical relevance of CXCR3 in atherosclerosis, cancer metastasis and inflammatory bowel disease, there are no FDA-approved drugs that target this receptor. Indeed, there are only two FDA approved drugs that target the entire CKR family, which consists of twenty receptors that regulate nearly every aspect of inflammation. Reasons for the difficulty in drug development at CKRs include the potential redundancy between multiple cognate chemokine ligands for each CKR and a lack of knowledge regarding how they regulate immune cell function. Thus, despite their central role in a variety of disease states, there is a critical unmet need for drugs targeting CKRs. This puts into context recent results from my group in which we have discovered that the cognate ligands of CXCR3, CXCL9, 10 and 11, do not simply act as agonists or antagonists at the receptor, but generate both quantitatively and qualitatively distinct signals. This is a physiologically relevant example of ?biased agonism?, a pharmacologic characteristic of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, in which different ligands for the same receptor induce distinct receptor conformations that impact their interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins or ?-arrestin (?arr) adapter proteins, resulting in different biological outputs. Our findings suggest that it will be possible to exploit biased agonism at CXCR3 as a means to develop new classes of drugs that target disease-relevant signaling pathways while minimizing off-target effects. In our preliminary studies, we have identified small molecules that differentially activate G proteins and ?arrs and generate distinct ?arr conformations at CXCR3. It was also determined that these biased agonists (a) differentially activate kinases and transcriptional pathways; and (b) have distinct effects in a mouse model of inflammatory skin disease, findings that are consistent with the hypothesis that G proteins and ?arrs differentially contribute to the CXCR3-mediated inflammatory response. The long-term goal of our research is to develop novel biased agonists targeting CKR signaling. The overall objective of the studies outlined in this application, therefore, is to identify the contributions of G protein- and ?arr-mediated signaling to CXCR3-mediated inflammatory responses. Our central hypothesis is that these parallel pathways differentially contribute to the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate T cell function and inflammation. We plan to test our hypothesis and accomplish the objectives of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Use G protein- and ?arr-biased CXCR3 endogenous and small molecule agonists to identify determinants of bias at CXCR3; (2) Identify signaling pathways regulated by ?arrs and G proteins downstream of CXCR3; and (3) Determine how G protein- or ?arr-mediated signaling underlies CXCR3-mediated inflammation. This project explores an innovative approach to target CXCR3 signaling to aid in the development of a novel class of molecules with significant therapeutic potential."
"9566458","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings."
"9454624","Coordinating two arms for function PROJECT SUMMARY: Inability to use the weaker arm in functional activities accounts for over 50% of reduction in the quality of life after stroke. Most functional activities of daily living involve a coordinated use of both hands to accomplish different task goals. Despite the prevalence of bimanual actions in daily life, much of post-stroke arm rehabilitation research is focused on the assessment and treatment of the weaker arm, with little focus on how bimanual actions are affected. An underlying assumption, that has not been tested rigorously, is that unimanual performance deficits primarily account for impairments in coordination of bimanual actions. While deficits in the arm contralateral to stroke are discernible, critical motor control deficits in the ipsilateral arm have also been reported. In addition, many task goals require higher-order motor plans that engage interhemispheric connections to control spatiotemporal interaction between the two arms. Further, there are multitude of ways in which two hands interact in time and space to accomplish different tasks, leading to distinct classes of bimanual coordination. Our long-term goal is to identify the motor, cognitive and neural contributors to bimanual actions in patients with stroke so that treatment strategies can be focused on the most crucial determinants. The proposed study will determine the relative impairments in different classes of bimanual actions after stroke and the degree to which the unimanual performance deficits predict bimanual impairment. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) identify abnormalities in bimanual coordination in patients with stroke for distinct classes of functional tasks compared to age-matched controls, (2) determine the relationship of sensorimotor deficits and unimanual performance of the paretic hand with bimanual coordination measures in patients with stroke. The approach is particularly innovative because we use combined kinematic and kinetic data to determine how control and coordination of distinct classes of bimanual actions is affected. We hypothesize that patients with stroke will demonstrate task-dependent impairments in coordinating their two arms compared to control participants. Further, unimanual performance deficits may predict coordination insufficiencies for classes of bimanual actions that involve each hand pursuing an independent goal than those that involve both hands contributing to a common goal. The proposed project is significant in that it provides an important first step in determining the contribution of unimanual impairments in bimanual coordination during distinct classes of bilateral actions. For those class of bimanual actions in which unimanual performance deficits significantly account for bimanual coordination deficits, future experiments will determine the effects of intense unimanual practice on bimanual coordination. If we observe that unimanual impairments do not predict coordination in certain class of bimanual actions, future research will focus on determining the cognitive, perceptual and neural factors that determine bimanual coordination for these actions."
"9484897","PROJECT SUMMARY  Among all racial/ethnic groups, African Americans (AAs) exhibit the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence  and mortality, for reasons that remain poorly understood. The gut microbiome is emerging as a significant  contributor to host health and disease. How social determinants interacting with individual factors  influence the gut microbiome may be key to understanding racial/ethnic variation in CRC.  This study will  establish if exposure to  structural violence increases psychosocial and physical vulnerability (e.g.,  anxiety/stress), compounded by one's behavior (e.g., diet), which interacts with the gut microbiome in ways  that result in CRC health inequality in urban AAs. Structural violence refers to the multiple ways in which social,  economic, and political systems expose particular populations to risks and vulnerabilities leading to increased  morbidity and mortality. AAs are more likely to live in urban poverty areas that are fraught with structural  violence. Chronic exposure to these societal pressures can elicit adverse neuroendocrine and immune  responses that alter the gut microbiome. In Aim 1, we will leverage our ongoing trial of 200 urban AA and non-  Hispanic white (NHW) adults (R01 CA204808) at high and low risk for CRC to evaluate: exposure to structural  violence at the community and individual level; psychosocial and physical health, dietary behavior,  neuroendocrine and immune markers, and colonic mucosa inflammation. From stool and mucosa, gut  microbial taxonomic structure, abundance of targeted microbes and their functional genes, shotgun  metagenomics, and targeted stool microbial metabolites will be determined. We will ascertain: (1) if the  distribution of these exposures and microbial markers differ between AAs and NHWs; (2) if the level of  exposure to structural violence is associated with the stool and colonic mucosa microbiomes and stool  metabolites; and (3) if exposure to structural violence, microbial data, neuroendocrine/immune markers, and  individual diet/health are predictive of colonic inflammation and adenoma using advanced computing  approaches. In Aim 2, using a mouse model of APC-driven colon polyps, we will mimic under controlled  conditions the type of diet and stress from structural violence observed in urban AA communities. Mice will be  exposed to one of three diets (low animal protein/low saturated fat, high animal protein/low saturated fat, or  high animal protein/high saturated fat), with or without exposure to episodic aggression (mimicking structural  violence). Frequency, size, and severity of colon polyps, abundance of targeted gut microbes and their  functional genes, neuroendocrine/immune markers, and colonic inflammation will be assessed and  correlated to each animal cohort.  The success of this research is supported by a multidisciplinary team of  scientists with expertise in microbiology, social science, CRC mouse models, gastroenterology, bioinformatics,  and nutrition. Because the gut microbiome can be reshaped by diet and other factors, gaining an  understanding of the complex interaction of social determinants, behavior, and biology on the gut microbiome  has promise to lead to novel strategies to reduce racial disparities in CRC."
"9419235","ABSTRACT Americans of Hispanic and African heritage are at higher risk to develop molecular subtypes of breast cancer that associate with poor prognosis, including triple-negative (ER-PR-Her2-) and Her2+ breast cancers relative to Non-Hispanic whites. Increased chromosome instability (CI) in most cancers correlates with poor clinical outcomes and higher levels of CI is observed in poor-prognosis HR- breast cancers relative to luminal subtypes. Centrosome amplification, or the accumulation of 3 or more centrosomes within a cell, and defective mitosis are two principal drivers of chromosome instability. Centrosome amplification correlates with invasion, metastasis, poor clinical outcomes, and HR- subtypes. Interestingly, we identified TTK and TBK1 kinases as regulators of centrosome amplification in cancer cells. TTK and TBK1 are centrosome/mitotic regulators, and reports indicate TBK1 can regulate mitotic progression directly, and indirectly through phosphorylation of Plk1, which phosphorylates TTK to modulate the spindle assembly checkpoint. Our preliminary data show that these two mitotic kinases can significantly influence epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), an activity never described for mitotic kinases. Silencing of TTK reduces phosphorylation of SMAD3 upon TGF- stimulation, suppressing regulators of EMT. In a similar fashion, recent studies from the Chellappan lab identified TBK1 physically interacts with the E2F1 transcription factor, which induces the expression of TTK, and EMT genes like vimentin, fibronectin, ZEB-1, and ZEB2. Further, depletion of TBK1 could significantly reduce the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, suggesting that kinases involved in mitosis like TTK and TBK1 can contribute significantly to the EMT and metastasis of tumors. Chemical inhibition of TTK and TBK1 reduced levels of EMT regulators (Slug, SNAIL), as well as important regulators of the centrosome cycle and mitosis (p-H3, cyclin B, Aurora kinase A). Since inhibitors are available for TTK and TBK1, it would be feasible to target these kinases to combat HR- breast cancers. We hypothesize that elevated levels and activity of TTK and TBK1 enhance tumor growth, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, and that such events correlate with prognostic molecular subtypes and survival outcomes of H/L breast cancer patients from Puerto Rico. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: 1. To establish if TTK and TBK1 contribute to poor prognosis molecular subtypes and surrogate markers of survival in Hispanics/Latinos. 2. To determine how TTK and TBK1 drive the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and promote invasion. 3. To determine how TTK and TBK1 impact tumor growth and metastasis. Data resulting from the proposed experiments will allow the identification of pathways influenced by mitotic regulators in breast cancer cells driving invasion and metastasis, and will provide potential prognostic markers for high-risk breast tumors in Hispanics/Latinos."
"9352328","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive disease, often leading to loss of exocrine and endocrine function and debilitating abdominal pain. It is unknown why some individuals progress and develop complications, including pancreatogenic diabetes (PDM) and/or pancreas cancer (PDAC). In this consortium, investigators propose to conduct well-powered studies of risk factors, environmental influences, and proof-of-concept studies to move the field forward, particularly those factors that increase the risk of PDM and PDAC. We propose the following specific aims (SA) to meet the goals of RFA-DK-14-027. SA #1: To define the natural history of pediatric and adult patients with an established diagnosis of CP or acute recurrent pancreatitis, we propose a prospective observational cohort study. We will place emphasis on identifying risk factors and phenotypes for those patients who develop PDM and/or PDAC. Biological specimens will be obtained to facilitate the study of possible biomarkers which might facilitate early disease diagnosis and management. SA #2: The pathogenesis of PDM and the interactions of non-endocrine pancreatic disease with islet dysfunction are not well understood. We will use measurements of islet function (oral glucose tolerance tests, arginine- augmented hyperglycemic clamps) in cross-sectional and prospective studies to define the prevalence and physiologic basis for metabolic dysregulation and diabetes in CP. We will also prospectively ascertain changes in islet function and transition to overt PDM, and correlate changes in metabolic status with changes in pancreatic inflammation and function. SA #3: To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging in the non-invasive evaluation of suspected early CP, we propose a prospective study comparing CP patients to a control population with normal pancreatic exocrine function. A reduced T1-weighted MR signal, reduced diffusion and decreased duodenal fluid volume in response to secretin stimulation may suggest CP. SA #4: Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a carbohydrate-binding protein which appears to be involved in fibrogenesis and tissue remodeling in CP. A Gal-3 inhibitor appears to be safe and shows potential for reducing organ fibrosis in humans. To determine the safety and efficacy of a Gal-3 inhibitor, we propose a randomized placebo- controlled trial in 66 CP patients. Improvement in post-therapy duodenal fluid bicarbonate level will be the primary efficacy endpoint. We anticipate that this drug will reverse fibrosis, as manifested by improvement in duodenal bicarbonate level. Additional endpoints including MRI/MRCP appearance, Gal-3 level, quality of life, abdominal pain scores and ?-cell function will also be assessed."
"9520762","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): TGF?s and other structurally related proteins of the TGF? superfamily, such as BMPs, GDFs, and activins, are secreted signaling proteins that regulate many essential processes, ranging from establishment of the body plan during embryogenesis to regulation of the adaptive immune system. The importance of the more than 30 superfamily members is demonstrated by the many human diseases that result from dysregulation of the pathway, including skeletal and cardiac disorders, infertility, and cancer. The development of effective therapies for treating pathway-associated diseases requires knowledge of the interactions that govern ligand activities - this includes interactions with the signaling receptors, but as well with the many accessory proteins that bind ligands and regulate ligand accessibility. The objective of this project is to capitalize upon our current understanding of how TGF?s bind their signaling receptors to investigate how betaglycan, a membrane-anchored accessory binding proteolgycan, functions on the one hand to promote TGF? signaling, and on the other to inhibit activin signaling. The potentiation of TGF? signaling by betaglycan is thought to arise from its ability to bind and localize TGF? ligands on the cell surface. To investigate this, we will determine the structures of betaglycan's two independent TGF? binding domains, BGE and BGU, bound to TGF? using crystallography, which is ideal for these purposes, as BGE and BGU bind and form highly stable complexes with TGF?. The mechanisms for potentiation of receptor binding suggested by the structure of the complexes will be tested in functional assays. The inhibition of activin signaling by betaglycan is thought t be mediated by sequestration of the activin type II receptor, ActRII or the close homolog ActRIIb, in a ternary complex with betaglycan and inhibin A, a heterodimeric ligand with an activin ? subunit that binds the activin type II receptor, ActRII/ActRIIb, and an activin ? subunit that binds BGU, betaglycan's C-terminal binding domain. To investigate this, we will first determine how activins bind their type I receptor, ActRIb. These studies will be carried out using NMR as ActRIb binds activin A weakly. This will be further investigated by determining the structure of inhibin A bound to BGU using crystallography, which is ideal for these purposes as BGU binds and forms a highly stable complex with inhibin A. The mechanisms for antagonism of activin by inhibin A suggested by the structure of the complexes will be tested in functional assays. The feasibility of the proposed studies is demonstrated by diffracting crystals obtained for the BGE:T?RII:TGF? complex, the ability to isolate the BGUC:TGF? complex, and NMR signal assignments for ActRIb. The determination of these structures will provide an important missing link in our understanding of how one of the accessory proteins of the superfamily, betaglycan, influences downstream signaling induced by TGF?s and activin. The structures will also aid in the development of novel targeted-therapies for treatment of diseases and disorders, such as cancer and infertility, caused by aberrant TGF? and activin signaling."
"9436471","Background: Transgender adults (?trans persons?) comprise 0.6% of the United States population. The few studies that have characterized the care received by trans persons have used relatively small and non- representative samples. There is a need to know more about the care that trans persons currently receive, as a basis for improving this care in the future. Approach: We will use a database containing approximately 160 million people, which is broadly representative of commercially insured people in the United States. In our pilot analyses, we identified 9,632 trans persons in this database, based solely upon diagnosis codes for gender dysphoria. Our project will have three aims. First, we will use a more comprehensive approach to identify trans persons in the dataset, including additional diagnosis codes, procedure codes, prescription fills, and inconsistencies in the gender variable. Second, having identified a population of trans persons, we will characterize the care they receive. We have identified four prominent clinical practice guidelines for trans care. Using these guidelines, we will identify important aspects of transgender care that are amenable to being characterized using a large database. As an example, we will characterize the adequacy of laboratory monitoring in patients receiving transgender hormone therapy. We have already identified at least fourteen aspects of care to study. In finalizing our list of analyses, and operationalizing how we will analyze them, we will be advised by a panel of clinical experts. For each analysis, we will define a denominator, or a group of patients eligible to receive that care element, and a numerator, a subset of the denominator who did receive it. We will calculate the proportion of patients who received each care element, and examine differences between subgroups (e.g., male vs. female gender identity, age, race). Third, we will convene a panel of seven clinical experts in trans care, as well as three trans patients. Using our results, this technical expert panel (TEP) will help advise us regarding which analyses would be potentially suitable to serve as a basis for developing quality of care metrics for trans patients. TEP members will be asked to comment on four aspects of potential quality measures: 1) importance; 2) reliability and validity; 3) ease of understanding; and 4) feasibility of collection and calculation. Anticipated Impacts: This study will constitute the largest study to characterize the care delivered to trans persons to date, and the results will be generalizable to the US population of commercially insured individuals. The methods we develop to identify trans persons in a large, automated database will serve as a basis for future studies by our group and by others. In addition to providing a baseline for the quality of care delivered to trans persons today, our results and the input from our TEP will provide a basis for the future development of quality measures for trans care. The existence of such quality measures has the potential to facilitate quality improvement over time."
"9453189","ABSTRACT  Scientific Premise. One million homeless youth smoke --70% of the population. Not only do homeless youth smoke at a rate 2.5 times higher than other youth populations, they engage in riskier smoking practices. Many homeless youth want to stop smoking, but most who attempt to quit do so without supported intervention. No known study has focused on smoking cessation effectiveness with homeless youth?a notable public health oversight. As the NCI Tobacco Control Research Priorities working group has noted, there have been few scientific advances in tobacco treatment in the past 20 years. Moreover, disparities in tobacco use between privileged and vulnerable populations have increased due to differential rates in access and treatment response to existent tobacco cessation intervention.  Training Plan. Through this K07 career development grant, Dr. Nemeth will receive direct training in addiction and novel behavioral intervention science, and application of this knowledge to mentored research implementation, to optimize a contextually tailored cessation intervention for homeless youth. The mentoring team includes NIH-funded researchers with expertise in community-based intervention development for homeless youth and methodological approaches to the development of novel tobacco cessation strategies endorsed by the NCI. The overall training plan will equip Dr. Nemeth with skills to implement cessation intervention development studies with vulnerable youth populations using Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST) methodology.  Mentored Research. Specific Aim 1 will establish a theoretical framework for cessation among homeless youth incorporating phase-specific capabilities and opportunities impacting motivation to engage in cessation (MOST Step 1). Using qualitative and quantitative approaches, Specific Aim 1 will determine: (1) What internal capabilities and social and physical environmental opportunities need to be in place for homeless youth smokers to be motivated to quit and engage supported treatment (Aim 1a); (2) What conditions internal to homeless youth smokers, and in their social and physical environment, are associated with 1) motivation to quit and 2) past quit attempts? (Aim 1b). Guided by the theoretical framework for cessation among homeless youth, Specific Aim 2 will identify a set of cessation intervention components and assess their implementation feasibility (MOST Step 2). This aim will apply a theoretical framework for smoking cessation among homeless youth in order to: (1) identify a set of cessation intervention components to test for effect on abstinence in future study (Aim 2a); and (2) assess acceptability and feasibility of cessation component implementation among homeless youth smokers and among their service providers (Aim 2b). This work has strong potential to reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality caused by smoking among homeless youth.  Transition to Research Independence. This applied approach responds to a key scientific goal recommended by the NCI Tobacco Control Research Priorities working group that aims to increase access to, and the effectiveness of, behavioral health tobacco cessation treatment for high-risk populations. The training and mentored research plan will establish Dr. Nemeth as a tobacco control intervention scientist positioned to implement NIH-funded research in the optimization of multi-component behavioral interventions with highly traumatized and vulnerable youth populations."
"9348642","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) patients have increased fracture risk, have a higher risk of fracture-related mortality, and are difficult to treat due to CKD's metabolic complexity. Furthermore, standard practices for monitoring fracture risk (i.e. bone mineral density, BMD) have limitations in this patient population. Currently, treatment for CKD-MBD patients is primarily focused on suppressing elevated parathyroid hormone, as can be accomplished with a calcimimetic. Cinacalcet, an FDA approved calcimimetic, effectively reduces parathyroid hormone, slows bone turnover and increases bone mass, yet it only modestly reduces fracture risk. This suggests a defect in bone quality, not just bone loss, is contributing to CKD fragility, and this notion is supported by recent evidence of alterations in collagen cross-linking and matrix hydration in CKD bone. Preliminary data collected for this study found evidence of bone microdamage, another important factor of bone quality which is previously unstudied in CKD. Microdamage is known to interact with porosity, thus the combination of these issues may have significant impact on CKD fragility. In summary, normalizing fracture risk in these patients will likely require more than simply suppressing bone loss; the bone quality must also be treated. We hypothesize that the quality of CKD bone can be improved using a combination treatment of calcimimetic, to reduce parathyroid hormone and bone loss, and raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator drug for osteoporosis recently revealed to have direct positive effects on bone tissue quality. We will test this hypothesis using a slowly progressive model of CKD-MBD, the Cy/+ rat. This study will first quantify the extent of skeletal microdamage in the bones of 30 and 35-week old CKD rats in comparison to their normal, age-matched littermates. We expect CKD to cause progressively increasing accumulation of cortical porosity and microdamage, with interactions occurring between microcracks and porosity. Next, the ability of combination calcimimetic and raloxifene treatment to improve measures of bone quantity and quality will be tested. Cy/+ rats will be treated from 25 to 35 weeks of age with vehicle, raloxifene, calcimimetic, or both drugs. Primary outcomes will be determined by skeletal analyses (microdamage, histology, microCT, bone density, mechanical testing, and resistance to fatigue), though the treatments' effects on the biochemical and renal components of CKD-MBD will be assessed as well. We predict that raloxifene will improve the mechanical properties of bone by improving bone quality and reducing microdamage formation, while calcimimetic treatment will improve mechanical properties by increasing bone mass and reducing porosity. Combination therapy should exceed both single treatments by positively impacting both quality and mass. An understanding of the detrimental impact of CKD on bone quality is a crucial step in preventing fractures in these patients. This study provides an important step in achieving this goal by examining these changes and their potential corrections in a rat model with spontaneous and progressive development of CKD."
"9559765","Project Summary Abstract: Our capability to apply high-throughput molecular profiling technologies to increasingly large cohorts and sample sets is significantly expanding our understanding of human biology and complex disease. The Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project is creating a unique resource of genetic variation and gene expression across a wide range of human tissues. Upon completion this will include RNA sequence data from over 25,000 samples spanning 53 human tissues/organs and whole genome and exome sequence data from 960 donors. Additional data types not yet generated will include miRNA-seq, protein levels, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, and DNase I hypersensitive site data among others. The ability to easily access, interpret and integrate these large data sets by a wide range of users with varying needs and skills is becoming of critical importance to leverage the full utility of the data. The GTEx Portal (http://gtexportal.org/) is the most widely accessed resource for the GTEx project, hosting all unprotected data, analysis results and numerous visual exploration tools, and has been enthusiastically received by the scientific community. To maximize the impact of this resource, we plan to expand the portal to: host data currently in production and new data types still to be generated; present novel and integrative analyses of existing data, and data from external sources; and to develop and share flexible tools for data analysis, visualization and access. Aim 1. We will host and support all open-access GTEx data and analysis results, performing systematic re-analyses of the data with new methods to reflect the state-of-the-art in RNA-seq analysis. We will add all new data sets to the portal to include novel assays (e.g. mi-RNA-seq, protein, methylation assays, etc/), derived analysis results (e.g. trans-eQTLs, splice- QTLs, GWAS enrichment analyses, protein-QTLs, etc.), and RNA-seq data sets from external investigators. Aim 2. We will work closely with both small focus groups of tool developers and engage our large user-base to identify and prioritize new features for development to display and integrate between multiple data types, and collaborate with other large genomic resources (e.g. ENCODE, UCSC and ENSEMBL browsers) to enable better integration of data sources and to enhance the utility and accessibility of the GTEx resource. Aim 3. We will automate and share all analysis pipeline tools with the scientific community. To support a wide range of user access needs, we will develop an open-source API to provide comprehensive data access, and also improve visualization tools and user-driven data analyses on the portal. To maximize use of the resource, we will design and offer training videos and outreach workshops. "

These meetings bring together researchers and trainees at the cutting edge of myelin development, physiology, pathology and treatment. This meeting uniquely focuses on central and peripheral myelin and is timely given growing interest in myelin biology and human disease and major advances since the last meeting in Europe in 2016. These advances include: developmental origins of oligodendrocyte precursors in the human fetal brain; genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of myelin production; an enhanced understanding of neuronal signals triggering myelination; new technologies to study myelin; the definition of myelination changes during human adolescence and its relevance in psychiatric disorders; mechanisms of age-dependent deterioration of myelin in dementia and stroke; progress in treating multiple sclerosis, as well as regenerative strategies to restore myelin. These and other advances position the field to go beyond the molecular, cellular and structural studies covered in previous meetings to address key research gaps in our understanding of myelin function at various key developmental stages, how these manifest as human disease, and the development of biologic, small molecule, gene and cell-based therapeutic approaches that will comprise the ?therapies of the future.? The scientific program of the 14th GRC ?Myelin Through the Ages? covers evolution and functions of myelin in the child, adolescent and adult, as well as diseases affecting myelin formation and integrity at these stages . The meeting will bring together basic and clinical investigators from academia and industry?almost a quarter of which have never spoken at a Myelin GRC before. We included an equal proportion of senior leaders and trainees/early career scientists and we have prioritized diversity and gender balance among the roster of speakers. All participants will contribute an oral or poster presentation, which serve as key elements to promote productive interactions amongst participants. These and other GRC activities will stimulate and accelerate progress in the field of myelin biology and medicine. The 2018 format will begin with the ?Myelin GRS? building on the exceptional success of preceding meetings (2012-16). The GRS will provide a privileged venue for young investigators to interact, present their most current research and develop collaborations, as well as informal social activities. We expect more than 60 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the GRS and the GRC. We request funds to support travel and registration costs for invited PIs and trainees."
"9565806","Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a hallmark of asthma, consists of two features: heightened contraction of airway smooth muscle (ASM) upon exposure of non-specific stimuli, and ASM remodeling that reduces the effectiveness of bronchodilators. The cellular and molecular processes underlying these two undesirable changes in ASM, however, remain elusive. This project tests a hypothesis that the TMEM16A Ca2+-activated Cl- channel is a common effector underlying neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator-induced airway hypercontraction, accounting for the non-specific nature of AHR, and is also a key molecule mediating ASM remodeling, contributing to persistent AHR. This proposal has 3 Aims. Aim 1: Because Tmem16a systemic null mice die shortly after their birth, studying the role of this gene in ASM in adulthood has not been possible. To circumvent this challenge, we have generated a mouse line whose TMEM16A in smooth muscle can be deleted specifically. This new unique mouse line will be used to establish that TMEM16A is required for both Ca2+ spark (an endogenous localized Ca2+ signal for TMEM16A)-induced and neurotransmitter acetylcholine(Ach)-induced contraction in healthy adult mice, and is also necessary for Ach-induced hypercontraction in chronic asthma mice. Aim 2: Our preliminary studies have shown that smooth muscle specific TMEM16A deletion or TMEM16A specific inhibitors largely inhibit mouse or human, respectively, airway contractions induced by inflammatory mediators that activate G-protein couple receptors (GPCRs). We will use genetic, pharmacological and biophysics approaches to firmly establish that inflammatory mediators activate the GPCR-IP3 receptor-TMEM16A-L-type Ca2+ channel axis to contract airways, and that this axis is potentiated as a result of TMEM16A upregulation under asthma conditions. Aim 3: Since TMEM16A plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, tumorgenesis, cancer progression and vascular remodeling, we propose that TMEM16A is required for ASM remodeling. To investigate this hypothesis, we will examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16A, or genetic deletion of TMEM16A in ASM cells on the remodeling. Since ASM remodeling persists in humans with severe asthma, we will study whether established ASM remodeling (in mice) can be reversed by either pharmacologically blocking TMEM16A or genetically deleting this channel in ASM cells via an inducible genetic knockout approach. We expect that our research will provide answers to two fundamental questions about asthma: why AHR is non-specific to different stimuli, and how ASM remodeling occurs. These answers should be instructive in the development of new anti-asthmatic strategies that not only have broad spectrum effectiveness, but also potentially reverse ASM remodeling, i.e. ?curable? asthma treatments."
"9442157","Project Summary The efficacy of a drug depends directly on its method of delivery, which influences all aspects of its pharmacokinetic properties. Biopharmaceuticals, including protein drugs (e.g., insulin, human growth factor) and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), offer tremendous promise for an increasingly broad portfolio of treatments, but they are highly susceptible to deactivation during formulation and delivery. Among the most promising strategies for the delivery of protein drugs is affinity controlled release (ACR), which allows for the formulation of protein drugs in neutral aqueous environments and largely preserves protein structure and function. ACR uses the selective interaction of a drug with its binding partner immobilized on a polymer matrix to prolong drug release. The rate of release depends directly on the binding affinity of the complex. Binding partners for a given protein, however, are often not available, and tailoring the binding properties to a desired application requires challenging development work. The proposed research seeks to gain full control of the rate of drug release using the extraordinary properties of the synthetic host cucurbit[7]uril (Q7). Q7 binds organic guests in aqueous solution with Kd values ranging from millimolar to attomolar. This unique ability to program the binding affinity will enable two aims, specifically the control of drug release from a hydrogel by conjugating the drug to a guest of desired affinity and modifying the hydrogel with Q7, and by introducing competitive binders to control the binding affinity. If successful, the proposed research will yield novel and general solutions to the problem of controlling the sustained release of protein drugs from compatible matrices. It will generate 5-6 publications with undergraduate coauthors and considerably elevate the biomedical research culture at Trinity University."
"9555913","The purpose of this IAA is to obtain diagnostic services from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Department of Energy (DOE) to support the Early Detection Research Network?s (EDRN) efforts to prioritize, verify and validate candidate biomarkers for cancer early detection, diagnosis and early prognosis. The laboratory, herein Biomarkers Reference and Resource Laboratory (BRCC), will serve as a diagnostic core and will measure the candidate biomarkers in specimens provided by the EDRN using antibody free quantitative assays such as Liquid Chromatography - Selected Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (LC-SRM-MS) and Parallel Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry PRM-MS.  The initial work will focus on measuring EDRN candidate biomarkers in prostate cancer specimens (tissue, plasma, serum and urine). However, the measurements will be later extended to include additional candidate biomarkers for cancers supported by the EDRN including cancers of the bladder, pancreas, liver, colon, lung, breast and ovaries. Currently, the limit of detection of a serum or plasma or urine biomarker, using high-pressure high-resolution separation coupled with intelligent selection and multiplexing (PRISM) LC-SRM-MS, is ~50 pg/mL and limit of detection of a tissue biomarker is ~2 amol/g of tumor tissue."
"9392396","Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients? responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer."

"9560995","Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center  Small Animal Imaging Shared Resource (Translational Research Resource)  Project Summary/Abstract  The Small Animal Imaging Resource facilitates small animal imaging using multiple modalities including depth  resolved or planar optical imaging (fluorescence (FLI), bioluminescence (BLI) and chemiluminescence (CLI)),  MRI, ultrasound, PET/CT, SPECT/CT and planar scintigraphy. Experienced investigators and technical staff  capable of undertaking imaging and assisting in data interpretation are associated with the Resource and  provide consultation and assist with analysis of studies. There is infrastructure for animal handling (e.g.,  anesthesia, infusion, monitoring vital signs). These high end imaging instruments would be beyond the budget  of most research teams and without the Resource, imaging would be unavailable to most investigators.  Resource leaders and members of the Technical Advisory Committee can advise investigators on  experimental planning (optimal experimental approaches, image manipulation, and statistical analysis,  coordinating with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and Environmental Health and Safety),  implementing investigations (access to instruments and scheduling experiments), data analysis and validation  and data archiving. These experts can assist with proof of principle investigations, such as pulse programming  and implementation for novel MRI experiments, design and acquisition or building of MR coils, choice of  reporter molecules and /or genes, radiolabeling procedures and synthesis of ligands. Once experimental  protocols have been established, routine investigations will be performed on a cost recovery basis by  dedicated skilled technicians. During the past year the Resource supported 26 members, all with peer-  reviewed funding support including 25 NIH grants (primarily R01, but also P01, U01, P50) as well as significant  support from CPRIT (25 grants), DOD (8 grants) and private foundations. 26 new publications appeared during  2013 which benefited from the capabilities of the Resource."
"9467042","Project Summary There is an urgent unmet need for simplified and improved blood testing systems that can be utilized outside of centralized clinical settings. Blood cancers are a major health problem in the United States, representing over 10% of all new cancers. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a particularly fast-evolving form of cancer with low rates of survival. Follow initial therapy treatments, AML patients must regularly undergo blood testing to detect against recurrence of the disease. However, existing blood testing paradigms are problematic in that a patient must have their blood drawn by a trained phlebotomist and then wait to receive results from a testing facility. Any delays or lack of compliance in this regular recurrence testing can lead to the development of life threatening symptoms. At Tasso, Inc., we will develop a novel blood-testing platform, the HemoLink-MD, which will allow for self-administered patient blood testing at home and will provide a direct fluorescence readout of nucleic acid levels with minimal user interaction. This blood-testing platform will utilize our existing HemoLink blood collection device and will provide immediate benefit for patients diagnosed with AML. The core technologies developed in this work, novel peptide nucleic acid (PNA) diagnostic techniques and integration strategies for our blood collection devices, will have broad utility towards the development of alternate nucleic acid and protein diagnostic platforms. Tasso, Inc. is uniquely positioned to execute this proposed work due to (1) collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Daniel Appella at the NIH, a pioneering group in the development of PNA diagnostics, and (2) extensive expertise in the development of blood collection devices and fluidic platforms. Overall, our work will improve the quality of life for patients that require regular blood testing by simplifying the testing process and allowing for faster and improved monitoring of critical biomarkers. The proposal consists of two aims. First, a novel nucleic acid detection assay will be developed using PNA binding chemistries and a fluorophore-quencher fluorescent readout. Secondly, this PNA-based assay will be incorporated into an enclosed cartridge that will be integrated directly into our HemoLink blood collection device. We will evaluate the performance of our entire testing platform using whole blood containing our target of interest, allowing us to identify the critical parameters needed to produce an optimized nucleic acid detection platform."
"9418234","ABSTRACT The U-HAND (University of Houston /MD Anderson) Program to Reduce Cancer Disparities seeks to build and maintain a long-term, collaborative partnership between the University of Houston (ISUPS, Hispanic-Serving Institution) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (NCI-designated cancer center) that supports and stimulates excellence in educational programming and innovation in research designed to affect health equity among racial/ethnic groups disproportionately affected by cancer disparities. This will be achieved by better understanding and addressing the social determinants of cancer risk factors through community-engaged educational and scientific practices that synergistically capitalize on the strengths and contributions of the constituent partners. Our educational, outreach, and research initiatives will focus on the reduction of cancer risk among blacks and Hispanics in two key Houston communities: the Third Ward (largely black) and the East End (largely Hispanic). The U-HAND will have three cores: Administrative, Pilot Research Program, and Cancer Research Education Program, which will achieve the following specific aims: 1) Develop a research and educational partnership between the University of Houston, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Houston community to stimulate collaborative cancer disparities research related to tobacco use, poor diet, and physical inactivity among blacks and Hispanics; 2) Support the development of Early Stage Investigators through a rigorous pilot research program; 3) Increase the number of underrepresented racial/ethnic minority students and faculty engaged in cancer disparities research by providing them with research training, mentorship and service learning experiences; and 4) Develop a robust community outreach program focused on engaging community members in cancer disparities education, research, and clinical trials.

The Administrative Core will serve as the strategic hub of the U-HAND partnership, connecting the two partnering institutions, as well as a network of community partners, to address complex social determinants that are the root of cancer disparities."
"9465203","ABSTRACT Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the world?s 6th leading cause of cancer, accounting for 5% of cancer mortality. For many other cancers, molecular characterization has led to sub-classification of disease based on the status of oncogenic drivers in signal transduction pathways, leading to the development of molecularly-targeted agents (MTAs), targeting specific dysregulated proteins in these pathways. HNSCC genetics are highly complex with no clinically actionable mutations or classification beyond HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors. Classification to improve therapeutic decision-making is needed for HNSCC. Cetuximab (CTX), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-binding monoclonal antibody (mAb), is FDA- approved for HNSCC as a monotherapy or combined with radiation or platinum-based therapy. Though having a substantial clinical impact in a small proportion (~13%) of patients, treatment with CTX is associated with serious adverse reactions, resulting in interrupted therapy in 3-10% of patients. Due to this high risk, along with a high cost and the low response rate, a companion diagnostic (CDx) to identify patients most likely to respond to CTX is urgently required. We propose to develop a live tumor cell based CDx to guide the identification of CTX-responsive patients based on tumor ex vivo functional responses which are predictive of clinical outcomes. Since traditional tissue processing strips tumor cells of their biological integrity it is only suitable for histologic review, not allowing analysis of dynamic biomarkers. BioMarker Strategies is developing the SnapPath Process and Pathology Multi Analyte Profiles (PathMAP) technologies for live tissue processing of solid tumors using a single-use cartridge, which holds the sample and all the necessary reagents and consumables, automating and standardizing tumor processing and treatment to enable highly predictive and standardized tests. The tumor cells' responses are scored against PathMAP, a locked classification model. PathMAP tests can help guide medical oncologists in their treatment decisions for cancer patients. The proposed CDx will measure the pharmacodynamic response upon exposure to CTX of specific phosphoproteins in MAPK, JAK/STAT, and PI3K pathways, the key pathways in HNSCC pathophysiology. We propose to: 1) Optimize Conditions and Response Profile to Predict CTX Sensitivity to detect strong pharmacodynamic  responses in sensitive cells and minimal responses in resistant cells; 2) Evoke Functional Signaling Profiles (FSP) Against CTX in Complex Samples by first using clinically-  relevant patient derived xenograft (PDX) samples and then human clinical samples. The proposed research will serve as a feasibility study determining percent suppression cut-off values for predictive biomarkers and confirming operationalization of the test in complex samples. It will also determine the sample size for a future larger multisite sample collection in Phase II."

"9406614","Project Summary Severe asthma accounts for a disproportionate share of the morbidity associated with asthma. Multiple biological therapies are now becoming available that target eosinophilic or Type 2- driven asthma. However, data from SARP indicate that >60% of patients have severe asthma with a neutrophilic phenotype (SANP), as defined by induced sputum differentials. These patients experience excess morbidity, and there are currently no therapies that effectively target neutrophilic inflammation. We recently completed a study wherein we showed that targeting mast cells with imatinib (an inhibitor of stem-cell factor signaling at KIT) was most effective in patients with a neutrophilic phenotype. Further, we found that reductions in serum tryptase could identify patients most likely to respond to this treatment. Additionally, we have shown that in severe asthma, despite aggressive corticosteroid therapy (which normally reduces inflammatory eicosanoids) these patients continue to elaborate pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and low-pro-resolving eicosanoids. This is indicated by our discovery of persistent elevation of LTB4 (which is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant) in exhaled breath condensate. Lastly, IL-6 has been associated with non-Type 2 asthma, insulin resistance, and TH17 skewing of CD4+ cells. IL6 receptor polymorphisms have been associated with asthma risk, and high IL6 has been associated with reduced lung function and increased exacerbations, even in a cohort of severe asthmatics. We posit the following set of primary hypotheses and in each case we list the severe asthma phenotype and its phenotype marker(s) (PM), our primary candidate response marker at 2 months (RM) (in parentheses our secondary RMs), and the targeted intervention (TI). Our hypotheses are that in subjects with : 1) SANP with high serum IL6 (PM), a fall in?C-reactive protein (TH17 cells, insulin resistance ) (RM), will identify those more likely to improve after anti-IL6 therapy (TI); 2) SANP with high exhaled LTB4 (PM), a fall in exhaled LTB4 (urinary cysteinyl leukotrienes) (RM) will identify those more likely to improve with a 5- lipoxygenase inhibitor (5-LOi) (that blocks production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids); 3) Severe asthma with increased sputum neutrophils (PM), a fall in serum tryptase (sputum supernatant tryptase) (RM) will identify asthmatics more likely to improve after treatment with a KIT inhibitor (TI). Our adaptive study design and treatment approach will allow us to define the threshold values of our RM that identify patients with a higher likelihood of response to targeted therapy. We have a team of seasoned trialists in adult and pediatric asthma, experts in biomarker development, the mechanisms behind these biomarkers, and adaptive trial design and integrative analyses, which will add significant strength to a PRECISE network."
"9309883","PROJECT SUMMARY  A couple's economic circumstances are strongly associated with marital satisfaction and risk for divorce, and these associations are especially strong among lower-income couples. Yet the effect of economic changes on marital outcomes remains a topic of scholarly dispute. Economic and demographic research consistently reveals that rising unemployment rates and other indicators of economic hardship are associated with lower divorce rates. Psychological research, however, shows that the direct experience of economic insecurity is associated with higher risk of divorce. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to reconcile these literatures and explain how a couple's broader economic context interacts with the direct experience of their financial circumstances to affect marital outcomes over time. A premise of this work is that the social and temporal context of a couple shapes the way spouses interpret their own economic circumstances. When the people around a couple are also struggling financially, spouses should be less likely to blame each other for their own economic difficulties. When spouses perceive their incomes to be improving over time, they should be more optimistic about the economic viability of the marriage, even if their current income level remains low. These social and temporal comparison processes should directly affect associations between couples' current economic circumstances and their satisfaction with their marriage and risk for divorce. To evaluate this model, the proposed research will collect four additional waves of data from an existing sample of 375 first-married couples living in low-income neighborhoods. In a previously-funded project, these couples were assessed as newlyweds, and provided 5 waves of interview and observational data over 4 years (Time 1 to Time 5). The new data collection will include additional interviews and social network assessments collected in couples' homes every 9 months (Time 6 to Time 9). Analyses of the new data will examine: 1) how changes in couples' financial circumstances covary with changes in their evaluations of marital satisfaction, 2) whether spouses' attributions for their current financial circumstances moderate associations between their circumstances and their marital outcomes, 3) how social networks and social comparison processes shape the way spouses understand their own financial circumstances, 4) how trajectories of change and temporal comparison processes shape the way spouses understand their own financial circumstances, 5) how these comparison processes interact with couples' financial circumstances to account for trajectories of change in marital satisfaction and risk of divorce. Support for this perspective would have immediate implications for supporting lower-income couples and families, suggesting new targets for intervention (i.e., social and temporal comparisons), and allowing policy-makers to target vulnerable couples with more precision (e.g., networks instead of individuals)."

African Americans (AA) are at disproportionate risk for both  incarceration and HIV infections. A growing body of evidence highlights the efficacy of a once daily medication,  emtricitabine/tenofovir, also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in reducing HIV acquisition. However,  structural and social barriers can undermine optimal PrEP uptake, adherence, and retention in care and must  be addressed especially among those with recent CJ experience. Our proposed study is directly aligned with  NIMHD Science Visioning to advance intervention approaches to improve minority health or to reduce health  disparities. Our proposed study will: provide a novel exploration of facilitators and barriers to PrEP; allow us to  target hard to reach populations, including MSM and substance users (both of which are top funding priority  groups for the National Institutes of Health) who experience intersecting markers of HIV risk; and inform  regional, and possibly national, intervention approaches to combat the overlapping epidemic of HIV and  incarceration: The specific aims of the project are: Aim 1: Perform a qualitative assessment of facilitators  and barriers to PrEP uptake among high-risk jail detainees, systems and interactor levels; Aim 2:  Develop the PrEP-LINK intervention and perform an open label evaluation with high-risk individuals  being discharged from the Pulaski County Jail; Aim 3: Conduct a pilot RCT of the PrEP-LINK  intervention among high-risk men being released from the Pulaski County Jail. Results will inform a  subsequent multi-site RCT to test efficacy of the intervention in improving PrEP uptake, adherence, and  retention in care among men with CJ-experience."
"9427559","ABSTRACT Social bonds are central to our experience, shaping both our health and happiness. Few of these bonds are as important to well-being as one?s relationship with a partner. Because social bonds play such an important role in human lives, studies of neural mechanisms of adult attachments in animal models have a high translational value. Most commonly used laboratory models, however, do not form strong and enduring attachments. For this reason, the socially monogamous prairie vole, in which males and females form stable pair-bonds and raise young together, have become an increasingly important species in social neuroscience. Work on prairie voles, for example, has revealed how the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin help bring about pair bonds by modulating the activity of subcortical reward regions. Although vole research has led to human studies that examine reward circuitry in the context of attachment, most work in human social neuroscience is focused on how cortical structures contribute to social cognition, an area that is understudied in animal models. Motivated by this gap between human and animal studies, we propose to develop and apply modern systems neuroscience tools for the automated and unbiased analyses of brain structure and function in the prairie vole. Our aim is to comprehensively map the diverse circuits that are modified during pair-bond formation, and to examine how these circuits are used during the expression of bonds.  In Aim 1, we will develop a detailed three-dimensional prairie-vole brain atlas, and integrate it into a computational pipeline for the automated whole-brain imaging of neuronal cell types, long-range projections, and synaptic densities. We will then use these methods to map structural differences between mouse and prairie vole brains, between male and female prairie voles, and between bonded and un-bonded voles. In Aim 2, we will use our whole-brain approach to map brain immediate-early gene induction (including c-fos and alternatives) across a 24h interval of pair-bond formation. We follow this by identifying circuit activity associated with the selective recognition of a partner, or with the discrimination between a partner and stranger. These experiments will identify the substrates of bond formation, and will clarify how these brain regions interact with other circuits during the expression of selective attachment. Finally, in Aim 3, we will study how one specific cortical region, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), contributes to the formation and expression of pair-bonds. This work follows a growing body of data implicating the RSC in long-term memory, human social cognition and prairie-vole bonding. The study will use AAV-based chemogenetic manipulations of the RSC to investigate its contribution to whole-brain activity patterns and prairie vole bonding."

"9567685","Cancer Prevention and Survivorship ? Project Summary Cancer Prevention and Survivorship (CPS) focuses on pre-cancerous biology and its translation into initial testing of new prevention strategies, as well as interventions aimed at improving the quality of life for cancer survivors. In the Pre-Cancerous Biology and Risk Biomarkers theme, research centers on tissue changes that serve as indicators or predictors of malignant transformation and potential targets for developing new preventive strategies. In the Prevention and Survivorship Translational Research theme, basic scientists from the Pre-Cancerous Biology and Risk Biomarkers theme work with behavioral and clinical researchers for early testing of new strategies. CPS is unique from Cancer Control and Population Control (CCPH) in that CPS focuses on the discovery of new biomarkers and early phase testing of prevention and survivorship interventions using high-risk individuals, whereas CCPH focuses on implementation of known effective strategies. CPS has 21 full and 10 associate members from 16 departments/divisions with expertise in cancer biology, medical and surgical oncology, radiation biology, gastroenterology, nursing, clinical health psychology, nutrition, exercise physiology and biomedical informatics. In 2015, CPS increased the number of NCI (12) and total peer-reviewed (29) funded grants from 6 and 24 since 2011, the previous CCSG submission. Seven of the peer-reviewed grants are multi-PI awards, up from one. NCI and total peer-reviewed funding increased from $1,804,303 and $6,244,484 to $3,098,479 and $11,890,377. From 2012-2015, over 800 patients were accrued to 15 intervention trials. Twelve of these trials were investigator-initiated and three peer-reviewed funded. Kansas and Missouri have high rates of adult obesity. Thus, many of the CPS interventional trials focus on physical activity and weight reduction, in close collaboration with catchment area partners. CPS members have published 382 articles since 2012 of which 164 (43%) had intra-programmatic, 127 (33%) had inter-programmatic and 204 (54%) had inter-institutional collaborations. Forty-five publications (12%) had a journal impact factor ? 8. CPS contributes to KUCC with significant leadership (Director and three ADs, Chair PRMC, Co-chair SWOG Survivorship Committee) and highly translational biomarker based early phase prevention and survivorship trials often with parallel animal studies. The SWOG chair position helps move promising pilots into larger co-operative group trials. KUCC contributes to CPS both through shared resources and pilot funding. In the future, CPS will continue to build on its strengths of novel pre-cancerous models, new risk and response biomarkers, high-risk cohorts for early phase trials, energy balance and natural products in chemoprevention trials. CPS will increase collaborations with CB to expand biomarker research in metabolomics, with D3ET to develop natural product analogues for primary prevention and with CCPH to increase disparity and catchment area-relevant research, as well as educational initiatives and mentoring."
"9425651","PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be debilitating and is related to impaired occupational and social functioning, chronic medical problems, disability, and increases in suicidality, violence, and criminal behavior. Over 10 million Americans are treated annually for sudden, severe illnesses or injuries that require very urgent treatment; and an estimated 20% of hospitalized traumatic injury patients have persisting mental health problems. Identifying those at risk for later disorder is difficult, and no screens can accurately predict PTSD in Americans exposed to traumatic stress. In research on adults exposed to traumatic injury, theory-driven pre- trauma, time-of-trauma, and post-trauma risk factors were strongly related to outcomes and accurately identified those who later had elevated PTSD symptoms. We propose to extend our work to a population level to create a screen for use in U.S. hospitals. In diverse populations of sudden illness or injury patients at hospitals sites in Baltimore, MD, Akron, OH, and Palo Alto, CA, data will be collected on theory-driven, highly predictive pre-trauma (gender, education, socioeconomic status, ethnicity/race, childhood home life and parental dysfunction, past trauma exposure); time-of-trauma (trauma intensity, pre-trauma home life; pre- trauma life stress), and post-trauma (acute PTSD and dissociation symptoms, negative thinking; post-trauma life stress; post-trauma social support; post-trauma social constraints) risk factors and later symptoms of disorder in 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities. Data will also be collected on five variables found to relate to disparities in mental health or PTSD: discrimination/racism, competing needs, community cohesion, stigma, and negative expectations about treatment. Data collected will include sufficiently large samples of African American, Latino, Asians, and mixed ethnicity/race patients for separately analyses for these groups. Relationships of all predictors and disparities variables to outcomes and covariance among predictors and disparities variables will be examined to select risk factor and disparities variables that are highly predictive, similarly related to outcomes across subgroups, and can be measured with the fewest items and items that are briefer and less personal, stigmatizing, and difficult to understand. In Wave II of data collection, predictive performance will be assessed in a new sample of 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities with a goal of identifying at least 80% (sensitivity) of those who later have high PTSD symptoms and at least 70% (specificity) of those who recover well."
"9536284","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glia, which constitutes astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, are the most proliferative and abundant cell types in the central nervous system. Abnormal development of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is associated with a number of neurological diseases and disorders such as amyolateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and glioblastoma, the deadliest of brain cancers. The basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors Ascl1 and Olig2 are crucial for the specification and development of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and are highly expressed in glioblastoma. The proposed project aims to: 1) determine the role and function of Ascl1 and Olig2 in regulating the generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the gray matter and white matter in the spinal cord; 2) determine the in vivo requirement of Ascl1 and Olig2 in brain tumors of a mouse model of glioblastoma; and 3) utilize Next-Generation sequencing techniques to identify on a genome-wide scale the DNA-binding profiles and direct transcriptional target genes of Ascl1 and Olig2 in glial progenitors in comparison to tumor cells of the glioblastoma mouse model. The culmination of this study will lead to new insights on the genetic regulatory networks of glial heterogeneity and glioblastoma development in the central nervous system."
"9435492","Our understanding and treatment of serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, has lagged that for other major medical illnesses for at least two important reasons, including 1) the unparalleled complexity of the human brain and our only nascent understanding of psychiatric disease pathophysiology, and 2) the still limited translational tools available for testing and validating putative mechanisms in humans in vivo. In what many are hailing as a breakthrough in our neurobiological understanding of schizophrenia, Sekar and colleagues recently implicated an ?immune system protein,? complement component 4 (C4), in its etiology. Guided by a dramatic, albeit unexplained, genome-wide significant association in the major histocompatibility complex, they identified 1) complex structural variation in the C4 gene that was associated with parallel, dose- dependent increases in both schizophrenia risk and brain C4A RNA expression, 2) elevations in C4A RNA in post- mortem brain tissue from schizophrenia patients, and 3) using a mouse genetic model, a promising pathophysiological mechanism (i.e., aberrant synaptic pruning), whereby elevated C4A levels lead to disrupted synaptic integrity. To date, however, the relevance of this mechanism has yet to be established for the living human brain. Our group has developed a novel radiotracer, 11C-UCB-J, which now enables the imaging of synaptic density in the living human brain with positron-emission tomography (PET).  The current exploratory/developmental (R21) application will apply this breakthrough methodology to explore whether genetic variation in C4 is associated with altered synaptic density in humans. If confirmed, the current study would provide compelling support for the aberrant synaptic pruning hypothesis of C4-mediated risk for schizophrenia, for the first time in the living human brain. As such, it would validate and build-upon a crucial breakthrough in our mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and its causes."
"9421510","Project Summary/Abstract Decades of research and clinical observations have established that episodic memory, the ability to remember recently experienced events, depends on the hippocampus and associated structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices [1, 2]. It is thought that the neuronal mechanisms supporting episodic memory for spatial context involves place and grid cells found in the MTL that increase in firing rate when an animal is in a specific location during navigation [3-7]. Furthermore, successful formation and retrieval of spatial memory is thought to be dependent upon the integration of MTL structures through coordinated oscillatory activity related to spike timing dependent plasticity [8-15]. The proposed project will investigate the relationship between spatial navigation, human memory, oscillatory activity, and spatially selective cells using intracranial single-unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings in humans. We will examine patients who are implanted with the Neuropace Responsive Neurostimulator (RNS) or DEPTH electrodes for clinical evaluation and treatment of epilepsy. The RNS device will allow us to stimulate and record LFP activity from the MTL during real world and virtual reality (VR) spatial navigation using simultaneous full body motion capture and immersive VR headset technology. The DEPTH electrodes will allow us to stimulate and record single-unit and LFP activity during immersive VR spatial navigation. Together these studies will have access to over 30 subjects over the project period through an interdepartmental collaboration among clinical and basic science leaders at UCLA. Since our studies address basic questions about the role of oscillations and single neurons in memory, it is anticipated that such basic studies will contribute to bridging of findings between species and laying the scientific foundation for helping future patients with diseases where memory is impaired such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy."
"9341262","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammalian hosts and their intestinal microbiota have co-evolved over millennia. Although customarily described as commensal, the microbiota of the gut is now known to be crucial for the normal development of host immunity and for the homeostasis of the immune system. An imbalance in microbial colonization-dysbiosis-is associated with diverse inflammatory and autoimmune syndromes, such as the inflammatory bowel diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract. During normal immunologic development and pathophysiological reactions to challenges, small molecules produced by commensal microbes, such as lipids, can play crucial roles in shaping the immune system and its responses.  Bacteroides fragilis, a well-studied resident of the human lower gastrointestinal tract, exerts interesting immune-modulating biological effects in various autoimmune diseases. In germ-free mice, wild-type B. fragilis monocolonization suppresses gut natural killer T cell (NKT cell) numbers and protects the animals from NKT cell-mediated colitis, whereas a sphingolipid- knockout strain does not provide such protection. Primary results imply that unique sphingolipid mediators originated from B. fragilis can contribute to these protective mechanisms.  The current proposal describes a 5-year plan of mentored research focusing on the unique sphingolipids produced by B. fragilis and other commensal Bacteroidales and assessing their ability to modulate host immunity and protect the host from excessive inflammation. This work addresses three specific aims: (1) Acquire a comprehensive sphingolipidomic map of commensal Bacteroidales and investigate biosynthesis pathways of immunoregulatory sphingolipids, (2) Chemically synthesize commensal glycosphingolipids and assess regulation of NKT cell activity and proliferation and (3) Investigate the NKT-regulatory functions of commensal glycosphingolipids during immune maturation and upon pathological challenge. In order to attaining these goals, the principal investigator will gain knowledge and experience in microbiology and immunology based on a broad understanding of analytical chemistry and lipid mediator immunology. Didactic and technical training, in conjunction with expert mentorship by Dr. Dennis Kasper (primary mentor) and a scientific advisory committee, will aid in the successful completion of the project, which represents a key step toward independence of the applicant."
"9232608","Project Summary/Abstract Cancer cells within tumors often exist in highly heterogeneous phenotypic states, which is a major challenge in cancer therapeutics. Although there have been great advances in studying cellular heterogeneity and discovering hidden phenotypes, little effort has been made in achieving mechanistic understandings of each phenotype in heterogeneous cell populations in living cells. Most of our understandings of cell biological processes are based on the ensemble average of experimental measurements drawn from cell population. However, biological systems are inherently heterogeneous even in isogenic cell cultures. One of the prominent examples of cellular/subcellular heterogeneity is cell protrusion, driven by actin polymerization pushing the leading edge plasma membrane. Actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic complex system which integrates numerous biochemical and mechanical signals. Hundreds of actin regulators collectively organize actin structures, which are spatiotemporally heterogeneous in micron length and minute time scales. Due to this heterogeneous issues, experimental outcomes are often context-dependent and difficult to interpret. Thus, it is necessary to develop a new quantitative live cell imaging method which allows us to achieve distinct molecular understandings of each cellular phenotype from heterogeneous cell population. Therefore, the goal of this project is to deconvolve the heterogeneity of cell protrusion to characterize each cellular/subcellular protrusive phenotype by combining quantitative live cell imaging and machine learning analysis, and we will determine the coordination of distinct sets of actin regulators with respect to each protrusive phenotype. This will lead to mechanistic understanding specific to each protrusive phenotype. The central hypothesis in this project is that heterogeneous cell protrusions are driven by the distinct sets of spatiotemporal coordinated actin regulators and traction forces at the leading edge. We will Evaluate how the coordination of actin regulators at the leading edge generates heterogeneous multiple protrusions (Aim 1). We will Evaluate how actin organization at the leading edge during the retraction generates reinforced multiple cell protrusion (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how the traction forces at the leading edge play roles in heterogeneous cell protrusions (Aim 3). It is expected that the experimental and computational imaging tools developed in this project can be applied to many complex cytoskeleton related processes including cellular morphogenesis by revealing a wide range of molecular and cellular coordination at various length and time scales. We also anticipate the new insight on cellular/subcellular heterogeneity in cell protrusion will allow us to better understand the heterogeneity of cancer metastasis, where only small number of tumor cells metastasize."
"9464945","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated cancer center in Georgia, which is now the eighth most populous state and has the largest land area among states east of the Mississippi River. As the main tertiary cancer care and cancer research institution in the state, Winship has committed its four research programs as supported by its six shared resources to address the specific challenges associated with the cancer burden in Georgia. These challenges include: high tobacco usage and incidence of tobacco- related cancers; high proportion of cancer patients who are African American or black and/or have significant cancer disparity issues in their care, prognosis, and/or outcome; and low health literacy levels. Winship's mission is to lessen the burden of cancer for the citizens of Georgia, its primary catchment area. This will be accomplished by: (1) seeking greater insights into the molecular, genetic, and epigenetic basis of cancer; (2) discovering new knowledge that drives improvements in cancer detection, prevention, and/or therapy; (3) developing or defining novel therapeutic targets and/or agents as a pathway to better cancer therapies; and (4) studying and implementing population-based strategies to lessen the cancer burden in the state. The 164 Winship core members are actively engaged in one of four Winship research programs, all of which have a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary research: Cancer Cell Biology, Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, and Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics. Winship's members are supported by six shared resources: Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Cancer Animal Models Shared Resource, Cancer Tissue and Pathology Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Genomics Shared Resource, Emory Integrated Proteomics Shared Resource, and the Integrated Imaging Shared Resource; and two developing shared resources: Winship Research Informatics and Intervention Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Developing Shared Resources. Winship members are currently supported by $84.8M in total research funding (as of 3/31/2016) awarded via Emory University. Winship members Curran and Bruner serve as PIs on two NCI awards to the NRG Oncology Foundation for a total of $25.6M in support of clinical research infrastructure. Patient enrollment in Winship's interventional and non-interventional trials continues to increase, especially among patients from under-represented minority groups, and these activities have contributed to the FDA- approval of several novel anti-cancer agents during the present funding period. Winship has outstanding institutional commitment, with more than $200 million in institutional support committed over the next five years, a level almost twice that committed in 2011. Winship enjoys the same reporting line and organizational position as Emory's schools of medicine, public health, and nursing. Winship is uniquely positioned to apply its scientific strengths, outstanding membership, robust infrastructure, strong institutional support, and comprehensive training programs to fulfill its mission of lessening the burden of cancer on the state of Georgia and beyond."

"9444127","Project Summary: Core 3, Behavior Automation  Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. This multi-component research project aims to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The individual parts of the project cohere conceptually, in part, because they all involve rodents trained to perform a type of decision-making task that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. To produce enough subjects for these experiments, this Core will scale up an existing high-throughput rat training facility run by technicians and adapt it for mice. This expansion will quintuple the project?s capacity for rodent training. To do so, we will take advantage of the expertise of the project leader in developing and managing such a training facility for sophisticated cognitive tasks in an existing virtual reality infrastructure, software, and hardware. Once this facility is operational, the Core will manage it and troubleshoot problems as needed. It will develop new hardware and software components for training rigs to make technician interventions as reproducible and error-free as possible. Because the most crucial and time-consuming aspect of mouse virtual training is ensuring that the head-?xed animal is properly aligned to the ball and the projection system, the Core will develop an automated alignment system based on image registration and actuators to replace the current manual alignment. It will develop software tools and standardized technician procedures to ensure consistency in rodent training, prevent training errors, detect hardware failures, and monitor the health of the animals. This centralized facility will promote rigor and reproducibility by reducing variability in animal training across labs, increase the rate of data acquisition, and free personnel to focus on designing and carrying out creative experiments. In the long run, the entire neuroscience community will bene?t from this e?ort, as the software and hardware tools and management protocols produced will be made freely available, along with their documentation. These tools will enable other researchers to introduce automated training for well-controlled cognitive tasks in their own laboratories, leading to improved e?ciency, rigor, and reproducibility in behavioral research across the ?eld of neuroscience."
"9419149","Pilot Research Project 2: Lifestyle-Associated Metabolites Drive Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Prostate Cancer Disparities SUMMARY In South Carolina (SC), prostate cancer mortality differences between blacks with African ancestry (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) are amongst the highest in the nation. Emerging studies demonstrate inherent genetic and molecular characteristics within tumors contribute towards the racial disparity. This study aims to define the impact of a group of lifestyle-associated metabolites known as advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) on promoting a more aggressive prostate cancer phenotype through the upregulation of miR-204, MYC and the downregulation of the androgen receptor (AR). miR-204 is encoded within the TRMP3 gene9 and studies have demonstrated that expression of miR-204 and TRPM3 are positively correlated both in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, TRMP3 is amplified in 32% of neuroendocrine prostate cancer cases. The investigators have supporting data that AGEs can upregulate miR-204 and drive NED in vitro; and in prostate cancer patients, both AGEs15 and miR-204 are elevated in AA men, when compared to EA men. Preliminary data supports metformin as an endogenous inhibitor of miR-204 which in turn reverses the neuroendocrine phenotype. This study will be co-led by Dr. Ashley Evans-Knowell at South Carolina State University (SCSU) and Dr. Victoria Findlay at the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC). Hypothesis: The occurrence of high AGEs and ADT drives neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) through up- regulation of miR-204 and this event is more prevalent in AAs, accounting for the higher prostate cancer mortality rates observed in AA men. Specific Aim 1: To investigate the role of AGE, ADT and miR-204 in driving neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer. This aim will be led by Dr. Findlay (MUSC-HCC). Specific Aim 2: To establish miR-204 and AGE levels in a cohort of human prostate cancer patients and to correlate those levels with race, clinical, and other demographic data. This aim will be led by Dr. Evans- Knowell (SCSU). Impact: A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive NED within prostate tumors will allow the development of novel strategies to prevent or reverse this process in patients receiving ADT, thus potentially improving clinical outcomes. The proposed mechanistic link between lifestyle-associated AGEs, microRNA regulation, and NED in prostate cancer could lead to interventions to improve prostate cancer outcomes for AA men. This project is synergistically related to the other research projects included in this application."
"9447783","PROJECT SUMMARY: The major goal of the proposed research is to understand the molecular basis of lysosomal storage diseases, a collection of more than 40 inherited metabolic disorders that affect approximately 1 in 7,700 births. Lysosomal storage disorders are caused by defects in single genes, where the loss of a functional enzyme in the lysosome leads to accumulation of substrate and the development of disease symptoms. Lysosomal storage diseases are some of the best understood members of the larger protein-misfolding disease family, which includes Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Because lysosomal storage diseases are generally caused by defects in single genes, the genetics of the diseases are simpler than in many human diseases. Lysosomal storage diseases are very active targets of clinical research, with enzyme replacement therapy, pharmacological chaperone therapy, substrate reduction therapy, bone marrow transplantation, gene therapy, and stem cell therapy approaches either approved or under clinical investigation. Despite hundreds of kilograms of recombinant enzymes produced industrially, the lack of basic knowledge about the structure, ligand binding, catalysis, and stability of the clinical targets has slowed clinical progress. For a lysosomal enzyme to function correctly, several critical steps must occur: the newly synthesized polypeptide must translocate into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), where it must fold correctly; it must be post-translationally modified, allowing it to traffic through the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome; there, it must have the correct catalytic machinery and sufficient stability to perform its enzymatic task. A failure in any of these steps leads to loss of enzymatic function and subsequent disease progression. The understanding and treatment of lysosomal storage diseases has been limited by lack of understanding of the molecular defects that lead to disease symptoms. We will examine the basic biochemistry and biophysics at the root of lysosomal storage diseases, which will propel further translational progress on the diseases. To better understand the development of lysosomal storage diseases and other protein folding diseases, we propose to study the folding, stability, and function of lysosomal enzymes. We have developed methods for studying the biochemistry, biophysics, and cell biology of human lysosomal enzymes, allowing us to interrogate each stage in the maturation of the enzymes, from synthesis to trafficking to function in the lysosome. We are in the unique position to apply our expertise in the structural and cellular biology of human glycoproteins to the problem of lysosomal storage disorders. We have determined the three- dimensional structures of more human lysosomal enzymes than any other group, putting us in a unique position to study the basic biochemistry and biophysics of the family of proteins. By directly tackling difficult targets (human lysosomal enzymes are typically heavily glycosylated and otherwise post-translationally modified multimers) of high clinical significance, we advance the knowledge and treatment of disease."

"9466780","Significance: Of the 4 million babies born in the US each year, 120,000 (3%) have a complex birth defect. Some defects, such as spina bifida, warrant in utero interventions to improve fetal outcomes. Spina bifida is a condition where there is incomplete closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. Texas Children?s Hospital has pioneered a fetoscopic method to address spina bifida. While much of the surgery can be performed through ports, the uterus currently needs to be exteriorized in order to position the fetus appropriately and place sutures to anchor the chorioamniotic membranes to the uterine wall. The sutures are placed to prevent preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) which leads to both maternal and fetal complications. PPROM is a common complication of fetal surgery, occurring in about 30% of minimally invasive cases. The risk of pPROM, both maternal and fetal, often offsets the benefits of fetal treatment. Innovation: The Uterine wall-Membrane Anchor (UMA) is a linear device that facilitates the percutaneous suturing of chorioamniotic membranes to the uterine wall during fetoscopic surgery. Two cylindrical anchors are deployed on either side of the uterine wall and connected by a knotted suture that can be tightened to secure the membranes. This solution facilitates the conversion of existing open fetal procedures to percutaneous procedures and potentially the development of new fetal interventions. Approach: In this SBIR Phase I project, Fannin Innovation Studio will optimize the prototype device design and test it in benchtop and animal models. Aim 1 is focused on refining and optimizing the UMA prototype and developing the surgical procedure to deploy the device. This will accelerate our progress towards clinical implementation and commercialization. In Aim 2, the optimized prototype developed in Aim 1 will be tested in pregnant rabbit chronic studies and pregnant sheep acute studies. We believe that the UMA device will bring value to patients, doctors, and children?s hospitals by providing a solution that reduces maternal and fetal complications, expands patient population through the development of a safer percutaneous procedure, and leads to better outcomes for children with spina bifida."
"9466971","Novel Glyco-Tests to Predict Chemoresistance Project summary Two carbohydrate structures whose expression levels on ovarian tumor cells are directly linked to tumor responses to platinum-based chemotherapy (pt-CHEMOs) are identified. While not found on healthy ovarian cells, these glycans (glycomarkers 1 and 2) are expressed to varying degrees on cancerous cells, rendering each of these molecules a reliable indicator in predicting responses to pt-CHEMOs. A highly sensitive lectin histochemistry (LHC) assay was developed to detect each glycomarker on Formalin-fixed, Paraffin-embedded, (FFPE) tissue sections. This LHC performance was initially confirmed for specificity, reproducibility, and sensitivity, using various staining systems. Its feasibility for clinical use was consequently confirmed on a training panel composed of 64 healthy and cancerous ovarian tissues. In a retrospective study with 27 ovarian cancer specimens, collected before any treatment, LHC correctly predicted the response to first- line chemotherapy in 25 of 27 (92%) and 19 of 27 (70%) tested for glycomarkers 1 and 2, respectively; The preliminary cut-points of the glycomarker expressions were deduced for three clinical groups of refractory (failing the initial chemotherapy) 0-10%; resistant (recurring within six months following chemotherapy)10-30%; and sensitive (in remission for at least 6 months following chemotherapy) >30%.  In Phase I of the proposed study, the LHC validation for chemo reactivity will be ascertained by testing the glycomarker expressions on a large set (140) of un-treated ovarian cancer specimens whose response to pt- CHEMOs will be available for retrospective correlation analysis. Triplxed-immunofluorescent with a panel of three markers consisting of CA125 (ovarian cancer marker), PanCK (epithelial marker) and a glycomarker, will quantify the glycomarker expressions on tumor sections prior to treatment. Both digital cytometry and scoring by two pathologists, in blind fashion, will be used to analyze the LHC assay. Statistical analysis with a large data set will address the following study aims; Aim 1) to determine the correlation between drug response and glycomarker expression levels and; Aim 2) to define the cut-points for each glycomarker expression on ovarian cancer patients in three clinical classifications (refractory/resistant/sensitive). The key milestone in Phase-I will be completing the statistical validation, to determine whether the LHC can be offered as a laboratory-developed test (LDT), not requiring FDA approval. Meanwhile, we will be developing required data, in Phase II, to get prepared for FDA submission. The final commercial product will be clinical kits to provide guidance for personalized chemotherapy. Our approach to predicting resistance to pt-CHEMOs will also have prospective applications to other cancer types that express these glycomarkers and are also treated with pt-CHEMOS. Overall, the LHC offers a companion diagnostic test for Pt-CHEMOs that identifies chemoresistant patients, thereby giving them a hope at being treated sooner and with more promising second line options, and consequently, increasing their chance of survival and quality of life."
"9414852","Abstract: A Multimodal Atlas of Human Brain Cell Types  Cell types are the building blocks of the brain, including the neuron types forming specific neuronal circuits responsible for perception, cognition and action, and the non-neuronal elements performing other essential roles for proper brain function. A deep understanding of cell types is essential to understand brain structure and function, as well as mechanisms underlying dysfunction in disorders and injury, which in general affect specific cellular components either through underlying genetic abnormalities or through selective vulnerability to insults and injury. Despite the obvious importance of cell types, our understanding of their diversity, specific properties and discreteness is highly incomplete. This is particularly true in the human brain, where technological limitations, lack of access to living brain tissues, and the sheer size and complexity has hampered progress; however, a new set of molecular, anatomical and physiological tools and techniques are now available that work in brain tissue both from model organisms and human. Standardization and scale-up of these techniques offers to dramatically change the field by providing a broad and deep understanding of the building blocks of the human brain, and their conserved and unique features.  We propose here to bring together an interdisciplinary consortium of world leaders in single cell transcriptomics, human cellular physiology and anatomy, and neuronal modeling to create a comprehensive atlas of human brain cell types as a community data resource. The foundation of this atlas is a molecular classification of cell types based on large-scale single cell transcriptomics, combining a broad survey of cell types across the entire brain and spinal cord with a deep analysis of the neocortex and hippocampus, regions in which it is possible to analyze functional and anatomical properties of cells in living neurosurgical resections. The distribution of these molecular cell types will be mapped on tissue sections using single molecular multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization to create a quantitative census of cell types in different brain regions. To understand the properties of these molecular cell types, we will standardize methods across a consortium of experts in human slice patch clamp electrophysiology to study the structure, function and molecular properties of cortical cell types. Finally, we will derive tools to classify cell types, perform neuronal modeling to understand and predict the function of cell types, and compare cell type properties between mouse and human. The outcome will be the first detailed atlas of human brain cell types and the development of standardized methods for human brain study that are likely to catalyze rapid progress in basic and clinical neuroscience."
"9471592","1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Background: HIV continues to spread at alarming rates and a great number of people living with HIV and  3 AIDS are not engaged in care, with significant racial disparities in outcomes. Despite advances in treatment  4 and other interventions, rates of new HIV infections in the US remain high. We believe that shame and stigma  5 of HIV contribute significantly to these poor outcomes. Attitudes towards those with HIV and other stigmatized  6 conditions have not changed much. It is essential to promote empirical research and theory building for  7 stigma that would have both basic and applied scientific significance, including implications for policymakers  8 and opinion leaders. There is need to develop and evaluate interventions that are tailored to reduce stigma  9 particularly in communities of color. Also, it is critical to mentor junior minority researchers involved in stigma 10 research. The overarching goal is to decrease HIV and other health-related stigma, and improve health 11 outcomes. The main goal of this proposal is to strengthen research capacity, particularly in junior minority 12 researchers in the field of stigma, and to foster research-community partnerships. Methods: The proposed 13 International Conference on Stigma will be the eighth held since 2010 and will take place on November 17, 14 2017 at Howard University. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers, community leaders, 15 policy makers, academia, students, and affected individuals with emphasis on inclusion of racial and gender 16 minorities and women. Howard University and its partners have an established structure of committees and 17 volunteers to orchestrate this event. The conference has had a strong online presence through social media 18 and its webpage---www.whocanyoutell.org. The 2017 conference will include a plenary session, at least 4 19 workshops, scientific poster presentations, personal stories, arts and networking opportunities. We expect an 20 attendance of 400 at this conference. A special workshop will target junior minority researchers to promote 21 mentoring and build capacity for stigma research. The conference will be broadcast live via webcast and the 22 lectures/workshops will be archived on our website. Specific AIMS for the conference are: 1.) Describe the 23 impact of stigma on patient outcomes and present research in the field of HIV-related and other health- 24 related stigma, including research tools to monitor stigma and evaluate interventions. 2.) Conduct a 25 workshop providing guidance and mentoring for researchers at early stages of development and for under- 26 represented minorities to pursue research and funding on health-related stigma. 3.)

"9563345","TR&D1:RotatingFrameMRITechniques:  ExchangeMediatedImagingBiomarkers   P.I: Ravinder Reddy, PhD  Co-investigators:  Ravi Prakash Nanga PhD, Catherine DeBrosse BS, Arijitt Borthakur PhD, and Hari Hariharan PhD  ABSTRACT   The major barriers for progress in the field of biomedicine are limitations of existing methods in  detecting and quantifying molecular changes during preclinical stages of disease. In this TR&D, as  emphasized by several compelling collaborative projects, we propose to develop and optimize several  molecular MRI biomarkers based primarily on chemical exchange phenomenon.   The primary advantage of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) methods is that, depending  upon the rates of exchangeable spins, they inherently have an order of magnitude or greater sensitivity  advantage over conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In the previous funding period, we  have developed several amine and hydroxyl group based CEST imaging techniques to measure endogenous  metabolites from brain, skeletal muscle, heart and cartilage. While we have made significant progress, as  demonstrated by the number of publications, the methods developed so far have been limited to single slice  imaging with long acquisition times and suboptimal corrections of field inhomogeneities that preclude their  broader application.   To address these issues, in this competing proposal, we will develop and optimize 3D CEST imaging  methods for amine and hydroxyl CEST imaging, with built-in provisions for radiofrequency and static field  inhomogeneity measurements. Custom designed saturation pulses integrated with different 3D readout  strategies will be investigated to determine the optimal method for a given application. In order to improve the  temporal resolution we will also develop and optimize methods for integrated single shot z-spectrum from  localized regions of tissues and evaluate its feasibility in measuring amine and hydroxyl CEST effect from  different organs. Finally, we will design and evaluate a method based on the transverse relaxation (T1? and T2)  enhancement by intermediate to fast exchanging systems (TRACE) and compare its performance with the  conventional CEST in terms of sensitivity and temporal resolution. Successful accomplishment of these aims  will lead to imaging-based biomarkers that are noninvasive and nonradioactive, with high spatial and temporal  resolution. These biomarkers will aid in study of pathologies associated with neurodegeneration,  neuropsychiatric disorders, oncology, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal disease, thereby contributing to  fundamental understanding and improved health care."
"9322031","PROJECT SUMMARY: The White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) have partnered successfully on NARCH I, III, V, VI, VII, and VIII. Each NARCH application has included an integrated focus on training and community driven research which has deepened our understanding of local and cross-tribal health disparities, produced new public health solutions and added to the continuous development of our innovative training model that combines student and faculty development. Overall goals of the WMAT-JHU NARCH IX initiative are to: 1) increase the pool of trained American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) scientists and research professionals; 2) strengthen our partnership with JHU and other research institutions through innovative CBPR projects and learning across WMA and western cultural and scientific knowledge and world views; and 3) field innovative, strengths-based and culturally driven research to combat major AI/AN health disparities. The WMAT-JHU NARCH IX application includes four components to meet these goals: 1) a student and faculty development project that will integrate academic and field-based research training, and 2) three NARCH research projects targeting substance abuse, suicide and STIs--leading Apache and other AI/AN health disparities. The research projects are designed to provide a supportive, multi-disciplined platform for training AI investigators on broad scientific research methods and will contribute new cultural and scientific understanding to protective factor-based intervention development and outcomes in AI/AN settings. Apache scientists will build skills in: biomedical and behavioral sciences, qualitative and quantitative research methods, culturally grounded development and deep structure adaptation of strengths-based evidence-informed interventions; and, rigorous, culturally competent evaluation approaches. The studies are built upon previous NARCH research findings, will apply innovative methods and approaches, and tap cultural and community assets to address major AI health disparities across the lifespan with potential for intergenerational impact. Activities have been selected and will be guided by the existing White Mountain Apache NARCH Community Advisory Board."
"9448400","ABSTRACT Like humans, mice subjected to stress can be divided into two phenotypes. Susceptible animals succumb to maladaptive symptoms such as anhedonia and social avoidance, while resilient animals continue to behave indistinguishably from controls. The mechanisms that drive this divergent stress-response remain elusive. Understanding the functional relationship between individual variability in functional and structural connectivity and stress-response is a critical first step in early identification of at-risk individuals and preventative approaches that actively enhance resilience. We will address this relationship at multiple scales of resolution: the whole-brain functional connectivity level using cFos co-activation mapping, the mesoscale structural connectome level using viral-mediated trans-synaptic tracing, the synaptic level using single-cell 3D reconstruction of dendritic spines, and the circuit level using viral-mediated identification and chemogenetic control of a corticolimbic pathway. Multiscale circuits will be studied using a ?time-course? approach, which will provide mechanistic insight into how the functional and structural wiring diagram prior to a stressor contributes to the development of divergent stress-responses. Our behavioral toolbox includes acute and chronic social defeat stress resulting in subpopulations of resilient and susceptible mice, and novel non-stressful predictors of each phenotype. In our preliminary studies, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and its input from the prelimbic cortex (PL), two regions involved in emotional regulation, have emerged as key players mediating divergent stress-responses. In Aim 1, we will define the contribution of individual variability in BLA connectivity prior to stress-exposure to BLA functional and structural reorganization during acute stress. In Aim 2, we will assess if individual variability in functional and structural BLA connectivity becomes exacerbated following chronic stress. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that circuit rewiring prior to stress-exposure can alter future stress- responses."
"9330527","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a need to understand how the results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the U.S. Pre- ventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines will impact the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening in the general population. Given the high incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer, developing evidence on the utility of a screening test that can reduce lung cancer mortality will likely lead to a significant improvement in public health. Our long-term goal is to examine the delivery, quality and outcomes of lung cancer screening in North Carolina by utilizing prospective population-based lung cancer screening data that captures patient, radiologist, and pathology information to inform clinical practice. The objective of this application is to evaluate the extent to which disparities in intermediate lung cancer screening outcomes exist. We plan to accomplish this objective by pursuing the following four specific aims: (1) Deter- mine the agreement between radiologists' use of the lung imaging reporting and data system (Lung-RADS) assessment code and follow-up recommendations with the American College of Radiology (ACR) guidelines; (2) Evaluate recall rates of lung cancer screening with LDCT by patient socio-demographics and risk factors; (3) Compare rates of follow-up receipt after a positive lung cancer screening test result by patient socio- demographics and risk factors; (4) Perform a data linkage between lung cancer screening data and lung can- cer outcomes from the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (NCCCR) to examine false positive rates. With the USPSTF recommending LDCT for lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals, there is a growing need to monitor the screening experience as academic centers and community practices begin to adopt this technolo- gy. This is an innovative study that uses established methods in population-based registry development to ex- plore an emerging clinically relevant cancer screening area for which limited data exist. The proposed research is significant because it will provide evidence on lung cancer screening with LDCT in a general population to inform the delivery, quality, and outcomes of lung cancer screening as it diffuses into clinical practice."

A new cancer research career development program at SCSU and MUSC-HCC will also be implemented for junior faculty who are interested in establishing independent careers in cancer disparities research. Within the Research Education Core, the SC CADRE undergraduate and junior faculty Scholars will interact as they participate in coursework and/or career development programming, weekly SC CADRE Research Club meetings, monthly seminar series, and an annual SC CADRE Cancer Health Equity Research Symposium. Through the Research Education Core, SCSU will hire two new junior faculty Scholars and MUSC-HCC will hire one new junior faculty Scholar, all of whom will be early-stage investigators (ESIs). Both levels of Scholars will actively engage in numerous SC CADRE enrichment activities and activities planned by the Community Outreach Core, which will work directly with Research Education Core leadership to s t r e s s the importance of community engagement in developing, conducting, and disseminating cancer disparities research."
"9333457","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Episodic memory is defined as the type of explicit memory in which aspects of an event are integrated together and associated with the context in which they occur. Deficiency in episodic memory can be devastating to everyday functions, and is a symptom ubiquitous across many neurological disorders. Interestingly, patients with difficulty in episodic memory function may also exhibit difficulty segmenting continuous information into meaningful events. Recently it has been shown in healthy adults that episodic memory performance and event segmentation ability are not independent measures. An ongoing representation of context is critical for appropriate recognition of novelty and event segmentation has been shown to influence memory organization. In addition, event segmentation can induce top-down processes to modulate novelty responses and expectations. The purpose of this proposal is to understand event segmentation and its relationship to episodic memory. This will help to inform the dependencies between these processes in healthy adults and may also have implications for patients with neurological disorders who exhibit deficiencies in these functions. We will examine these processes using electrocorticography, functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral measures, motivated by predictions of a computational neural network model of episodic memory. We will characterize how event structure and segmentation impact brain activity while information is being presented and during subsequent memory retrieval, as well as how they impact which information is remembered and how that information is organized in memory."

"9302754","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiological and clinical studies have found that cholesterol gallstones are more prevalent in women than in men at all ages in every population studied. Accumulated evidence shows that the use of oral contraceptives and conjugated estrogens in women significantly increases the prevalence of gallstones. Estrogen therapy to men with prostatic cancer also leads to similar lithogenic effects. These findings clearly demonstrate that the increased risk of developing gallstones in women compared to men is related to differences in how the liver metabolizes cholesterol in response to estrogen. Our published studies have established a critical role for estrogen in enhancing cholelithogenesis by activating the classical estrogen receptor ? (ER?), but not ER? in the liver. However, the mechanisms mediating estrogen's lithogenic actions on gallstone formation have become more complicated with the identification of a novel estrogen receptor, the G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30). Our genetic findings support the candidacy of GPR30 as a compelling gene underlying a new gallstone gene Lith18. However, identifying the lithogenic mechanisms of GPR30 has been a focal point of interest because it is still unknown whether GPR30 plays a major role in estrogen-induced gallstones and whether it acts independently of or in conjunction with ER? on inducing gallstone formation. We hypothesize that GPR30 is also involved in estrogen-dependent lithogenic actions, working independently of ER?, as both GPR30 and ER? can work through different pathways to promote the formation of estrogen-induced gallstones. This hypothesis is based on our new preliminary data showing that fed a lithogenic diet for 8 wk, ovariectomized GPR30(+/+)/ER?(-/-) mice still form gallstones in response to high doses of estrogen. By contrast, the prevalence of gallstones is significantly reduced in estrogen-treated GPR30(-/-)/ER?(-/-) mice compared to GPR30(+/+)/ER?(+/+) mice. Therefore, we plan to accomplish our goals by pursuing the following three specific aims: First, we will investigate the phenotypic characterization of GPR30 that determines susceptibility to cholesterol cholelithiasis. Second, we will study whether the activation of GPR30 leads to the lithogenesis of bile by inhibiting hepatic bile acid synthesis through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway in response to high levels of estrogen. Third, we will elucidate the critical role of GPR30 in hepatic hypersecretion of biliary cholesterol and gallbladder hypomotility that accounts for rapid growth of cholesterol crystals. The proposed studies are innovative both conceptually and in the implementation of experimental approaches because distinguishing the lithogenic actions of GPR30 from those of ER? and further investigating how estrogen produces lithogenic actions through GPR30 will elucidate all the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of estrogen-induced gallstones. The planned experimental strategies are comprehensive, yet feasible. This project will help us gain novel mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of estrogen-induced gallstones through GPR30 or ER? or both."

"9569801","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic pain affects more than 100 million people in the United States and produces annual costs up to $635 billion. While pain affects all segments of the population, the burden of chronic pain and associated disability disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Blacks (?Blacks?) compared to non-Hispanic Whites (?Whites?) as well as individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) compared to those with high SES. Blacks often experience more frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to Whites. Further, SES factors, such as lower levels of education, low income, and unemployment are associated with higher rates of chronic and disabling pain. Despite growing documentation of racial differences in chronic pain outcomes, relatively little research has focused on differences in the experience of chronic low back pain (cLBP) between Blacks and Whites in a socioeconomic context. This is concerning because cLBP is one of the most prevalent and severely disabling painful conditions, yet it remains unclear whether specific disadvantaged subgroups of society such as Blacks with low SES may be at heightened risk for poor cLBP outcomes. The proposed hypotheses are based on the theory of fundamental causes as a socioeconomic framework for explaining why cLBP severity and disability, as well as the factors predicting these outcomes, may differ as a function of racial background. Guided by the theory of fundamental causes, the overall aim of this study is to characterize racial and SES differences in cLBP severity and disability. Further, we aim to examine important biopsychosocial predictors of racial and SES differences in cLBP outcomes. To explore this overall aim, we will first characterize racial and SES differences in cLBP clinical symptoms, perceived disability, and functional performance. Next, we will invoke endogenous pain inhibitory and facilitatory processes using quantitative sensory tests of conditioned pain modulation and temporal summation, respectively. Biologically-driven factors including sleep, vitamin D, oxytocin, and C-reactive protein, in addition to psychosocial factors including depressive symptoms, racial discrimination, perceived injustice, access to social support, and psychological resilience will then be assessed. We will determine whether endogenous pain modulatory processes, as well as important biopsychosocial factors differentially predict cLBP outcomes for Blacks and Whites, and whether the strength of prediction varies according to SES. This study will be the first to directly and comprehensively apply a socioeconomic framework to the study of racial differences in cLBP outcomes. The findings will also provide novel and important information regarding biopsychosocial predictors of racial and SES differences in clinical pain responses and related disability among those with cLBP. Whether these biopsychosocial predictors may subsequently serve as viable treatment targets for cLBP tailored to meet the specific needs of disadvantaged population subgroups can then be addressed in future research."
"9436415","Project Summary Depression is an important problem after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and evidence-based treatments are lacking. To develop new treatments and to target existing therapies to appropriate individuals, it is important to understand the longitudinal trajectories of depression following TBI as well as its relationship to person characteristics, injury characteristics, and situational factors. This project will use a large (n = 2,330) cohort from the Traumatic Brain Injury Model System National Database: participants who have completed the PHQ-9 measure of depressive symptoms at 1 and 2 years after injury. Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) will be used to characterize subgroups of patients that differ in the association (joint trajectory) between depression and societal participation over time. In secondary analyses we will explore the specific contributions of three sub-types of participation: social relations, community activity, and productivity. The ultimate aim of this research is to elucidate for whom depression follows limitations in valued activity, for whom the reverse relationship might occur, and what other factors bear on the relationship between participation and depression following TBI. New knowledge about contributors to depression after TBI will lead directly to the development of treatments, or adaptation of treatments with a strong evidence base for depression in the general population, targeted to the persons most likely to benefit.

"9449965","Impact of prevalence of P. gingivalis and S. cristatus in oral health disparities  Adult periodontitis is disproportionally distributed among races, and has a significantly higher incidence in  African Americans (AA) compared to European Caucasians (EC), even when co-variants such as diabetes and  other health and social factors have been taken into account. This proposal examines the potential role of two  oral microbial biofilm components (P. gingivalis and S. cristatus) on this disparity. Titers to the oral pathogen P.  gingivalis are reported to be higher in dentate subjects with, compared to those without periodontitis. Our  laboratory was the first to report an intergeneric communication between S. cristatus and P. gingivalis. We  identified a surface protein of S. cristatus, arginine deiminase (ArcA) that serves as a signal molecule to which  P. gingivalis responds by repressing the expression of the fimA gene, which codes for the major subunit  protein of long fimbriae. The latter is required for bacterial colonization of P. gingivalis and host cell invasion.  Recently, we demonstrated that S. cristatus indeed inhibited colonization of P. gingivalis in the murine oral  cavity and reduced periodontal bone loss in those mice tested. Therefore, we hypothesize that colonization of  P. gingivalis is dependent upon the nature of the initial streptococcal biofilm, and that certain as yet unidentified  risk factors of periodontitis are the driving force behind different streptococcal profiles of these initial microbial  biofilms. We will first compare the prevalence of S. cristatus versus P. gingivalis in the oral cavities of  periodontally healthy AAs, ECs and Mexican Americans (MA) versus those with periodontitis (before and after  periodontal treatments). Our objective is to determine if there is a link between a lower prevalence ratio of oral  S. cristatus:P. gingivalis in AAs, or MAs compared to ECs, which might help account for the higher risk of  periodontitis in AAs and MAs. We will also then test the potential involvement of other periodontal risk factors  in this disparity, and their role in the prevalence of S. cristatus versus P. gingivalis. Finally, we propose to  investigate if intense education of periodontal health will promote a shift in ratio of S. cristatus versus P.  gingivalis in periodontitis patients. We anticipate that the proposed studies will provide important information  regarding the pathogenesis of periodontitis and the nature of the microbial biofilms found in different  races/ethnics, and will pave the way for extended studies in future, focused on the development of appropriate  interventional strategies targeted at eliminating of P. gingivalis colonization."
"9335872","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The objective of the proposed research is to develop new technology for a Wearable Robotic Object Manipulation Aid (W-ROMA) for the visually impaired. The W-ROMA is a hand-worn assistive device that provides assistance to a visually impaired individual in effectively grasping an object. Thanks to the onboard computer vision methods, the W-ROMA is capable of detecting a target object, determining the hand-object misalignment, and conveying to the wearer, via natural human-device interfaces, the desired hand motion for hand-object alignment. The W-ROMA will contribute to the independent lives of the visually impaired in twofold: First, it helps the visually impaired with independent travel by enabling them to identify a movable obstacle and manipulate the obstacle to make a passage. Second, it assists the visually impaired in effectively grasping an object for non-navigational purpose. The PIs will involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the project and use the proposed project activities to recruit and retain engineering students. The proposal's Intellectual Merit is the development of new computer vision and human-robot interaction methods that support accurate and effective object grasping for the visually impaired for their independent daily lives. These methods include: (1) a new real-time object recognition method; (2) an innovative hand-object alignment mechanism; (3) a novel hybrid tactile display system for object shape rendering; and (4) a computationally efficient device localization method. The proposed solutions can be encapsulated in a hand-worn robotic device. The W-ROMA will provide new co-robotic functions for the visually impaired. The PIs have performed proof of concept studies for the computer vision and tactile display methods and the results are promising. The broader impacts include: (1) the research will positively impact the large visually impaired community; (2) the proposed methods can be applied to other small robotic systems that have a wide range of applications in military surveillance, law enforcement, and search and rescue; and (3) the project will improve the research infrastructure of the PI's university and train graduate and undergraduate students for their future careers in science and engineering."
"9241773","Abstract Every day, individuals with acute serious illness face critical decisions about their medical care and use of life- sustaining treatments. These decisions regarding resuscitation, invasive procedures, or artificial nutrition are the key determinants of whether an individual will survive with functional limitations or transition to palliative care and end-of-life. While these decisions occur across the spectrum of disease, individuals with acute neurological disease such as stroke face several unique challenges due to the unexpected onset of disease, reliance on surrogate decision makers, and variability in outcome. Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death and a leading cause of adult disability in the US. There is currently dramatic variability in the use of life-sustaining treatments after stroke, with up to 40% of early mortality attributable to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. We have identified substantial inconsistencies in how physicians estimate and communicate stroke prognosis, raising the possibility that these communication differences may be in part responsible for the considerable variability observed in stroke end-of-life treatment. These inconsistencies may also be responsible for mismatches between patient values and the treatment plan. Currently, there is a critical gap in our understanding of how to help surrogates make treatment decisions consistent with patient values while minimizing adverse effects on the surrogate. Decision support tools, specifically recommended in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been shown to improve the quality of decisions and reduce burden on the decision maker in multiple clinical settings, yet almost none have focused on use of life-sustaining treatments in acute serious illness such as stroke. We propose a comprehensive frame shift in how the health care team and surrogates collaborate on decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments for acute illness, by developing a tailored web-based stroke decision support intervention based on a well-established theoretical framework for decision support. This web-based tool will be developed for surrogate decision makers to use during the acute stroke hospitalization, with the goals of facilitating high quality patient-centered decisions and minimizing adverse effects on the surrogate. The project aims are 1) To develop a tailored web-based decision support intervention to prepare stroke surrogates to make decisions on use of life sustaining treatments; and 2) To pilot test the tailored decision support intervention in surrogate decision makers of hospitalized stroke patients. Key features of the tool will include an advanced statistical prognostic calculator that presents customized outcome data in a tailored and accessible fashion; an exercise to assist the surrogate in clarifying values most important to the patient, and questions to ask the health care team to empower surrogates to communicate more effectively. Information obtained in this R21 is critically important to the development of a novel tool that can be tested in a future definitive R01 study in order to better match treatment plans to patient wishes, reduce adverse outcomes among surrogates, and limit unwanted variability in end-of life treatment."
"9351515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this Program is to determine the vulnerabilities of the HIV-1 Env protein cell entry machine as a target for disease intervention by identifying Env inhibitors, defining their structural mechanisms of action, and using a structure-mechanism framework as a guide to optimize antagonist functions. Inhibition of the initial entry of HIV-1 into host cells remains a compelling, yet elusive means to prevent infection and spread of the virus. Inhibitors of HIV-1 Env that can either block cell interactions,  inactivate the trimeric virus spike protein complex before receptor encounter or disrupt receptor-induced conformational changes in the Env would hold great promise of inhibiting initial HIV-1 infection. Such inhibitors would provide virus-targeted molecular weapons both to prevent AIDS transmission, a global health priority, and to treat already-infected individuals. In spite of the great potential of Env inhibitors for AIDS intervention, structural complexity and polymorphisms of the Env proteins have presented significant challenges to progress. Nonetheless, the efforts of our Program have led to the development of two classes of Env gp120 inhibitors that utilize the highly conserved CD4 binding site, but with very different modes of action. Investigation of these inhibitors has defined unique pathways to engage the virus Env trimer and cause both inactivation of the virus and blockade of virus entry into the host cell. Our Program is ideally positioned to take advantage of these new results through state-of-the-art structure- and mechanism-based approaches, achieved by the collaborative nature of our multi-institutional research team, with strong expertise in high-resolution structure determination, structural dynamics, kinetic, thermodynamic and structural mechanisms of protein-protein interactions, chemical design and synthesis, computational methods, and virology. We will apply this team approach to structure-based design and mechanistic investigations of inhibitor chemotypes that we have already developed, and new inhibitor chemotypes as they are discovered in our own and other laboratories. Overall, the Program will provide a broad-based research infrastructure to identify new paths for the discovery of preventive and therapeutic agents that block HIV-1 Env function."
"9253587","Abstract Opsidio LLC is commercializing a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that will prevent and treat chronic kidney disease (CKD) that can lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD) and dialysis or kidney transplantation. At the present time, there is no known therapy for CKD that can alter the progression to end stage kidney failure. The CDC estimates that there are 20 million adult patients with CKD in the US and the cost of disease treatment is over $40 billion per year. The quality of life for patients with CKD or ESRD is compromised with patients feeling sick and tired, frequent doctor visits and tests, numerous medications, and dietary restrictions. Opsidio has licensed the patent for a MAb specific for a disease-associated form of Stem Cell Factor (SCF) from the University of Michigan. SCF stimulates two kinds of immune cells, mast cells and eosinophils, to produce hormones that drive chronic tissue remodeling and fibrosis, a process in which normal tissue is replaced by scar tissue. This process is especially relevant in CKD, where the amount of SCF present has been correlated to severity of kidney disease, and the degree of fibrosis and mast cell accumulation in the kidney. The design of the antibody allows it to bind only to the disease associated SCF248, and not the other forms of SCF that maintain normal functions. Opsidio has generated preliminary data that supports the hypothesis that SCF contributes to human CKD. The focus for this phase 1 STTR will be to validate in animal models of CKD that the monoclonal antibody that is specific for the SCF248 form can arrest and possibly reverse the fibrosis that is the cause of renal failure. In addition, we will use a large collection of blood, urine and kidney biopsy samples from human patients with various types of kidney disease to show that levels of SCF248 are correlated with the severity of human CKD. An animal model that resembles human disease will be performed with a subcontract to kidney researchers at the University of Michigan. They will demonstrate that the MAb can prevent or treat the decline in kidney function. The second major goal of this phase 1 STTR will be the analyses of data from a large clinical cohort (NEPTUNE) that is already established at the University of Michigan with ~600 human CKD patients to further demonstrate that SCF levels correlate to disease severity and progression of human CKD. The demonstration that 1) blocking the abnormal form of SCF prevents or reverses CKD in an animal model, and 2) that the same mechanism of abnormal SCF driving CKD is operative in humans with known CKD will provide strong evidence for Opsidio, LLC to continue the development of these MAbs directed against SCF248, and progress to a phase 2 STTR with a strong commercialization plan. The ultimate goal of Opsidio, LLC is to commercialize the anti-SCF248 monoclonal antibody as a drug that can stabilize or reverse renal fibrosis in human CKD patients."
"9567706","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dorsal closure in Drosophila is a key model system for cell sheet movements during development and wound healing. During closure two sheets of lateral epidermis advance to close a dorsal opening. Forces for closure are produced by a unique array of actomyosin in the leading edges of each sheet of lateral epidermis and by two distinct arrays of actomyosin in the amnioserosa, which fills the dorsal opening. Supra-cellular actomyosin rich purse strings (PSs) provide tension in the leading edges (leading edge cells oscillate during the bulk of closure, then shorten as they are zipped into the canthi). In the amnioserosa, junctional belts (JBs) and apical medial arrays (AMAs) drive both oscillations in cell shape and then ingression when individual cells apically constrict and drop out of the plane of the amnioserosa. This proposal focuses on how these actomyosin arrays generate force, how force generation is regulated and on identifying the molecular players that characterize the cells that contribute to both processes. We use high-resolution confocal imaging of genetically encoded fluorophore-fusions in living embryos coupled with laser surgical, mechanical jump protocols to interrogate mutant, drug-treated and wildtype specimens. Confocal images are segmented and digitally analyzed. Biophysical reasoning is used to develop quantitative models that describe our results, make testable hypotheses and refine models for further rounds of experiment and analysis. We also implement new candidate and systems approaches to identify the molecular players that characterize the cells that contribute to closure. We seek answers to key extant questions about dorsal closure and morphogenesis in other cell sheets:  How are forces produced at the cell and molecular level?  How are such forces regulated?  Which transcripts/proteins are present in the cells that drive closure? These studies are at the next frontier in understanding morphogenesis in dorsal closure and in the myriad of other systems that require apical constrictions for powering changes in cell sheet morphology."

"9465797","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can occur as a result of dysfunction of outer hair cells, inner hair cells, auditory-nerve fibers or synapses. However, standard clinical techniques are limited in their ability to differentiate these dysfunctions because they focus on threshold elevation and thus provide insufficient information about suprathreshold auditory dysfunction, which has greater ecological validity than threshold elevation. SNHL that does not elevate thresholds, and therefore would be missed by standard clinical techniques, is sometimes referred to as ?hidden hearing loss? (HHL). Recent animal studies suggest that noise-induced synaptopathy may underlie HHL and may be the cause of suprathreshold hearing deficits, such as difficulty understanding speech in noise. However, there is limited research to support the diagnosis of HHL in humans beyond reports that some individuals have suprathreshold hearing deficits that cannot be predicted from their audiograms. Understanding HHL in humans will require the use of measurements of auditory function that are specific to the location of the dysfunction in the auditory pathway, including the specific group of auditory-nerve fibers (low vs. high spontaneous-rate fibers) underlying the dysfunction. The long-term goals of this research program are to improve our understanding of suprathreshold hearing deficits and to develop intervention strategies that ameliorate these deficits. The immediate goal of this proposal is to establish a theoretical framework for the development of diagnostic methods for HHL in humans. Unfortunately, a ?gold standard? does not exist because synaptopathy cannot be directly observed in humans. Consequently, our approach is to develop a statistical model of HHL that describes the relationship and interdependence between specific behavioral and physiological measures of auditory function that are thought to be indicative of HHL and measures that reflect the functional integrity of sites along the auditory pathway. The goal will be achieved by pursuing three aims: (1) Develop a statistical model of HHL for individuals with normal hearing, (2) Develop a statistical model of HHL for individuals with clinical hearing loss caused by noise exposure, and (3) Validate a predictive model of HHL and demonstrate its relation to speech understanding in noise. We will establish a functional definition of HHL as a component of the variability in measures impacted by HHL that is not due to audiometric threshold. We will then create a statistical model that relates this estimate of HHL to measures that reflect sites of dysfunction along the auditory pathway. Through the aims, we will test the hypothesis that HHL accounts for some of the variability in suprathreshold measures of auditory function. The proposed research will lead to evidence-based models of suprathreshold auditory dysfunction that are capable of predicting hearing deficits, provide further insights into suprathreshold auditory deficits and improve our understanding of potential mechanisms underlying hearing and listening difficulties. The ability to diagnose HHL in the clinic will usher in new methods for clinical evaluation and may lead to better remediation techniques of hearing loss."
"9358883","Abstract  Klebsiella pneumoniae is a persistent human pathogen that is responsible for severe healthcare-associated infections. The bacterium is commonly found associated with indwelling medical devices and hospital surfaces due to its ability to form a resilient biofilm. In susceptible patients, chronic carriage profoundly complicates hospitalization procedures, necessitating enhanced isolation measures to prevent the dissemination of the pathogen in healthcare environments. All of this is ongoing during the emergence of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) that are unaffected by most available antibiotics. Both the Centers for Disease Control and the NIH have concluded that this situation poses an urgent threat to public health, and must be immediately addressed via development of new therapies. This proposal focuses on the main virulence factor that K. pneumoniae possesses: robust production of a polysaccharide capsule that allows it to efficiently colonize patients. The synthesis of this capsule is regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay, a multicomponent signaling pathway conserved in all Enterobacteriaceae that involves at least one essential gene. Previous knowledge of this pathway gained in E. coli will inform the analysis of Rcs in K. pneumoniae. E. coli and K. pneumoniae Rcs component structures will be investigated with the help of collaborating crystallographers, and downstream gene regulation will be assessed in both organisms. In addition, an in- vivo fluorescent reporter assay has been developed to examine the ability of small molecules to interfere with the Rcs phosphorelay. This will facilitate novel antibiotic design against Rcs in a high-throughput format. Finally, genetic investigation in K. pneumoniae is relatively primitive. Development of efficient genetic tools in this bacterium is necessary to make chromosomal mutations and to create appropriate reporter constructs to assess the biology of the Rcs pathway as drug target. Any progress made in Klebsiella genome editing using CRISPR or recombineering will be a benefit to the scientific community. These studies will inform the design of novel antibiotics against virulent, drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae. This proposal addresses a central part of the mission of NIH: to both evaluate bacteria for new drug targets and to create the next generation of antimicrobials."

"9445530","Project Summary: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., accounting for 158,040 deaths in 2015. While targeted therapies of lung adenocarcinoma have improved overall survival, similar advances in lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) have been stagnant. Extensive molecular profiling through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) effort revealed that LUSC tumors are highly idiosyncratic and rarely driven by solitary actionable pathways. However, the tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes the metastasis that accounts for 90 percent of cancer-related deaths, remains an attractive target for immune-based therapies. Recently, the blockade of immune checkpoints with anti-Programed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antibodies has demonstrated remarkable therapeutic promise in LUSC patients, with about 20% of unselected patients experiencing durable responses. Thus, a more complete understanding of how the tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes LUSC will allow us to build upon these advances. Using updated TCGA data for LUSC, we have uncovered a previously unidentified subset of LUSC characterized by infiltration of inflammatory monocytes (IMs). This subset accounts for nearly half of all LUSC patients, is associated with very poor outcome, and has numerous signatures of immune evasion. Using immune-competent metastasis models of LUSC developed in our lab, we have found that the CCL2-CCR2 axis is highly associated with IM recruitment and promotion of LUSC metastasis. Although studies in other cancer types have revealed IMs differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which in turn leads to increased angiogenesis and invasiveness, very little is known about the direct role of IMs on LUSC growth and metastasis. Taken together, we hypothesize that specific molecular processes (i) recruit IMs into the LUSC tumor microenvironment, which (ii) directly promotes LUSC tumor growth and development of distant metastasis, and (iii) interruption of the CCL2-CCR2 axis will therapeutically inhibit these processes. In Aim 1, we will determine and characterize the upstream molecular drivers responsible for IM recruitment into the LUSC microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will determine the direct role of IMs in promoting LUSC tumor growth and metastasis. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting IMs in immune-competent metastasis models of LUSC, and whether this therapeutic approach is synergistic in combination with anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, taken together, our proposal aims to uncover the molecular underpinnings that promote IM infiltration into the LUSC TME, define the mechanisms by which this promotes LUSC progression, and to develop novel therapeutic strategies to interrupt these processes."
"9507598","Project Summary/Abstract Exercise is an effective intervention for both the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases, but the mechanistic underpinnings of the health benefits of exercise remain incompletely defined. Recent work highlights the importance of inter-organ circuits in mediating healthful exercise responses. We identified ?- aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) as a novel small molecule ?myokine? that increases the expression of brown adipocyte-specific genes in vitro, and improves glucose disposal and decreases weight gain in mice. In humans, plasma BAIBA concentrations are increased with chronic exercise and demonstrate a strong inverse association with metabolic risk factors. Our team has also been a leader in characterizing within-tissue responses to exercise and dietary interventions. These experiences, coupled with the high translational relevance of the research problem, motivate us to take a systems wide approach to studying the health benefits of exercise in humans and animal models. To this end, we have formed a multi-institutional, multi-omics center to engage in collaborative studies under the aegis of the NIH MoTrPAC initiative. Our core builds upon ongoing collaborations between teams at Duke, Harvard and the Broad Institute with complementary strengths in metabolomics and proteomics technologies and decades of experience in cardiometabolic research. The core will provide a deep menu of analytical tools for targeted and non-targeted metabolomics, protein profiling, and the analysis of key protein post-translational modifications. Each of the core components has a track record for handling large sample sets, and is well- poised to analyze the expected tens of thousands of tissue and blood samples generated by a national consortium of investigators studying exercise interventions in animal and human cohorts. An additional distinction of our team is the ability to integrate new findings from MoTrPAC with previously collected genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data from large human cohorts. We hypothesize that integrating the metabolomic and proteomic profiles of human tissues and blood during exercise with genetics and detailed human phenotyping will provide novel insights into the inter-organ circuits and within-organ responses that mediate the salutary effects of exercise. All of the primary data generated by this multi- disciplinary proposal will be made rapidly available to the scientific community via a novel information portal at the Broad Institute. Importantly, all four leaders of this proposed core (Carr, Clish, Gerszten and Newgard) have strong track records in the use of metabolomics and proteomics tools for the identification of novel cardiometabolic regulatory and disease mechanisms. These experiences position this proposed core as one that can have maximal impact on the generation, analysis, and interpretation of molecular profiling data."

The second specific aim will concentrate on developing a method for aligning each patient's head for testing all canals and clinical software integrated to hardware with the test protocol in the commercially-available VEST? software. The third specific aim will focus on clinical testing. Total population to be enrolled in this study: 120 controls and 66 patients for a total study cohort of 186 subjects. 66 patients will include: 30 with surgically confirmed unilateral loss for validation, 15 with absent ice water calorics from vestibular neuritis, and 21 with diagnosed vestibular migraine for evaluation sensitivity and specificity of test. During clinical testing we also plan to evaluate subject's discomfort with these stimuli. The focus of the current experiments will be to obtain an evaluation of general comfort level and the potential for the vertical crHIT stimuli to evoke motion sickness symptoms. After testing and data analysis are complete we will submit results of testing to the FDA for 510K clearance (specific aim #4). FDA approval will allow us to commercially sell the vertical crHIT test to vestibular and concussion clinics. Specific aim #5 is the final report."
"9534352","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High Throughput Single-Cell Phenotype Isolation by Protrusion Analysis Chip (PAC) There is increasing evidence that solid tumors are likely comprised of many subpopulations of cells with distinct genotypes and phenotypes, which is a phenomenon termed intratumor heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity becomes a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment and personalized medicine. Because of this inherent heterogeneity, data collected from cancer cell population-averaged assays likely hides valuable but rare events such as dramatic variations in gene expression at the single cell level. Therefore, understanding cellular heterogeneity from cancer biospecimens, especially in the study of phenotype-genotype correlation, will facilitate identification of new cell subsets, and assist in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. In this proposal, we focus on developing a high throughput approach for single-cell isolation based on cells' capability in generating protrusions. To be able to retrieve the desired single adherent cell, a Protrusion Analysis Chip (PAC) is proposed, in which the single cell is captured by a single hook and physically isolated by a barrier. The PAC is rapid, operationally simple, highly efficient, and requires low-volume sample introduction. After adhesion and spreading, cell phenotype is identified microscopically and then the desired cell is retrieved for genotype analysis. The proposed technology developments and study plans may potentially strengthen the understanding of the relationship between phenotype and genotype at the single cell level."

"9331968","PROJECT SUMMARY Chromatin is the eukaryotic complex of DNA with proteins that regulates transcription, replication and repair through dynamic changes in its structure. The DNA in chromatin is packaged into repeating nucleosome building blocks, with each nucleosome consisting of ~147 bp of DNA wrapped nearly twice around a histone protein octamer containing two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. All histones contain disordered N-terminal tail domains, corresponding to ~15-30% of their amino acid sequences, that protrude out from each nucleosome. The N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 are essential regulators of chromatin function. These domains interact with DNA and other histones to mediate chromatin compaction, recruit numerous chromatin regulatory factors, and have their functions regulated by various post-translational modifications (PTMs). While the atomic structure of the nucleosome and arrangements of nucleosomes within evenly spaced arrays representative of chromatin fibers have been resolved by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, the histone N-terminal tails have escaped high-resolution characterization in densely packed nucleosome arrays. The latter is due to their intrinsic disorder coupled with the fact that they are an integral part of large multi-megadalton protein-DNA assemblies. To address these challenges and directly investigate histone tail domains in chromatin at physiological concentrations, we have applied magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to recombinant nucleosome arrays reconstituted with 13C,15N- enriched histones. Our initial published high-resolution MAS NMR studies revealed that N-terminal domains of histones H3 and H4 are conformationally flexible even in highly condensed chromatin. These findings strongly suggest that histone tails do not act as static tethers to compact chromatin and recruit PTM-binding proteins and have caused us to reevaluate their function in chromatin. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that modulation of the dynamic histone tail conformational landscapes functions to regulate their interactions within chromatin while remaining accessible to chromatin regulatory complexes. To investigate this hypothesis we will pursue the following three aims: (1) determine the influence of higher order chromatin structure regulatory factors on histone tail conformation and dynamics, (2) determine how acetylation of histone H4 lysine 16 regulates chromatin compaction, and (3) determine the regulation of H3 tail conformation and dynamics by trimethyl lysine 36 and PHF1. The proposed studies will provide the first high-resolution insights into involvement of H3 and H4 tails in critical events that regulate transcription including chromatin compaction and recruitment of an essential PTM-binding protein, and are highly significant for understanding the function of histone tails in chromatin. Finally, these studies will provide an important foundation for future work on key histone PTM-binding complexes in native chromatin environment."
"9274853","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     United States military Veterans from recent conflicts are coping with symptoms related to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), persistent post concussive (PPC) symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many Veterans are resistant to conventional health and mental health interventions (e.g., medication, psychotherapy), and often symptoms are not significantly improved by traditional treatments. Moreover, there are limited treatments for symptoms associated with both conditions, which frequently co-occur. Alternative treatment methods are needed. One potential common underlying feature of both mTBI and PTSD is exaggerated inflammation, both peripherally and in the central nervous system, which is thought to play an important role in the vulnerability to, aggravation of, and perpetuation of adverse consequences of these often co-occurring conditions. Therefore, a novel intervention strategy would be the use of immunoregulatory/anti- inflammatory probiotics to reduce inflammation. In this study, we will investigate the effects of an immunoregulatory probiotic on both biological signatures of systemic inflammatory processes and proximal signatures of probiotic administration. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri), a commensal organism that colonizes the human gut mucosa, suppresses mucosal inflammation via inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and is the probiotic of interest. Specific aims of the study are to determine the: 1) effects of L.  reuteri on biological signatures of gut microbiota, gut permeability, systemic inflammation processes, and stress responses; 2) feasibility of L. reuteri supplementation; 3) acceptability of L. reuteri supplementation; and 4) tolerability and safety of L. reuteri supplementation. Project aims will be assessed using a longitudinal, double blind, randomized placebo-controlled design. Participants will be Veterans with PPC symptoms, PTSD, and evidence of elevated systemic inflammation (based on high baseline plasma C-reactive protein [CRP] concentrations). After initial evaluation procedures, 20 participants will be randomized to probiotic supplementation and 20 will be randomized to placebo supplementation. The proposed line of research addresses the Office of Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) Service's goal of identifying means of intervening to increase function among those with mTBI and co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Long-term, this study may lead to a paradigm shift in the manner by which we target clinical symptoms associated with PPC and PTSD symptoms, by beginning the process of supporting a multitargeted, neuroprotective approach."

We have so far identified dozens of DNA methylation markers unique to ? cells and additional cell types, and developed a method to detect these markers in plasma, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of death of ? cells and other cell types. Herein we propose to optimize and validate this sensitive qualitative assay, to allow the simultaneous detection of multiple methylation markers for sensitive identification of cell death in multiple tissues in T1D. Our goal is to determine altered turnover of ? cells, pancreatic exocrine cells and T cells, prior to and during the development of T1D. We hope ultimately to perform a methylome- wide analysis of T1D plasma. Such data will facilitate a better understanding of cell death in T1D, and enable the development of markers to assess interventional strategies. We will apply these techniques using both archived material and freshly isolated blood from patients and healthy volunteers. The project is a collaboration between Desmond Schatz (University of Florida), Yuval Dor (Hebrew University) and Carla Greenbaum (Benaroya Research Institute).

All are academic sites highly experienced in conducting clinical studies in severe asthma, and all have made important contributions to current knowledge about disease mechanisms in asthma. Together, we propose to quickly recruit 100 patients with severe and exacerbation prone asthma for enrollment in PrecISE, and we will implement each network-wide protocol approved by the Steering Committee. In Aim 2 we propose that PrecISE should adopt the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) approach to conduct adaptive trials in subgroups of asthmatics defined by the presence or absence of systemic IL6 inflammation or systemic eosinophilia. We specifically propose three clinical trials, each in approximately one third of the 800 person PrecISE cohort. Trial #1 will sequentially test the efficacy of Tocilizumab and Anakinra in IL6-high asthma. Trial #2 will sequentially test the efficacy of Mepolizumab and Dupilumab in reversing airflow obstruction in patients with ?type 2-high? asthma. Trial #3 will sequentially test the efficacy of Doxycycline and steroid withdrawal on asthma control in patients with ?type 2- low? asthma.

"9370392","PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with hyperuricemia (HU) and gout; however, the causal  relationship is unclear. Of >30 urate genes identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), ten are  also associated with CKD. Genetic variation in urate transporters (e.g., SLC2A9, encoding the GLUT9  transporter) has been implicated in HU and gout; however, exact causal genes and their mechanisms are  unclear. The regulatory effects on GLUT9 and other urate transporters and signaling networks associated with  HU and CKD are highly relevant to understanding the functional genomics of HU and its causality with CKD.  Furthermore, APOL1 protein, linked to the genetic risk of CKD in African Americans, is co-expressed with  GLUT9, and our data suggest an association of APOL1 genotype on serum urate (sUA).Our goal is to fill these  key knowledge gaps by unraveling the molecular relationship between HU and CKD. To achieve this, we  propose key translational genetic and functional studies, using cutting-edge translational physiology  and genetics. In Aim 1 we will screen and characterize regulatory proteins (including APOL1) implicated in both  HU and CKD to identify functional interactions with urate transport. To accomplish this we will first examine the  effects on urate transport in co-expression with GLUT9 and other urate transporters in Xenopus oocytes. This  approach has already revealed novel physiology for the digenic TMEM171/174 locus, with inhibition of  basolateral GLUT9 by TMEM171 and of apical URAT1 transport by TMEM174. Multiple resequencing resources  will be screened for uncommon penetrant coding variants in these regulatory genes, segregating with extremes  in sUA; functional effects of these variants will then be characterized. In Aim 2 we propose state-of-the-art  genetic approaches using very large, publicly available data sets to discover the causality and shared genetic  etiology of HU and CKD. To determine the relative importance of shared genetic and/or environmental  contributions to HU and CKD, we will quantify directly the genome-wide marker-based genetic and environmental  correlation between sUA and eGFR/CKD using multivariate Bayesian whole genome regression (WGR). To  ascertain specific genes and pathways jointly contributing to HU and eGFR/CKD we will estimate the genetic  correlation in genomic regions using WGR. We will investigate a causal role of urate-raising genetic variants in  reduced renal function; this will be formally tested by Mendelian randomization. Finally, there is a major unmet  need for a genetically tractable model of human urate homeostasis. Our group has shown that human stem-cell-  derived kidney cells self-organize into human kidney organoids that functionally recapitulate tissue-specific  epithelial physiology. In Aim 3 we will utilize this system to study CKD- and HU-associated genes, first analyzing  the role of a regulatory SNP in the TMEM171/174 locus and the individual roles of TMEM171 and TMEM174 in  renal tubular urate physiology. Completion of the project will yield novel tools for translational urate research and  novel insight into shared pathways in CKD and HU, suitable for therapeutic targeting."
"9540281","Research Abstract Depression is the single largest health care burden in the world; no other illness accounts for even half its burden. Recently, the World Bank, WHO, and NIMH highlighted the crippling economic costs of unaddressed depression and the need to scale up depression care globally. In Vietnam, we have found collaborative care to be effective and have conducted clustered randomized control trial that has shown large effect sizes for a Multicomponent Collaborative Care Model for Depression (MCCD), in which depression care was task-shifted to primary care providers in local community health clinics and supported by mobile psychiatrists. While the benefits of collaborative care for depression are well-established, the most appropriate and effective implementation strategies for scaling up this model have not been identified. To address this knowledge gap, our R01 proposal will build on our team's previous work on the MCCD and leverage current policy initiatives related to depression care in Vietnam to identify implementation models most likely to lead to successful implementation and sustainment of effective services in low resource settings. We will partner with local and national community and government organizations to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing effectiveness of three implementation models: (a) usual implementation (UI), which typically includes one workshop and toolkit; (b) enhanced supervision (ES; includes model UI); and (c) community-engaged learning collaborative (CELC; includes ES). According to the RE-AIM Implementation Evaluation framework, to have a population-level impact, an EBI must be adopted by providers, reach a large proportion of the targeted patient population, be implemented with fidelity, effectively improve outcomes, and be maintained after research funds are withdrawn, thus we will assess implementation outcomes at the organizational, provider, and patient levels based on this framework. Additionally, we will assess organizational and provider factors associated with successful implementation and measure incremental cost-effectiveness of each implementation strategy. Comparing implementation models on RE-AIM implementation outcomes and cost-effectiveness can guide policy decisions on best strategies to support scale-up of collaborative care models for depression and other EBIs. This comprehensive and rigorous implementation effectiveness study will contribute to our understanding of the added value of using a CELC strategy over and above the best practice in training (ES), which has not been done even in high-income countries. This timely evaluation of an depression care task- shifting will provide much needed knowledge about what implementation strategies and factors promote adoption, delivery, and sustainment of high-quality depression care in low-resource settings where limited mental health human resources are available, addressing global priority knowledge gaps in implementation science and mental health research."
"9492123","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Immunotherapy has emerged as an important treatment modality for cancer. In contrast to most other cancer treatments, immunotherapy can induce durable clinical response in metastatic disease. Antibodies targeting PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 have shown significant clinical activity in multiple diseases. Importantly, dramatic clinical responses have been seen in patients with the metastatic bladder, a disease in which no new drugs have been approved for over 20 years. The mechanism by which these immunotherapies work in cancer patients is unknown, nor are there robust biomarkers that predict of response to these treatments.  We will perform a clinical study administering anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with localized bladder cancer prior to these patients undergoing planned surgery for their cancer. We propose to study the effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment not just in the blood but within the actual tumor. We will determine whether this immunotherapy increases the number of T cells into the tumor by examining tissues from biopsies obtained before treatment and from the bladder tumor resected following treatment. We will use next generation sequencing to track individual T cell clones in the blood and tumors to also determine whether T cells present in the tumor are being recruited to the tumor site or were already at the tumor. We will study how this treatment activates a systemic immune response.  Understanding how these treatments work within patients, including at the level of the tumor tissue, will provide avenues t improve the efficacy of this approach and/or develop biomarkers to identify those patients that can benefit from treatment. Moreover, if significant tumor regression is seen, this treatment approach could transform our approach to localized bladder cancer. Finally, the clinical and laboratory findings derived from this trial may also help transform in how metastatic bladder cancer could be treated and contribute significantly to the design of future clinical trials with P-L1 and/or PD-1 targeted drugs."
"9370636","ABSTRACT  Prosthetic joint infection (PJI), the vast majority of which is caused by Staphylococcal species, is the bane of  elective total joint replacement surgery. The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the unique problems of  PJI, which render these infections incurable, remain largely unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we  performed extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies that uncovered novel, previously  unreported mechanisms of S. aureus colonization of canaliculi and submicron cracks in cortical bone. Our  novel observations suggest, counter to the well-accepted dogma, that S. aureus must have motility  mechanisms that allow it to identify canaliculi and submicron cracks by geometric and rigidity cues from the 3D  extracellular matrix of bone, and subsequently deform from spherical cocci into rod shaped bacteria that propel  its mitotic progeny through asymmetric septal planes through the submicron canaliculi. This mechanism  shelters the S. aureus in these submicron cracks and canaliculi such that leukocytes become incapable of  reaching them. This also likely limits the effectiveness of antimicrobials and renders the infection incurable.  Thus, our global hypothesis is that S. aureus utilizes haptotaxis and durotaxis (directional mobility guided by  geometric and rigidity cues from the 3D extracellular matrix, respectively), to incurably colonize canaliculi and  submicron channels in cortical bone. In this application, we take innovative genetic and small molecule  screening approaches to design new generations of antimicrobials that inhibit haptotaxis- and durotaxis-  mediated colonization of cortical bone. In Aim 1, we use innovative nanoporous silicon membrane transwell  chambers to define kinetics of occupancy and migration of S. aureus through submicron channels ex vivo, to  simulate in vivo haptotaxis and durotaxis through canaliculi. We also propose to complete a case-control  clinical correlate study documenting S. aureus colonization of microcracks and osteocytic-canalicular networks  of infected human cortical bone. In Aim 2, we take a focused candidate gene analysis and non-biased de novo  genetic screens, with complementary empiric TnSeq mutant library screen approach to identify S. aureus  genes involved in canalicular invasion and migration. In Aim 3, we propose to develop 3D-printed spacers  infused with novel antibiotics, that target essential enzymes for RNA and protein synthesis in biofilm-  associated bacteria or essential proteins involved in haptotaxis and durotaxis, to demonstrate the efficacy of  single-stage revision of septic femoral plates in an established OM murine model. The multidisciplinary  approach, encompassing tissue engineering and 3D printing, microbial genomics, and high throughput  screening of small molecule antimicrobials, will provide critical information needed to solve the significant  clinical problems of bone infection by formally understanding this process, identifying novel drug targets, and  exploring the potential of localized delivery using 3D-printed antibiotic-impregnated spacers for single-stage  revision surgery."
"9377992","Project Summary/Abstract Despite a decade of work on super-resolution imaging, a large amount of sub-cellular phenomena remains in- visible due to the poor temporal resolution of current techniques. As a result, there is an urgent need for a ?exible, accessible, and quantitative super-resolution imaging system with improved temporal and spatial reso- lution. For example, DNA has characteristic lengths between 5 nm and 150 nm that exhibit signi?cant dynamic changes over time scales as small as 1 ms, which are length and time scales that are not within the capabilities of current super-resolution methodologies. Our long-term goal is to develop and apply measurement tools to further our understanding of mechanisms and dysfunction of sub-cellular phenomena. The overall objective of this application and the next step in attaining this long-term goal is to drastically improve the temporal resolu- tion of super-resolution through both single-acquisition super-resolution microscopy as well as 3D localization at an order of magnitude greater ?uorophore density. The rationale underlying this research is that current super- resolution instruments are inadequate for visualizing many small-scale and fast sub-cellular processes. Reaching these smaller lengths and faster time scales requires a new approach toward visualizing these phenomena if we are to understand them with suf?cient ?delity to treat or diagnose diseases. To ensure that we achieve the ob- jective of this application we have developed the following Speci?c Aims: 1) Development of Single-Acquisition Super-Resolution Microscopy, which will result in a 40% improvement in diffraction limited resolution in every im- age, and 2) Development of 3D Dense-Emitter Image Analysis Algorithm, which will result in the ability to either locate in 3D emitters as close together as 60 nm with 10 nm isotropic resolution from a single image or recon- struct the 3D sub-diffraction density of closer emitters. Together these new and improved capabilities will enable improvements to the temporal resolution with which super-resolution data is acquired. The approach is innovative in our opinion, because it utilizes a novel imaging system (Bessel Beam Microscopy) that trades low-frequency information for spatial resolution, which differs from current super-resolution systems that trade temporal reso- lution for spatial resolution. The proposed research is signi?cant because it expands super-resolution imaging capability in an area where there is a particularly urgent need. Providing high-speed sub-diffraction limit 3D re- construction capabilities will allow real-time monitoring of, for example, chromatin packing level and stiffness in response to transcription. Additionally, stochastic super-resolution techniques such as STORM/PALM will bene?t from the accurate localization at dense labeling, improving their temporal resolution."
"9359223","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Neuroblastoma (NB) remains a leading cause of childhood cancer deaths, and the children who do survive are  left with long-term side effects, many of which can be life threatening. In this era of more precise therapies,  considerable efforts are being made to identify optimal targets. While the paradigm of molecularly targeted  therapies holds great promise, genomic studies have revealed that NBs are characterized by extensive  intratumor genetic heterogeneity, with subclonal oncogenic drivers often selected for during standard  chemoradiotherapy. Our group discovered gain-of-function mutations in the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase as  the etiology for familial NB, and at the same time co-discovered with several other groups identical mutations  as the most frequent somatic single nucleotide variants leading to a potent oncogenic driver in up to 15% of  newly diagnosed high-risk cases. Our more recent work has shown that activating mutations in the ALK-RAS-  MAPK pathway are highly enriched in the relapse NB genome, providing the impetus for deep and  comprehensive characterization of the subclonal landscape of genes within these pathways across the  continuum of therapy. This serves at the motivation for this Project and provides the opportunity to both adapt  therapeutic approaches as tumors evolve, and also target subclonal mutations earlier to prevent the acquisition  of chemotherapy resistant dominant clones. The central hypothesis to be explored here is that high-risk NBs  are characterized by extensive intratumoral and stroma-derived heterogeneity and harbor pre-existing and  acquired subclonal populations that confer therapy resistance that can exploited with rationally selected  targeted agents. We will test our central hypothesis in three Specific Aims: 1) Define the frequency and clinical  significance of subclonal driver mutations; 2) Identify therapeutic vulnerabilities imparted by inhibition of  oncogenic ALK and/or RAS-MAPK signaling; 3) Target tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic oncogenic  vulnerabilities for development of rational novel therapeutics. The first Aim will employ a custom ultra-deep  sequencing platform to define the clonal and subclonal architecture and mutational landscape in diagnostic and  relapse NBs, including PDX models. Aim 2 is devoted to defining therapeutically exploitable oncogenic  vulnerabilities with a focus on demonstrating that inhibition of FAK leads to robust anti-tumor activity in ALK-  and RAS-driven NBs treated with inhibitors of these pathways. The final Aim will garner the preclinical  justification required to move combination therapies to the clinic, building on our extensive preliminary data of  synergistic drug interactions in our oncogene-driven models. We consider this project significant because it will  result in new mechanism-based biomarker-defined therapeutic strategies that ultimately should significantly  improve high-risk NB patient outcomes. This will address the major unmet need that despite unprecedented  discoveries in defining the basic mechanisms of NB tumorigenesis, this knowledge has not yet translated into  significantly improved outcomes for patients with high-risk disease."

"9566471","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel anti-infective approach is to exploit stresses already imposed on invading organisms in vivo. Iron (Fe) metabolism is a key vulnerability of infecting bacteria because organisms require Fe for growth. We have shown that a strategy that uses the metal gallium (Ga) to disrupt bacterial Fe, metabolism holds promise as an antimicrobial approach. Due to its chemical similarity to Fe, Ga can substitute for Fe in many biologic systems and inhibit Fe-dependent processes. Our data shows that Ga kills the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (including antibiotic resistant strains), is active against biofilms, and treats 3 different models of P. aeruginosa infections. Ga has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. These data, the fact that gallium nitrate (trade name, GaniteTM) is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for intravenous (IV) administration, and the dearth of new antibiotics in development make Ga a promising new therapeutic for P. aeruginosa infections. We have shown in our initial phase 1b study in patients with cystic fibrosis chronically infected with P. aeruginosa that IV Ga is safe, well tolerated, ha a good pharmacokinetic profile and is associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in lung function 14 days and 28 days after the start of a 5 day infusion of IV Ga. Here we propose a proof of concept phase 2 clinical trial to confirm our prior findings of efficacy and provide further data regarding the safety and pharmacokinetics of IV Ga in CF subjects infected with P. aeruginosa. We also propose two ancillary projects to further delineate the mechanism of action of this new agent. Chronic P. aeruginosa airway infections are the major cause of death in these patients and few treatments exist. This drug could represent a novel approach to treating this infection and have implications for other challenging infections."
"9342740","PROJECT SUMMARY  We and others recently identified mutations in histone 3 variants in a significant fraction of children and young  adults with a deadly brain tumor and maiming bone cancers. This is a very new uncharted area in cancer that  will benefit from improved understanding of disease biology and the design of accurate experimental models to  recapitulate these epigenetic cancers as we aim to do in this project. Strikingly data we further acquired with  other funding suggest these ?oncohistones? as we labeled them possibly arise during specific windows of  normal organ development. Indeed, each mutation in a given H3 isoform has age, organ and anatomic location  within an organ, specificities. There is added complexity in HGA as we showed requirement of distinct added  genetic alterations that are also age, brain location and H3 variant specific. Oncohistones are a new major  paradigm shift in the field of cancer, and limited knowledge exists on how they act in tumor formation. Our  project, integrated with other projects in this Program, aims to overcome this major knowledge gap and  obstacle to effective therapy. We aim to ?decode? how these mutations mechanistically affect the epigenomic  landscape in tumors in the context of Development (Aims 1 and 2). We will provide critically needed relevant  experimental models of histone mutations (Aim 2) and thrive to faithfully recapitulate human disease in HGA  (Aims 2 and 3). Our group (Jabado/Majewski) was one of two to first identify a histone mutation in human  disease. We have first-hand knowledge on HGA and other pediatric cancers and unparalleled access to tumor  samples, animal models and clinical information. Allis identified H3.3 and the Allis and Muir labs are one of  the best positioned to biochemically and mechanistically help study these mutations. There is natural synergy,  cross-interactions and sharing of resources and materials between the three projects in this Program. We will  receive essential support to integrate and analyse the vast datasets we are generating in primary tumors and  model systems while benefiting from the resources and novel technical approaches and integration of complex  datasets used by the Genomics/Epigenomics Sequencing core (Majewski and the epigenomic expert co-  investigator Pastinen). The Quantitative proteomics core (Garcia), one of the rare groups able to study  combination of mutations in histones on the protein level will allow precise measurement of histone mutants in  patients and mouse samples and our experimental models. The natural interactions and synergies within this  program and the level of expertise within it ensure that we will make significant breakthroughs in these cancers  that can translate into improved care for patients."
"9516699","Project Summary  No effective treatments are available for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a group of rare inherited blistering disorders that can be devastating and in some cases lethal. The technological breakthrough that allows adult skin cells to be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) now offers the possibility of developing a permanent corrective therapy for EB. The therapeutic approach relies on the generation of patient-specific iPSCs, which then undergo genetic correction and differentiation into skin cells suitable for transplantation. The generation of iPSCs from the same patient in need of treatment would not only potentially avoid the complication of immune rejection, but also provide an unlimited and scalable source of patient- specific cells suitable for transplantation. For the initial studies funded by the parent R01, we focused on developing an iPSC-based therapy for a cohort of patients suffering from the Dowling-Meara subtype of EB simplex (EBS-DM), who share the same R125C ?hot spot mutation? in the keratin 14 (Krt14) protein that is responsible for 70% of the EBS-DM cases. This EBS-DM study has allowed us to address all of the major obstacles and pre-requisites required for the development of a clinically relevant iPSC-based therapy for EBS. Specifically, we have developed a novel, efficient method for the generation of clinically relevant integration- free iPSCs. We have also used non-integrating selection marker-free gene editing technology to successfully correct the genetic defect in iPSCs generated from an EBS patient. In addition, our high-efficiency of reprogramming has recently allowed us to combine gene editing and reprogramming of EBS fibroblasts into a one-step procedure. This revision application is proposing to expand the one-step combined gene editing and reprogramming approach to a more severe form of EB, recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB) and to advance our findings toward a clinical trial. Given that the collaborative efforts among several groups will be required to ensure the successful translation of complex iPSC-based therapies into the clinic, we have recently entered into a consortium with Stanford and Columbia Universities to facilitate the development of an optimal manufacturing protocol for genetically corrected iPSC-derived cell products for RDEB treatment. Therefore, Aim 1 of this proposal is to improve the safety and reduce the manufacturing complexity of an iPSC-based therapy for RDEB by combining reprogramming and gene editing into a one-step procedure; Aims 2 and 3 are to manufacture cGMP-compliant reagents for reprogramming and gene editing respectively to assist the Consortium in generating Investigational New Drug (IND) - enabling data for the FDA. The EB iPS Cell Consortium?s success in obtaining approval for a clinical trial for RDEB would expand the therapeutic potential of iPSCs for the treatment of a variety of monogenic diseases affecting other internal organs, where the difficulty in monitoring adverse effects of an iPSC-based therapy would make them unlikely first targets."
"9430527","Project abstract Analysis of tumor-stroma signaling that mediates HER2-therapy resistance in breast cancer Drug resistance remains a great concern in HER2+ breast cancer, and a significant portion of patients (40-75%) will ultimately not respond to therapy. A better understanding of the causes of HER2-therapy resistance is therefore needed, in order to improve patient outcomes. To date, investigations on mechanisms contributing to HER2-therapy resistance have focused on tumor cell intrinsic factors that promote cell growth and survival. The role of extrinsic signals stemming from the tumor microenvironment (i.e. stroma), however, remains unclear.  The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of tumor-stroma interactions in HER2-therapy resistance and develop new strategies to re-sensitize tumor cells to therapy by (1) evaluating whether sensitivity to lapatinib correlates with stroma-rich niches in a panel of HER2+ breast cancer models ex vivo and in vivo (Aim 1), (2) examining tumor cell apoptotic priming as a tumor cell survival mechanism in HER2+ breast cancer patient-derived xenografts and patient samples from the clinical trial TRIO-US-B07 (Aim 2), (3) investigating additional tumor cell survival mechanisms by an unbiased mass-spectrometry analysis and developing and optimizing novel combination-therapies using computational modeling and in vivo studies with patient-derived xenograft models (Aim 3). The results from the proposed studies will lead to the identification of microenvironmental niches and associated tumor cell signaling pathways that could serve as biomarkers for patient stratification and provide important information for the design of rational combination therapies that will re-sensitize tumors to treatment.  This proposal draws on my bioengineering background and postdoctoral training in cancer biology, however in order to ensure completion of the goals and successful transition to independence, I have also devised a detailed training plan, under the guidance of my mentor Dr. Brugge and my advisory team Dr. Letai, Dr. Michor and Dr. Sorger. During the mentored phase I plan to acquire new skills in (1) systems analysis and modeling of high-dimensional proteomic datasets to elucidate tumor-stroma signaling, (2) development of predictive mathematical models for designing effective drug combinations, (3) multiplexed immunofluorescence to profile in situ molecular markers in tumor and stroma cells and (4) analysis of predictive biomarkers in samples from clinical trials. The environment at Harvard Medical School presents an excellent opportunity for training in quantitative cancer biology and maximizing the translational potential of my research. I will also mentor students and further develop my grantsmanship and lab management skills. The proposed research plan combined with the career development training will significantly aid me to become an independent investigator in the field of tumor microenvironment bioengineering."
"9458544","Type 1 (T1D) diabetes results from the immune mediated loss of ? cell mass and function. With a reduced proliferation, and an increase immune mediated ? cell apoptosis, insulin producing cells become insufficient to adequately regulate body glycemia. The historical dogma for which soon after T1D diagnosis ? cell were fully and permanently lost has been challenged by recent studies revealing that even patients with long-standing diabetes residual ? cells are retained as demonstrated by the presence of insulin positive islets in the pancreas and by increase production of endogenous insulin after mixed-meal tolerance test. T1 diabetes can thus been seen as a chronic disease in which the balance exist between ? cells autoimmune destruction, regeneration, and resistance to apoptosis. Clinically this balance is obviously tilted toward the progressive loss of ? cell mass, however, it might be theoretically possible to normalize ? cell homeostasis by reducing loss, recovering function, and enhancing regeneration of remnant ? cells.  Recent advancements in the understanding ? cell biology and in the field of RNA therapeutics offer an unprecedented opportunity for a targeted manipulation selectively in ? cells of those genes that control cell proliferation, apoptosis and resistance to autoimmunity.  We propose that RNA aptamers specific for islet cells might be the tool for the specific delivery of therapeutic RNA able to positively and negatively modulate gene expression in endogenous and transplanted ? cells.  RNA aptamers are small, RNAse resistant, non-immunogenic oligonucleotide that can penetrate deeply into the tissue and recognize their target in virtue of their three dimensional structure with high affinity and specificity. These synthetic antibodies are chemically synthetized, can be easily conjugated with small interference or small activating RNAs (siRNA or saRNA) and can be selected to penetrate into the cytoplasm upon target binding.  We have recently identified by an unsupervised selection method, bioinformatics analysis and empirical validation, two monoclonal RNA aptamers able to recognized preferentially human ? cells in vivo.  With the long term goal to beneficially modulate ? cell homeostasis and defense from auto-immunity in vivo, we decided to conjugate these aptamer with small RNA able to upregulate PDL1 and Xiap (to allow ? cell to fight back the immunologic attack and inhibit apoptosis respectively) and to down-regulate p57kip2 (to promote ? cell proliferation). Preliminary in vitro data using non-dissociated human islets demonstrated that the resulting therapeutic-RNA/islet-specific aptamer chimera effectively modulate the expression of the target genes. With this proposal we will test the hypothesis that aptamer-chimeras can be mediated in vivo gene modulation in human islet cells. This should allow to modify ? cell function and homeostasis by preventing their loss, by increasing their proliferation, and by providing protection from autoimmunity. This innovative approach may allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies for T1D based on the in vivo targeted modulation of ? cell genes."
"9385767","H3ABioNet Project Summary H3ABioNet, a pan African bioinformatics network for H3Africa, had the enormous task of building bioinformatics capacity for genomics research against a backdrop of high disease burden, limited resources, poor internet and a large gap in bioinformatics skills in Africa. Despite these challenges, the network achieved a number of successes by building computing infrastructure and associated skills, developing and facilitating access to analysis tools, and implementing a comprehensive training programme. In the next phase, H3ABioNet will extend these activities more broadly to develop a robust and innovative informatics network that addresses the complex needs of genomics researchers from clinical and biological data collection to genomic data generation and analysis and ultimately to impactful translation health research. The network will be the H3Africa data coordinating centre, hosting the data prior to submission to public repositories and providing access to data in line with the needs and consent of PIs and participants. It will ensure that data is quality controlled, standardized and interoperable. In order to facilitate adequate exploitation of genomic data, H3ABioNet will improve the user experience with genomics tools, adapting them, where necessary, for African data. The network will also go beyond this by seeking innovative data integration and translational solutions to enable comprehensive systems level analysis of diseases to ensure African scientists not only remain internationally competitive, but lead the way in translational research with tangible benefits for patients. The informatics infrastructure will be implemented through eight work packages: 1) Health Informatics; 2) Data and standards; 3) Databases and resources; 4) Pipelines and Computing; 5) Tool Development; 6) Integration; 7) Training; and 8) Sustainability, Outreach and Development. A ninth, cross-cutting activity, will be H3Africa project and Coordinating Center support in data analysis and the use of the infrastructure developed. H3ABioNet will reach out to all members of the H3Africa consortium and beyond to ensure maximum utilization of our resources and to transfer skills across the continent. It will develop the next generation of African scientists who have multidisciplinary skills and the capacity to successfully attract research funding. Links with national and international organisations and networks will ensure that these scientists remain on the cutting edge of genomics and are well placed for future realisation of precision medicine."
"9177659","Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The deleterious effects of alcohol abuse on the liver leads to pathologically distinct entities: steatosis, steatohepatitis (ASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. NLRP3 inflammasome is a multi-protein cytoplasmic complex that serves as pattern recognition receptor and has emerged as key mediator of inflammation, and cell death. The NLRP3 inflammasome senses damage- associated molecular patterns and induces secretion of IL-1? and IL-18 that may be destructive to tissues. We, and others, have recently shown that hepatic caspase 1 activation occurs during the development of ASH and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and this activation appears to be mediated through the NLRP3 inflammasome. These studies demonstrated that caspase 1 plays an important role in inflammation and fibrosis during ASH and NASH development while IL-1 receptor antagonist ameliorates ASH in mice. A role for NLRP3 inflammasome gain-of-function mutations was initially described in a group of rare autoinflammatory monogenic conditions. Subsequently, multiple gene polymorphisms have been described and some have been implicated in common chronic inflammatory conditions including Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, two common polymorphisms affecting 15-20% of general population have been shown to result in gain-of-function phenotype associated with moderately increased IL-1? levels. Based on these preliminary data we propose the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that 1) NLRP3 is required for the progression of ethanol-induced fatty liver to ASH and fibrosis in mice; 2) Genetic variation in NLRP3-inflammasome expression predicts progression and/or severity of ALD and response to IL-1-based therapy in ASH. To investigate this hypothesis our proposal has following SPECIFIC AIMS. First: Determine the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation on ALD progression from fatty liver to steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Second: Determine the role of genetic variations of NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in gain-of-function phenotypes in susceptibility to ALD and response to IL-1-based therapy in patients with ALD. To address these central issues, we have put together a Multi-PI investigative team including a Pioneered Scientist in Inflammasome Biology, and Experts in Cell Death, Fibrosis and Alcoholic Liver Disease Pathology. The results of these studies will uncover crucial aspects of NLRP3 inflammasome biology and its contribution to liver pathology in ALD that may lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with this disease."
"9450436","PROJECT SUMMARY The role of selenium (Se) in metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), is controversial, with epidemiological studies pointing towards either a protective or a deleterious role in disease incidence. Se is a micronutrient essential to life, and available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement in the USA. In our bodies, Se is processed into selenocysteine (Sec), an amino acid present at the core of selenoproteins. Selenoproteins mostly function in countering oxidative stress. In T2D, oxidative stress is elevated, which affects glucose utilization and homeostasis. Sec is decomposed into alanine and selenide by the enzyme Sec lyase (Scly), with selenide being the selenium form reutilized in selenoprotein translation, recycling Se. Characterization of a Scly KO mouse in our laboratory revealed this model to develop obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance, suggesting Scly participates in mechanisms regulating glucose homeostasis. Preliminary studies identified pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx) as an interactor of Scly. Following up on this surprising finding revealed increased amounts of pyruvate and two metabolites of glycine metabolism, glycine, and dimethylglycine, in livers of Scly KO mouse. Pcx catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate, the first committed step of gluconeogenesis, a mechanism by which glucose-starving hepatocytes can produce and utilize glucose. Our long-term objective is to understand the role of Se metabolism in disorders involving glucose metabolism, specifically T2D, a health disparity that is prevalent among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The overall goal of this research proposal is thus to investigate the role of Scly in glucose homeostasis. Our central hypothesis is that Scly regulates glucose homeostasis through regulation of glycine metabolism and pyruvate levels via interaction with Pcx to fuel energy metabolism. Aim 1 includes in vitro and in vivo confirmation of the interaction between Scly and Pcx, characterization of the subcellular location where interaction occurs, and whether Se levels regulate this interaction. In Aim 2, we will investigate if the interaction of Scly and Pcx is dependent on glucose levels, if each binding partner is required for the effects on glucose utilization, and whether this regulatory mechanism is also physiologically relevant in an additional insulin target tissue, the adipocyte. Moreover, we will identify transcripts that are differentially expressed in liver and white adipose tissue in Scly KO and WT mice. These results will further our understanding of the crosstalk between the antioxidant micronutrient Se and energy metabolism, and incorporate a neglected micronutrient into hepatic and adipocyte physiology. Since Se is an over-the-counter dietary supplement that 19% of Americans consume, this innovative perspective of the research will provide a basis for improvements in Se nutritional guidelines and ultimately benefit mechanistic comprehension of T2D."
"9349606","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor with a dismal survival rate that averages 15 months. Few therapeutic options are available, and virtually all patients experience disease progression within less than a year of initial treatment, primarily resulting from glioma cell invasion. Therapies attempting to target invasion have been ineffective because of the complex heterogeneous nature of GBM and migratory signaling; however, these pathways converge on the nonmuscle myosin II (NMMII) molecular motor proteins, making these molecular motors essential and non-redundant. The lab of my sponsor, Dr. Steven Rosenfeld, has established that NMMII motors are fundamental to glioma migration because of their ability to generate force on the actin cytoskeleton. The NMMII heavy chain has three different isoforms (IIA, IIB, and IIC), and each likely has different roles in glioma invasion based on its distinct biomechanical properties. However, the exact physiologic role of each isoform has never been defined at the mechanistic level but could prove critical to understanding glioma cell invasion. This proposal focuses on the role of NMMIIA, as this isoform is upregulated in GBM and high expression predicts worse prognosis. Interestingly a specific regulator of NMMIIA dynamics, S100A4, mirrors the expression and survival correlation of NMMIIA. I hypothesize that both NMMIIA and S100A4 are integral in the dispersion of glioma cells through the brain and targeting NMMIIA-mediated migration will increase efficacy of current local therapies or in combination with other targeted therapies. Indeed, preliminary data indicates that cre-mediated deletion of NMMIIA in our mouse model of GBM results in non-invasive tumors. Despite appearing encapsulated, the tumors are larger and more lethal, which is consistent with recent reports that NMMIIA is a tumor suppressor. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to investigate the function of NMMIIA both as a motility enhancer and as a tumor suppressor, using novel in vitro 2D and 3D migration assays, in situ brain tissue migration imaging, as well as comprehensive state-of-the-art proliferation, cytokinesis, and apoptosis assays. Aim 2 focuses on S100A4, which may only be needed for NMMIIA motility functions that specifically require rapid filament disassembly/assembly dynamics. To investigate this hypothesis, S100A4 will be deleted from cre retrovirus-induced GBM tumors in our mouse model, and in vivo tumor survival and invasion will be assessed. In vitro studies will complement Aim 1 to determine the effect of S100A4 deletion on migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. The training for this fellowship will include intensive hands-on instruction in migration imaging, image analysis, and bioinformatics education for analyzing RNAseq data from NMMIIA-deleted tumors. Translating these findings into effective GBM therapies is our ultimate goal. However understanding the role of NMMIIA in cell biology is paramount to developing treatments and has the potential impact beyond GBM."
"9386951","The primary goal of this project is to identify major genetic factors that are responsible for POAG in persons of African ancestry. Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma in the world, and is the cause of glaucoma in over 90% of those living with glaucoma in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). POAG has a complex genetic etiology, and moreover manifests as a health disparity that disproportionately affects individuals of African descent. In major population-based studies in Ghana, more than 6% of those over the age of 40 were affected with POAG, and more than 40% of patients diagnosed with POAG are blind in one or both eyes. This places a huge financial and societal burden on Africans. Populations of the African diaspora are also disproportionately affected. In African Americans, the prevalence of POAG is 4-5% over the age of 40, which is over four fold higher than in age-matched Caucasians. The risk of blindness from POAG is 10 times greater for African Americans than for Caucasians, making it the most common cause of permanent blindness in African Americans. We will collect DNA from approximately 6,000 individuals with POAG and 6,000 matched controls from multiple countries in Africa. These samples will be genotyped on the Illumina H3Africa custom chip. Data will be imputed and GWAS will be performed. We will also use this data to assist in the linkage analysis of multiplex families with early-onset glaucoma, and to conduct QTL analyses to identify any genomic loci that are associated with treatment outcome in the Sub Saharan Africa Glaucoma Laser Trial.

"9396382","Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major health concern, particularly for women Veterans. Women who experience IPV present frequently in health settings, providing opportunity for detection and intervention. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is implementing IPV screening programs in primary care. This is a critical first step to ensuring women Veterans receive quality care that leads to improved health. However, the initial uptake of IPV screening is low and there is variation in the clinical practices and implementation characteristics of IPV screening programs across VHA. As the implementation of IPV screening programs is still in its infancy, there is a time-sensitive opportunity to learn from VA Medical Centers that have implemented IPV screening programs to inform the scale-up and spread of best practices. Objectives This proposal will identify the `what,' `how' and `why' of successful implementation of IPV screening programs in VHA. The Specific Aims are to: 1) characterize best practices of IPV screening programs in VHA through key stakeholder interviews with clinicians and administrators (n>30) at five high and five low adopting facilities; 2) understand multi-level barriers to and facilitators of IPV screening program implementation through the interviews with key stakeholders in the high and low adopting facilities; and, 3) tailor context-sensitive implementation strategies through input from a Stakeholder Advisory Board to inform a future research proposal to enhance implementation effectiveness of IPV screening programs in VHA. Methods For Aims 1 and 2, we will collect qualitative data through key stakeholder interviews with clinicians and administrators (n>30) at VA Medical Centers that have implemented IPV screening within women's health clinics. High and low adopting sites have been identified by Care Management and Social Work Services. We will purposively select five high and five low adopting sites for participation. At each site, we will interview between 2-4 key administrators and clinicians (e.g., Women's Health Medical Director). Interviews will assess the IPV screening and response practices used in the clinics and identify implementation characteristics. Qualitative findings will inform the tailoring of implementation strategies through input from a Stakeholder Advisory Board (Aim 3). Anticipated Impact on Veteran's Healthcare VHA's Blueprint for Excellence identifies ?advancing innovations in women Veterans' health care? as a key transformational strategy. This program of research will address this goal for IPV care. The research will advance national efforts by establishing best clinical practices for IPV screening programs and strategies useful for enhancing implementation of IPV screening programs, thereby ultimately improving services for and health of women Veterans."
"9223120","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learning reorganizes brain activity to encode long-lasting memories of emotional events. These memories enhance survival by guiding adaptive behaviors like pursuit of food and avoidance of threats. However, in 6.8% of Americans, and as high as 14-16% of U.S. military service members, the experience of trauma leads to severe and recurrent anxiety and fear, exacerbated by reminders of the traumatic event. This syndrome, known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), shares commonalities with fear-related disorders like panic and phobia, and is characterized by persistent re-experiencing of traumatic emotion. Current treatments for PTSD confer some remission of symptoms, but do not work in some individuals, and frequently become ineffective over time due to relapse. Acquisition and attenuation of emotional responses can be modeled in the laboratory by Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction. These studies have suggested that one factor impeding recovery from PTSD may be exposure to stress-related neurotransmitters. The goal of this study is to define which cells and brain pathways mediate adverse effects of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. In preliminary experiments, we determined that noradrenaline signals through the a1 adrenoreceptor subtype to activate inhibitory neurons and increase their transmission in the amygdala, a critical brain region in fear conditioning and a site of abnormal activity in PTSD. Furthermore, we show that these receptors promote formation of fear memories that are resistant to extinction, a process for inhibiting fear that is analogous to exposure-based emotional therapies. The objective of this proposal is to define the specific circuit mechanisms that, when activated by noradrenaline, impede extinction. Our specific aims are 1. To establish the role of specific inhibitory cell types in noradrenaline-dependent circuit modifications, 2. To test the impact of these inhibitory neurons on behavioral flexibility, and 3. To establish circuit determinants of extinction success and failure. We will rely on transgenic mice, patch-clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics and chemicogenetics to accomplish these goals. The results of these experiments will define cell types as well as synaptic pathways at which improved therapies for attenuating emotion can be directed."

This goal will be met through two aims that will establish a Pilot Project Program (PPP) to support faculty, and a Postdoctoral Scholar Program (PSP) to support and mentor postdoctoral researchers. The PPP will provide preliminary support and mentoring to early career investigators and to established faculty who are changing research directions toward health equity research, with the objective of generating preliminary data that will increase investigators' competitiveness for NIH and other external health- and health equity-related research funding. Funds will be provided for new projects, and for the generation or analysis of data needed for proposal revision and resubmission. The PSP program will bring a cohort of postdoctoral scholars to NAU to conduct health equity-related research in the basic biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences. The IDC will work closely with the Administrative Core to provide mentoring opportunities; with the Research Infrastructure Core to enhance the quality of the research design and interpretation; and with the Community Engagement Core to develop meaningful health equity research projects that serve the needs of our community partners. The proposed outcome of this IDC is to create cohorts of health equity researchers whose interactions will be interdisciplinary and thus synergistic."
"9422280","Project Summary I am the Manager of the High Throughput Screening Facility (HTSF) at the NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC). The HTSF provides screening platforms and specialized instrumentation for increased experimental throughput. In particular, the HTSF allows investigators to utilize RNAi and compound libraries, and the specialized instrumentation required for large scale screening with these resources. I have been the Manager of the HTSF since its inception, and have guided the establishment and maintenance of every aspect of the facility. I managed the acquisition of a suite of HTS equipment and libraries, established all the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and created a working pipeline from assay development to statistical hit-picking for investigators. After the establishment of the HTSF under my management, on its first review by the NCI in 2010 as a proposed facility for addition to the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG), it was rated as ?Outstanding.? Overall, the vitality of the resource I have created for molecular screening is evidenced by forty-four publications that have utilized the HTSF between the years 2007- 2015. Within the most recent CCSG review period (2011-2014), there was a three-fold increase in the total number of publications over the first CCSG review period. During this time period, there was an average of over one thousand individual reservations for equipment use per annum. These data indicate that the resources I have established and continue to develop are robust and a pivotal scientific asset for the laboratories at FCCC. As technologies and research directions evolve, I have surveyed the faculty to identify new technology platforms for the HTSF, and I have led the preparation of two S10 shared instrumentation grants two successful S10 applications allowing the purchase of the Guava EasyCyte benchtop FACS, and a Luminex 100/200, multiplexing biomarker analyzer. The acquisition of this new technology platform will complement the resources available to screeners, but crucially allow the HTSF to serve investigators utilizing patient samples and animal models. My efforts supporting and implementing the technologies provided in the HTSF is crucial to their continued excellence and availability."
"9445145","Project Summary Abstract Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) frequently develops secondary to joint injury, with clinical manifestations of pain and dysfunction lagging months to years after the injury. No effective therapies exist to prevent or slow PTOA progression, and evidence indicates interventions must occur acutely after injury to modify the disease course. The novel peptide SS-31 is a highly targeted mitoprotective therapy that has shown success in clinical trials for treatment of several diseases. This project will test the hypothesis that acute mechanical trauma induces MT dysfunction in chondrocytes that leads to PTOA, and that restoring MT bioenergetics with SS-31 will arrest the development of PTOA in vivo. First, the early (seconds to days) temporal response of cartilage to injury with respect to MT function, cell death, and matrix degradation, will be assessed to identify a therapeutic window of time for treatment of MT dysfunction after mechanical injury of cartilage. Then, the efficacy of SS-31 in mitigating the effects of cartilage injury will be studied to identify the time course in which mitoprotection can effectively inhibit MT dysfunction, restore cellular bioenergetics and prevent cell death. Finally, the effects of mitochondrial stabilization on PTOA in vivo will be assessed in the peracute to chronic phases following impact-induced cartilage damage and MT dysfunction in vivo. The results of these studies will demonstrate if mitoprotective therapies restore mitochondrial bioenergetics, prevent acute cell injury and apoptosis, and inhibit the progression of cartilage degeneration, thereby providing the first therapy to prevent PTOA. All components of this proposal reflect and support the mission of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Completion of the proposed project will reveal novel scientific information about the early changes in cartilage at subcellular to macroscopic resolution scales after injury. Understanding the acute post-injury pathobiology of PTOA is critical because it represents a time point where true intervention, with an aim at preventing PTOA, is possible before the disease becomes fully established. The success of SS-31 in several phase II clinical trials, where disease is already established, suggests that mitoprotection will also be an effective therapy for PTOA in those cases where OA is present at the time of diagnosis and treatment. Two PhD students will be trained in this proposal with input from a multifaceted interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians from the human clinical and animal models perspectives. Finally, all members of the assembled team in this proposal are well represented on national and international levels in their respective fields, and they are dedicated and experienced at dissemination of scientific information at meetings and in journal publications. The interdisciplinary team assembled for this project has an established collaborative relationship and brings contemporary concepts and techniques from each respective field to translate information into a realistic human clinical application to prevent PTOA."

"9468920","Project Summary Despite decades of concentrated efforts across myriad sectors, childhood obesity remains a prevailing public health problem, and certain subpopulations, including racial and ethnic minorities and those living in low-income households, are disproportionately affected. Obese children are at higher risk for low quality of life and chronic disease diagnosis, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, in adulthood. Obesity is a complex disease with many influencing factors across the socio-ecological model, including individual, intrapersonal, environmental, policy, and systems-level factors. These factors vary across different social and cultural contexts, further complicating solutions to this widespread public health problem. Eliminating or reducing the childhood obesity burden will likely require a better understanding of not only which intervention strategies are effective to combat these influencing factors, but also whether these strategies can be similarly effective when translated across diverse cultures and contexts. To reach this understanding, researchers, interventionists, and practitioners will need to possess a unique analytic skillset, engage collaborators across multiple sectors, and demonstrate cultural sensitivity. The proposed training plan is designed to address these needs. First, the training plan incorporates cultural competency and health equity training. Second, it involves assembly of a mentoring and advisory team of scientists across disciplines (psychology, nutrition, communications, epidemiology, education). Third, it incorporates didactic training in multi-level modeling and mixed methods data analysis. Finally, the proposed research study allows for application of skills acquired through the training plan. The proposed research study examines the individual and environmental impact of Student Wellness Champions for Change, a health literacy, public health literacy, and youth advocacy-based intervention designed to engage student-led wellness teams in improving school wellness policy implementation and creating health-promoting environments in elementary and middle schools across Maryland. The project uses a rigorous mixed methods evaluation and the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework to assess (1) the extent to which involvement on student wellness teams improve students? individual health behaviors, weight status, health and public health literacy, and youth advocacy skills; (2) the extent to which student wellness teams make environmental changes in their school. Additionally, the study aims to describe factors, including reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance, that are necessary to inform translation of this intervention strategy to diverse schools across Maryland and beyond."
"9339560","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Dopamine release from neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) assists in learning goal-oriented behaviors and mediates the pleasurable aspects of most drugs of abuse. Understanding how the excitability of VTA neurons is regulated by synaptic inputs and membrane properties is crucial if one is to understand how dopamine release is controlled. 5'-Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master enzyme that regulates cellular metabolism. When activated by a falling AMP/ATP ratio, AMPK promotes biochemical pathways that increase energy production while reducing energy expenditure. Although AMPK is widely regarded as an energy sensor, recent studies suggest it also influences neuronal excitability. Preliminary data from our lab suggest that activators of AMPK potentiate the hyperpolarizing current evoked by ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) channels, reduce the desensitization of dopamine D2 autoreceptors, and inhibit the influence of excitatory synaptic transmission in VTA neurons. The over-arching hypothesis of our proposed studies is that AMPK activation augments inhibitory influences on VTA neurons. Patch pipettes will be used to record whole-cell currents and potentials in single VTA neurons in slices of rat midbrain. Western immunoblot will be used to quantify levels of phosphorylated and total AMPK in midbrain slices that have been incubated in the presence and absence of AMPK activators and/or inhibitors. Aim #1 will characterize the effect of AMPK activators on currents evoked by the K-ATP opener diazoxide. Aim #2 will investigate second messenger systems and identify transmitter receptors that mediate the ability of AMPK activators to reduce dopamine D2 autoreceptor desensitization. Aim #3 will investigate mechanisms and sites of action by which AMPK inhibits glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission in the VTA. Aim #4 will characterize mechanisms by which AMPK activation inhibits burst firing in VTA dopamine neurons. Results of these studies may suggest new pharmacological strategies for treating dopamine-dependent disorders."
"9543048","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The non-invasive diagnosis of human glioma could improve the quality of life of patients with this disease by allowing patients to be directly diagnosed or stratified for treatment without the need of an invasive brain biopsy. In this study, the investigators propose to develop novel extracellular RNA biomarkers for the diagnosis of human glioma tumors. Using a prioritized panel of tumor specific extracellular RNA (exRNA) genetic changes, we will test different competing technologies (qPCR, digital PCR, exome sequencing, and DMR) for detecting exRNA candidate biomarkers in blood and CSF of glioma patients.  In the UH3 phase of study, we will create a consortium of institutions to provide rapid prospective collection of tumor tissue CSF, and blood from glioma patients and establish common protocols for CSF and blood collection to support clinical diagnostic glioma exRNA assays. We will then validate the diagnosis of glioma by exRNA using blood or CSF exRNA assays (as prioritized from the UH2 phase) and tested in two clinical patient population; 1) suspected low grade and 2) suspected high grade glioma. Prototypical markers that will be tested will include the detection of IDH1 mutations in low grade tumors and EGFRvIII in high grade tumors. We anticipate the ability to determine the sensitivity and specificity with which a CSF or blood test can be used to diagnosis human glioma. We further anticipate that in patients with difficult to biopsy tumors, the results o this study will yield a method for diagnosing brain tumors non-invasively thus reducing the need for invasive brain surgery and appropriately stratifying patients for targeted therapies."
"9539045","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic signaling pathways are often regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Appropriate control of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for cellular homeostasis. Mutations or altered expression of PTKs or PTPs have been implicated in hematologic malignancies. Deletion of the human chromosome 20q [del(20q)] is a recurring chromosomal abnormality observed in ~10% patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. However, the target genes within 20q associated with myeloid malignancies remain unknown. Interestingly, the PTPN1 gene is located to human chromosome 20q13, which lies within the commonly deleted region in myeloid malignancies. PTPN1 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, which negatively regulates JAK2. An acquired JAK2V617F mutation was identified in a large number of patients with MPNs. Interestingly, a significant proportion of del(20q) positive MPN patients also carry the JAK2V617F mutation. We have found that knockdown of PTPN1 enhances hematopoietic signaling including the JAK2/Stat5 pathway, and increases the cell growth. We also have observed that deletion of PTPN1 results in expansion of myeloid cells and enlargement of spleens in mice. We hypothesize that PTPN1 may act as a tumor suppressor in myeloid malignancies. We propose to use genetic and biochemical approaches to delineate the role of PTPN1 in myeloid malignancies. In Aim 1, using a conditional PTPN1 knockout allele, we will determine the effects of PTPN1 deletion on hematopoietic compartments. In Aim 2, we will determine if PTPN1 deficiency cooperates with JAK2V617F in myeloid malignancies. In Aim 3, we will determine the effects of PTPN1 deficiency on hematopoietic signaling and define the mechanism by which PTPN1 deficiency contributes to myeloid malignancies. These studies should provide important new insights into the role of PTPN1 in hematopoiesis and determine if PTPN1 functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor in myeloid malignancies. Results from these studies may lead to new therapeutic approach for myeloid malignancies."

As a public health nurse and epidemiologist, Dr. Barcelona de Mendoza has a strong clinical and research background in perinatal and reproductive health and health disparities. The candidate proposes to expand her knowledge base to include genetic epidemiology and cardiovascular genomics through participation in courses and training programs in genetic data analysis and quantitative genetics. Long-term goals include (a) examination of health disparities in maternal/child health from a life course perspective, (b) utilization of an epigenomic approach in the reduction of reproductive health disparities, and (c) investigation of the associations between cardiovascular health, genomics and reproductive health, with a life course focus. In order to achieve these long-term goals, Dr. Barcelona de Mendoza proposes to study the associations of DNA methylation, obesity and preterm birth on blood pressure in African American children. The proposed project will recruit participants from an ongoing R01 cohort study examining the interaction between genomic and environmental stressors on blood pressure in African American mothers and children. The project's specific aims are to: (1) Examine how DNAm of candidate genes mediates the association between preterm birth and blood pressure among 3-5 year old African American children (2) Investigate how DNAm of candidate genes mediates the association between BMI and blood pressure in African American children, and (3) repeat epigenetic analyses to examine the association between DNAm, PTB and BMI on BP over time (approximately two years) (exploratory aim). Yale University provides a rich and supportive research environment for the candidate to conduct this study. Under the excellent mentorship of Drs. Jackie Taylor (genomics), Yan Sun (statistical genetics), Andrew DeWan (genetic epidemiology) and Ann Kurth (reproductive health), the candidate will receive the necessary support to complete this project. This project is in line with the NINR's key theme of ?Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness?, and the cross-cutting area of ?Promoting Innovation? through personalized medicine and genomics. These strategic themes are addressed in this project by investigating the physical and environmental causes of health disparities in preterm birth and cardiovascular disease as major contributors of morbidity and mortality within a high risk racial/ethnic minority group. The candidate will build upon previous work in perinatal health disparities by adding advanced training in molecular genetics, genetic epidemiology and quantitative genetics, expanding the lens through which to study the public health problem of preterm birth. By receiving the additional training and excellent mentorship outlined in this proposal, Dr. Barcelona de Mendoza will be well-prepared as a successful independent investigator to reduce maternal/child health disparities."

"9471561","In the United States, one in three adults will develop hypertension and require antihypertensive treatments in their lifetime. Yet only 1/2 of hypertensive patients respond to current antihypertensive drugs, and 1/3 of hypertensive patients will continue to develop cardiovascular and renal complications. The mechanisms underlying poorly controlled hypertension in response to current antihypertensive therapies remain incompletely understood. Supported by NIDDK grants, we have established that: 1) circulating and tissue ANG II is taken up by the proximal tubule (PT) via AT1a receptor-, the endocytic receptor megalin-, or caveolin 1- dependent mechanisms; 2) internalized ANG II and AT1 (AT1a) receptors are localized in the endosomes and nuclei of PT cells; 3) intracellular microinjection of ANG II increases [Ca ]i, whereas exposure of freshly 2+ isolated renal cortical nuclei with ANG II induces transcriptional TGF-?1, MCP-1, and the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) responses via AT1a receptors; 4) in vitro or intrarenal adenovirus-mediated overexpression of an intracellular ANG II fusion protein with AT1a receptors selectively in the PT induces NHE3 expression, promotes Na+ reabsorption, and increases blood pressure, and 5) global- or kidney-selective deletion of NHE3 attenuates ANG II-induced hypertension. These studies strongly suggest that intracellular ANG II may play an important role in the regulation of Na+ transport in the PT and blood pressure homeostasis. In this A1 revised proposal, we will test a new hypothesis that in the PT of the kidney, ANG II and AT1 (AT1a) are internalized into the mitochondria, where mito-ANG II exerts dual roles on the mitochondrial function via activation of the AT1a/Ca2+/NADPH oxidase/O2.- and the AT2/eNOS/NO/cGMP signaling pathways. Activation of the AT1a/ Ca2+/NADPH oxidase/O2.- pathway induces mitochondrial respiratory and glycolysis stress, impairs pressure natriuresis response, and increases blood pressure, whereas activation of the mitochondrial AT2/eNOS/NO/cGMP pathway by ANG II promotes pressure natriuresis and lowers blood pressure. In Aim 1, we will use high resolution electron microscopic autoradiography and intravital multiphoton imaging to determine whether AT1 (AT1a) and AT2 receptors are localized in the mitochondria of the PT, and whether [125I]- ANG II or Alexa 488-ANG II is internalized into the mitochondria of the PT in mice. In Aim II, we will determine whether overexpression of a mitochondria-targeting mito-ANG II in PT cells impairs mitochondrial function by activating the AT1a/Ca2+/NADPH oxidase/O2.- signaling pathways, whereas overexpression of mito-AT2R protects mitochondrial function by activating the AT2/eNOS/NO/cGMP signaling. The PT-specific sglt2 promoter and the mitochondria-targeting sequence will be used to drive the overexpression of mito-ANG II, mito-AT1aR or mito-AT2R in PT cells. In Aim III, we will determine whether activation of mito-AT1aR by mito-ANG II in the PT induces mitochondrial respiratory and glycolysis stress, impairs pressure natriuresis responses, and increases blood pressure using specific PT-AT1a-KO, PT-AT2-KO, PT-NHE3-KO, or PT-SIRT3-KO mice, respectively."

"9508669","Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases."

"9362260","Project Summary  Despite notable improvements in early detection and therapeutic options, breast cancer has persisted in leading the United States in cancer related mortalities, taking the lives of more than 40,000 Americans each year. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have been approved as targeted therapies for a number of cancers, which include lung and colorectal cancers, but have seen limited success for breast cancer. In theory, EGFR was identified as a target of interest for breast cancer therapy because its expression levels are negatively correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes and it is highly expressed in many breast cancer cases. However, in practice, it was noted that only a small fraction of patients responded positively to EGFR inhibitor treatment, with many developing resistance to the inhibitors. Fortunately, current research efforts have revealed that this resistance may be attributed to the activity of other receptor tyrosine kinases. Through the support of our own preliminary data, we hypothesize that receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is one of the major contributors to EGFR resistance in triple-negative breast cancer patients, likely through activation of YAP pathway. The ligand-bound ROR1 associates with HER3 to trigger previous unidentified signaling cascades, leading to activation of YAP-target transcriptional program. Additionally, the expression of ROR1 and status of HER3 phosphorylation are correlated with unfavorable outcomes for breast cancer patients, and knock out of ROR1 inhibited metastasis of TNBC in preclinical models.  Our central hypothesis is that ROR1/HER3-triggered activation of the YAP pathway promotes distal metastasis of TNBC and resistance to EGFR-target therapy. We will address this hypothesis according to the following 3 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will demonstrate the functional role of the ROR1/HER3 signaling axis in metastatic TNBC. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanism that underlies the ROR1- mediated signaling pathway to activate the YAP target transcriptional program. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the preclinical benefits of targeting ROR1/YAP in combination with EGFR inhibitors.  EGFR inhibitor treatment has been successfully implemented into the care plans of patients with a variety of cancer types. However, EGFR inhibitor treatment has only been marginally successful for TNBC patients. The proposed research will investigate the effectiveness of targeting the ROR1/YAP signaling pathway in circumventing resistance to EGFR inhibitors and thus improving response to the widely used inhibitors. The research team will rely on high-throughput sequencing, biochemistry, molecular biology, and xenograft mouse models to comprehensively assess a co-targeting strategy that involves EGFR and ROR1/YAP to help provide the scientific basis for a successful treatment approach for patients with TNBC."
"9566804","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Spinal cord ischemia results in life-changing paralysis and paraparesis after major vascular, spine and spinal cord surgery, and spine trauma. Methods currently employed to detect spinal cord ischemia are based upon electrophysiology, monitoring the effect of ischemia upon electrical signal transmission. Degradation of these signals requires ionic gradients to fail, and cell death to begin. The current  technology is therefore indirect and temporally delayed. It has also been proven to lack the specificity and reliability desired to avert such a devastating consequence as paralysis or paraparesis.  We have developed a prototypical fiber optic device, based on Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) and Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy (DOS) principles, that permits rapid detection and continuous monitoring of changes in spinal cord blood flow and oxygenation. This novel device is an important step forward for neurophysiological monitoring, offering a new level of accuracy and immediacy for intraoperative detection of spinal cord ischemia and in the neurocritical care setting. This device may one day enable continuous, bedside, user friendly monitoring for spinal cord ischemia by anesthesiologists, neurointensivists, emergency, and nursing personnel. Specific Aims: Aim 1) To design and produce a second generation multi-level spinal cord fiber-optic probe, capable of axially discriminating ischemic disturbances across multiple vertebral regions in the spinal cord. Aim 2) To continue to develop and optimize a real-time fiber optic monitoring platform for the monitoring of spinal cord blood flow and oxygenation. Aim 3) To conduct preliminary bench and pre-clinical testing of the second generation multi- level probes and PXI-platform real-time monitor. Aim 4) To design and produce a compact, portable, user friendly, DCS/DOS monitor, capable of being used at the bedside. Aim 5) To complete bench and pre-clinical testing of the second generation probes and monitor."
"9473317","Project Summary The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system has become widely adopted for DNA recognition, enabling applications such as genome editing and recruiting effector proteins to DNA to affect transcription or enable imaging. Recently in Nelles et al, Cell, 2016, we showed that with modifications, catalytically dead Cas9 with a modified oligonucleotide containing the PAM recognition sequence is able to bind specific mRNAs in living mammalian cells and is able to track their movement, opening up the potential for many RNA applications of Cas proteins. In this proposal, we aim at developing a adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based therapeutic strategy for myotonic dystrophy, a microsatellite expansion disease characterized by expanded CTG repeats, using RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas9 (RCas9). We will perform in vivo safety and efficacy studies of our AAV-based therapy and evaluate the hypothesis that alternative RNA processing biomarkers are reliable for measuring treatment efficacy of RCas9 in myotonic dystrophy. If successful, we will have taken a significant step forward in developing a treatment for a class of microsatellite expansion diseases.!"
"9359227","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances have credentialed immunotherapy as a potent anti-cancer treatment modality. However, with exception of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB), immunotherapy has not yet been shown to improve outcomes for children with solid tumors. For patients with NB undergoing myeloablative therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, subsequent treatment with dinutuximab, which targets disialoganglioside (GD2) on NB cells, improves 2-year event-free survival from 465% to 665%. However, 40% of patients relapse during or after receiving dinutuximab; regimen-related toxicity is high; and 15% of patients have early disease progression and do not receive this therapy. Other immunotherapies include adoptive cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells and checkpoint inhibition with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). CAR T cells have potent activity against pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia but have not yet demonstrated activity against solid tumors. Checkpoint inhibition alone (e.g., anti- PD-1 mAb) may not have significant anti-NB activity due to its efficacy correlating with the frequent tumor cell mutations and to the paucity of mutations in NB. Our strategy focuses on cell and mAb based immunotherapies for NB that does not require high-level inherent immunogenicity and builds upon recent advances in our understanding of the tumor cell:immune system interface. We hypothesize that therapeutic gains will be greatest if strategies both enhance cell intrinsic functions of CAR T cells and activated NK (aNK) cells, and overcome cell extrinsic immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our Specific Aims are to enhance the potency and durability of CAR T cells and aNK cells and to develop regimens that combine enhanced cell therapies with modulation of the immunosuppressive TME. Our Research Strategy/Approach is 1) to enhance the potency and durability of GD2-CARs using targeted mutagenesis of the scFv to prevent antigen-independent tonic signaling and exhaustion originating from the scFv; to test a novel B7-H3-CAR with demonstrated activity; and to add PD-1 blockade to enhance potency and limit exhaustion; 2) to increase trafficking, persistence and potency of aNK cells by combining them with anti-GD2 and anti-B7-H3 mAbs and with a superagonist IL-15; and 3) to overcome immune suppression in the TME with an anti-CD105 mAb to suppress/eliminate mesenchymal stroma and endothelial cells, with a CSF1R inhibitor to eliminate suppressive MDSC and TAMs (collaboration with Project 4), with a TGFBR1 inhibitor to prevent suppression by TGF?1, and with a FAK/ALK inhibitor to overcome FAK-based induction of T cell suppression and exhaustion (collaboration with Project 1). In summary, novel approaches to enhance the potency and durability of adoptive T cell and NK cell therapies will be developed for translation into clinical trials conducted by Core B (NANT consortium) for patients with high-risk NB."

"9407690","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT . Bladder cancer is a leading cause of death in the US and the most expensive cancer to treat. Despite this, there has been only one new bladder cancer therapy, the checkpoint inhibitor atezoluzimab, approved in the past 30 years. Oncolytic viruses, viruses that selectively infect and kill cancer cells, are a potent new class of immunotherapy that mediate anticancer activity by direct virus induced killing and robust activation of immune responses against tumor associated antigens. Vyriad's lead oncolytic measles virus product, MV-NIS, has shown clinical safety and efficacy following intravenous and intraperitoneal treatment in patients with advanced multiple myeloma and ovarian cancer respectively and potently kills bladder cancer cell lines in in vitro studies. Our goal is to develop oncolytic MV-NIS as a new treatment for bladder cancer, a malignancy that has demonstrated susceptibility to immunotherapy. A majority of patients are diagnosed with non-muscle invasive disease (NMIBC), of which approximately 50% of patients fail first line therapy. These patients, and patients with muscle invasive disease (MIBC), have no effective therapeutic options and facing the likelihood of disease progression or metastasis,often undergo radical cystectomy (complete bladder removal) which significantly impacts quality of life. In this SBIR fast-track application we propose to (I) confirm feasibility and identify optimal conditions for intravesical administration of MV-NIS and (II) carry out a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate intravesical MV-NIS therapy in patients scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy. This study will provide the critical demonstration of feasibility and safety of intravesical MV-NIS administration, as well preliminary indication of therapeutic efficacy to inform the decision to advance MV-NIS therapy in a pivotal clinical trial to seek approval as a novel bladder cancer therapy. We utilize an innovative clinical trial design that allows correlative analysis to define mechanism of action of MV-NIS therapy including characterization of antitumor immune responses. This will inform future studies to combine MV-NIS therapy with approved checkpoint inhibitors to potentially develop a more potent therapeutic approach for patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. We are bringing together Vyriad's team, leading experts in oncolytic virotherapy development, with Mayo Clinic's nationally number one ranked Urology department, to perform this study that will, if successful, lead to the approval of a new, much-needed treatment for bladder cancer patients."
"9358860","ABSTRACT The Biomarker and Constituent Core (Core B) will carry out analyses of tobacco constituents in the smoke of commercial and research cigarettes, as well as in e-cigarettes, used in studies proposed by individual projects, and will analyze a panel of biomarkers in biological samples collected from users of these products. These analyses will enable the assessment of the public health impact of removing filter ventilation, as proposed in this program. The Core will employ well-established robust protocols based on standardized methodologies for the analyses of tobacco constituents and biomarkers, and will also apply some recently developed innovative methodologies for the analysis of cigarette smoke and novel biomarkers. For product analyses, smoke of commercial and research cigarettes will be analyzed for nicotine and a range of key toxicants and carcinogens (tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds), filter ventilation and other cigarette physical parameters will be determined, and the differences in constituent distribution across various smoke particle sizes from ventilated and non-ventilated cigarettes will be assessed. Spent filters from cigarettes smoked by study participants will be also analyzed to correlate mouth-level constituent exposures with smoking topography measures, biomarker levels, and/or sensory perceptions. The Core will also generate cigarette smoke and e-cigarette aerosol extracts for the use in the animal behavioral studies proposed in one of the projects, and will analyze nicotine and other constituents that may contribute to abuse liability of tobacco products, such as minor alkaloids, ?-carbolines, and aldehydes. Biomarkers of specific smoke constituents to be analyzed by Core B include urinary levels of total nicotine equivalents (nicotine intake), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and its N- and O-glucuronides (exposure to tobacco-specific lung carcinogen NNK), the tobacco specific oral and esophageal carcinogen N?- nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and its N-glucuronide, phenanthrene tetraol and 3-hydroxy phenanthrene (exposure to and metabolism of the representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene), and mercapturic acids (exposure to acrolein and crotonaldehyde), and DNA adducts N6-hydroxymethyl-deoxyadenosine and N2-ethylidene-deoxyguanosine derived from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, respectively. Lung and systemic inflammatory processes will be assessed by analyzing inflammatory cell counts, cytokines, and gene expression profiles in bronchoscopy samples, 8-oxo-dG and 8-oxo-dA in leukocyte DNA, and PGEM and 8-iso- PGF2? in urine. In addition, untargeted metabolomics will be employed for the analysis of urine and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids to identify novel biomarker profiles distinguishing exposures from ventilated and non-ventilated cigarettes. Personnel in this Core have extensive experience in clinical trials and quantitation tobacco constituents and biomarkers, and were the first to develop many of the methodologies that will be used in this Core. Availability of the accurate, robust, and uniform measures of tobacco constituent exposures and of the effects caused by these exposures, as proposed in this Core, is critical for the conduct of studies proposed by individual projects and for the overall success of this program."
"9419140","SUMMARY This five-year U54 proposal is a collaborative, inter-institutional partnership between South Carolina State University (SCSU), an Historically Black University (HBCU), and the Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC-HCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. The partnership began in 2011 under the auspices of an NCI P20 CPACHE grant and has grown to produce this U54 South Carolina Cancer Disparities Research Center (SC CADRE) application. With input from their joint community partner, the Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg Mabry Cancer Center (RMC-MCC), investigators at both institutions collaborated to design the SC CADRE. The overarching goals of the SC CADRE are to increase SCSU's capacity to conduct transdisciplinary cancer research and to further strengthen and extend a longitudinal research education pipeline that will catalyze a new diverse generation of biomedical researchers focused on cancer disparities. The SC CADRE has three major themes. The first focuses on evaluating the relationship between obesity and prostate and breast cancer disparities. The second theme emphasizes evaluation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) as a novel biomarker related to cancer, cancer disparities, and obesity. The third theme highlights the inclusion of a population unique to the US southeastern coastal region, the Sea Island (SI)/Gullah population. Within five years, the SC CADRE aims for: 1) further elucidation of molecular mechanisms contributing to cancer disparities; 2) an enhanced pipeline of diverse cancer researchers; 3) an increased number of NIH research proposals led by SCSU faculty as independent investigators; and 4) greater community engagement in cancer research. Due to the longstanding SCSU /MUSC-HCC academic partnership and each entity's research and educational strengths and community relationships, the SC CADRE is poised to transform cancer health outcomes for South Carolinians."
"9362165","Project Summary: Strong epidemiological evidence linking schizophrenia (SCZ) and cannabis suggests that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system plays a key role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Early cannabis use increases the risk of developing SCZ by almost twofold, making cannabis a strong risk factor for SCZ [59,60], acting through an unknown molecular mechanism. Understanding the neuropathology of the early course of SCZ such as First Episode Psychosis (FEP) and the state of clinical high risk (CHR) that precedes FEP is critically needed to identify new therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of eCBs such as anandamide (AEA) setting the tone of the eCB, tightly regulating brain levels. In humans, dramatic elevations (up to eightfold) of AEA were detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SCZ and first episode psychosis (FEP) [91,92], and importantly in CHR [136], suggesting the presence of altered eCB metabolism (reduced FAAH) early in the course of SCZ, including its high risk states. However, no study has investigated FAAH, the eCB gatekeeping enzyme, in-vivo in brain in FEP or CHR, and its relationship with behavior and cognition is currently unknown. Our team has synthesized [11C]CURB and demonstrated its excellent properties for selective and reliable PET brain imaging of FAAH [172]. We also established the safety, validation and dosimetry of [11C]CURB as well as its reproducible quantifiability [177,179]. Thus, the overall aim of our proposal is to use [11C]CURB to image the eCB enzyme FAAH using PET with a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) in antipsychotic-free patients with FEP and CHR. One hundred and fifty participants (n=50 FEP, n=50 CHR and n=50 HV) will be included to test our hypothesis. This study will help us understand a) whether there are changes in FAAH in the early course of disease (FEP<CHR<HV), b) explore for the first time the role of brain FAAH in behavior and cognition. We believe this study will provide novel treatment targets (i.e. FAAH to regulate eCBs) to treat or perhaps even delay or abort transition to SCZ in those at risk. Our preliminary [11C]CURB data in FEP, CHR and HV suggest the first evidence of reduced AEA metabolism (reduced brain FAAH) early in the course of disease consistent with our hypothesis (FEP<CHR<HV), and congruent with our preliminary data in (treated) SCZ patients. The PI and her colleagues have a considerable track record of performing complex molecular PET imaging studies in FEP and CHR subjects [65,181-184]. The high resolution PET scanner, well characterized radiotracer and the infrastructure for neurobiological research in CHR and FEP are novel aspects of the project that will provide a fundamental basis for future studies of pharmacologic interventions in CHR and FEP focused on eCB to treat FEP or even prevent SCZ in CHR."

"9282192","Sepsis is systemic infection accompanied by an uncontrolled inflammatory response; a condition that can deteriorate rapidly. Early diagnosis is critical for survival. Heart rate variability (HRV), a proposed biomarker for sepsis, predicts its prognosis but is too nonspecific to make a diagnosis. Often HRV is quantified by its power spectra, its variability in the frequency domain; the `high-frequency' component reflects respiratory modulation of vagal nerve activity. Computational deterministic models of the brainstem cardiorespiratory control networks have proposed plausible neural mechanisms for the vago-respiratory coupling. In contrast to HRV, Dynamic Network Analysis (DyNA) and Dynamic Bayesian Network (DyBN) models are highly specific and successful in identifying a `tipping point' in sepsis, i.e. when a controlled inflammatory response becomes uncontrolled but its many variables are hard to measure. Recently, we identified that the brainstem becomes inflamed in endotoxemia. We hypothesize that progressive inflammation is a critical factor in losing HRV, ventilatory pattern variability (VPV), and cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) associated with sepsis. We propose to build on the strengths of agent-based and computational modeling approaches and perform model-driven experiments to determine how alterations of brainstem neurophysiology in sepsis limit physiologic pattern variability. Our preliminary data show that endotoxemic rats lose CRC progressively in association with proinflammatory cytokines expression first in the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS) then in the nucleus Ambiguus. Further, consistent with a progressive loss of CRC focal IL-1? microinjections in the nTS uncouples the arterial pulse pressure's influence on respiration leaving RSA intact. The Specific Aims are: 1) to develop DyNa and DyBN models of cytokine expression in brainstem cardiorespiratory control nuclei during septicemia to determine if central and peripheral inflammation patterns, 2) to adapt these models to critically-ill humans at risk for sepsis and probe the robustness of the model by applying therapeutic interventions in rats, and 3) to apply our control model to propose plausible and testable mechanisms for the effects of cytokines on the function of cardiorespiratory control circuitry. Our computational model of the neural control of cardiorespiratory coupling as well as the models defining the interactions among cytokines in tissue inflammation have been applied successfully to other conditions (sympatho-respiratory coupling) or to peripheral tissues (cytokine expression and interaction). Integrating these models will provide cross-scale mechanistic explanations for the loss of RSA and CVC observed during sepsis, identify critical cytokines for therapeutic intervention, and will establish a scientific rationale for using CRC and variability measures as complementary and sensitive biomarkers of sepsis."
"9421433","Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal,  Regulatory role of long noncoding RNAs in normal and cancer cells?, is being submitted in response to PAR-17-049, Research Specialist (laboratory-based Scientists) Award (R50), from the National Cancer Institute. The Award is designed to encourage the development of stable research career opportunities for exceptional scientists who want to pursue research within the context of an existing cancer research program, but not serve as independent investigators. This proposal is built on the Outstanding Investigator Award (R35) received by Dr. Daniel G. Tenen in response to PAR-14-267 and entitled Mechanisms of regulation by RNA in acute myeloid leukemia?.  In recent years researchers have revealed that a large portion of the genome of complex organisms are transcribed but not translated. These noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) provide an additional and relatively unexplored layer of control to many biological processes. The overall goal of the R35 proposal is to investigate underexplored aspects of RNA control in cancer, using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a model of study.  The contribution of the Research Scientist will aim at understanding, in the context of a cancer environment, the mechanistic role played by RNAs, by addressing the following areas: (1) the study of a noncoding RNA which limits expression of the tumor suppressor gene PU.1, particularly in a specific subsets of leukemias; and (2) the ability of ncRNA to regulate epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, with the ultimate goal of developing gene-selective demethylating tools as well as identifying other epigenetic marks regulated by ncRNAs. These studies will, in every instance, seek to investigate the role of ncRNAs in cancer, as well as potential development of more specific therapeutic modalities.  In addition, to the goals listed in the Dr. Tenen?s R35 proposal, I propose to extend the studies within the following research areas: (i) Understanding the role of lncRNAs in maintaining stability of genomic DNA; (ii) Understanding the role of lncRNAs in formation of transcriptionally active chromatin; and (iii) Identification of lncRNAs involved in maintaining stability of the genomic DNA in acute myeloid leukemia.  Fulfilment of these new directions will be a logical continuation of the ideas proposed in Dr. Tenen?s application and might pave the way for the future translational efforts."

"9406664","The purpose of this proposal is to respond to RFA-HD-17-006 by continuing a multidisciplinary research center on learning disabilities (LDs), the Texas Center for Learning Disabilities. Consistent with the goals of RFA, we focus in Years 11-16 on persistent reading difficulties in a historically underserved group, English learners (Els). We characterize the sample as a complex phenotype and evaluate variations in math and written expression, as well as ADHD behavior and language proficiency. The proposed research uses multiple methodologies from cognitive and educational science, neuroimaging, genetics, and contemporary methodologies. The central theme is that instructional response operationalizes the historically prominent component of the LD construct, ?unexpected underachievement.? Instructional response must be evaluated in children broadly representative of diverse backgrounds who are persistently impaired in academic skills and respond inadequately to instruction. To establish a reliable and valid classification of LDs, and understand cognitive, linguistic, neural, and genetic influences on LDs and instructional response, individual differences in instructional response should be systematically studied from multidisciplinary perspectives. We propose 5 Projects and 4 Cores. Project 1 (Integration) continues the past 5 years of integrative research on classification issues through evaluation of actual and simulated data, but in an El sample. It synthesizes empirical literature and conducts cross-project analyses. Project 2 (Attention) evaluates behavioral and cognitive attention and related skills over time in parallel with Projects 3, 4, and 5. It also introduces a measurement study to define attention as a construct and conducts 3 design experiments on attention in LDs. Project 3 (Intervention) builds on the previous 10 years of intervention research with a two-year double-cohort randomized controlled trial addressing reading comprehension in 820 Grade 7 Els with persistent reading difficulties. Project 4 (Neuroimaging) provides multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging studies of children who respond adequately and inadequately to Project 3 interventions. Project 5 (Epigenetics) is the high risk high reward study that evaluates epigenetic changes in DNA methylation in response to intervention in 672 participants from Project 2 (Attention) and Project 3 (Intervention). Support comes from the Administration Core (A), the Engagement Core (B), the Data Management & Statistics Core (C), and the Assessment & Recruitment Core (D). Training and dissemination opportunities are embedded throughout the Center, which has produced numerous trainees and 114 publications in the past 5 years. Synergy and cohesiveness emerges from common studies of the same cohort of Els through Project 3 (Intervention), with three shared assessments of a subset of these participants and typically developing comparison children in Projects 2 (Attention), 4 (Neuroimaging), and 5 (Epigenetics). The TCLD is a well-organized and cohesive multi-disciplinary Center that conducts synergistic research on fundamental issues involving LDs."
"9562467","PROJECT SUMMARY  Increasingly, the effective translation of groundbreaking biomedical discoveries and successful adoption of evidence-based therapies and interventions aimed to improve population health and reduce health disparities requires the coordinated efforts of multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral partnerships with diverse expertise, interests, and skills. The New York University (NYU)-Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) represents an innovative public-private research partnership designed to foster clinical and translational research and transform the delivery of care in clinical and community practice. With this application, we have assembled a partnership of institutions with unique and complementary strengths: a private research university with a history of public service and substantial biomedical, behavioral, and population health expertise (NYU), the largest municipal healthcare system in the United States (HHC), a state psychiatric institute (Nathan Kline Institute), and various community organizations that represent the rich diversity of populations in NYC. As the centralized hub, our CTSI catalyzes research and facilitates access to essential core services, resources, and expertise necessary to engage in the full spectrum of clinical and translational research across our partner institutions. Moreover, the CTSI serves as a nexus for collaboration between investigators at our partner institutions and the nationwide network of CTSA hubs. We will build on our success in markedly expanding clinical and translational research at our hub and an established history of research collaboration between NYU and HHC to further accelerate the pace and impact of discovery, development, validation, and implementation across the full spectrum of translational research. To accomplish this goal, we propose an array of innovative and evidence-based strategies delineated in our application, all within the framework of six overarching Specific Aims. 1) Catalyze and support innovative, collaborative translational research that improves health across the lifespan in our diverse communities. 2) Ensure the quality, safety, and efficiency of local clinical and translational research and to disseminate successful approaches. 3) Stimulate, support, and disseminate innovative methods in the clinical and translational sciences. 4) Foster community-engaged collaborative and team-based science among our diverse community of investigators and stakeholders, rich array of partner institutions, and the national CTSA network. 5) Educate, train, and cultivate the next generation of the translational research workforce. 6) Integrate our clinical, education, and research missions and operations to foster a learning healthcare system."
"9406665","The overarching theme of Project 1 (Integration) is integration, with the following objectives: (a) to continue research on the classification and identification of children with learning disabilities (LDs) using statistical simulation and real data (b) to extend this work to English learners (Els), and (c) to expand the use of meta- analysis and extend previous syntheses to co-morbid disabilities and to Els. The activities integrate research across projects, approaches, frameworks, settings, and populations. With this overarching purpose of Integration and these stated objectives, Project 1 has three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (Classification and Identification) addresses the challenges inherent in the identification and classification of LDs, targeting a historical mismatch permeating the literature between approach (dimensional) and framework (categorical). Project 1 seeks to investigate the inherent nature of LDs as either dimensional or non-dimensional while moving beyond current approaches to identification to develop and evaluate new approaches that overcome the known problems with existing approaches. Aim 1 draws on simulated data and actual data from Projects 2- 4 in the prior and current awards, and Projects 1 (Classification) and 3 (Remediation) from the first award. New methods include (a) latent variable models appropriate for categorical and dimensional frameworks, and (b) a reframing of RTI in terms of expected magnitude of response to instruction, consistent with a dimensional view of LDs. We expect to find support for our reconceptualization of RTI in terms of expected magnitude of response that is consistent with ideas from personalized medicine as applied to student learning and instruction. In addition, application of these methods to a large sample of Els will address fundamental questions of how to identify LDs in Els with persistent academic difficulties. Specific Aim 2 (External Validity of Identification Methods) addresses the validity of the identification and classification methods developed and tested under Aim 1. Using data collected under Projects 2 (Attention), 4 (Neuroimaging), and 5 (Epigenetics), we will compare children from Project 3 (Intervention) identified using different methods under Aim 1 on measures of attention, written expression, math, and other domains, including measures of neural response and epigenetics. We will also work with Project 4 (Neuroimaging) to develop a measure of neural specificity to use in external validation of identifications and to characterize RTI. Specific Aim 3 (Synthesis) continues and expands our work on empirical synthesis from the previous five years. We propose to undertake meta-analytic work addressing (a) the history of LD identification drawing on our prior 100 year review (Scammacca, et al., 2016), (b) predictors of intervention response in comorbid disabilities; (c) cognitive similarities and differences between comorbid and singular disabilities, including multiple academic domains with and without ADD/ADHD; (d) expand previous meta-analyses on identification to synthesize the literature on identification of disabilities in children who are Els; and (e) to update the Grigorenko (2005) synthesis of the LD-genetics literature."

"9386361","ABSTRACT The goal of this award is to foster the transition of the applicant to an independent investigator in the field of PET neuroimaging focusing on the development and translation of novel PET neuroimaging probes for early detection of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) to clinics. The applicant is redirecting his research focus from oncological PET imaging to PET neuroimaging. And the new direction is significantly different from the applicant?s former training, not only in pathophysiology, but also in approaches to image acquisition, and especially data analysis (image processing, kinetic modeling), characteristics of the tracers (BBB penetration, pharmacokinetics, metabolism), and animal models for translational studies. The training plan includes focused coursework, seminars and conferences, interaction with mentors from fields of PET neuroimaging probe development, tracer kinetic modeling, anti-AD drug development, and clinical AD research. Through the proposed study, the applicant will acquire new techniques, i.e., ex vivo autoradiography, image processing, and kinetic modeling. The applicant will also acquire new skills such as preparation for IND application, which is required for translating the imaging agent to the clinic. The objective of the proposed research activities is to develop an 18F-labeled PET imaging probe for early detection of AD. The proposed research project is based on pilot data obtained using [11C]UCB-J, which demonstrated both the feasibility, and clinical potential, of imaging SV2A as a biomarker for preclinical or prodromal AD. To overcome the limitations of [11C]UCB-J, an 18F-labeled analog was proposed to be developed for the clinical translation. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) To synthesize and evaluate enantiopure UCB-J analogs through in vitro homogenate binding assays; 2) To evaluate in nonhuman primates the in vivo pharmacokinetic and metabolism profiles of the [18F]UCB-J analogs advanced from Aim 1; 3) To use SV2A PET imaging to monitor the pre-dementia AD progression in a transgenic rodent model of AD through longitudinal multi-tracer PET imaging and ex vivo autoradiography. Successful completion of this project will yield a PET tracer ready to be translated to clinics for testing as a biomarker for early detection of AD."
"9342737","Summary: The histone H3 mutations found recently found in cancers have dramatic  downstream effects on the landscape of the epigenome ? chromatin state and DNA  methylation ? with eventual secondary outcomes manifested in gene expression and  cellular phenotypes. Modern functional genomics approaches provide invaluable tools to  study the effects of this epigenome-mediated cascade. In this Core activity, we will  establish a set of genomics tools and computation methods to elucidate the mechanisms  through which H3 variants impact the epigenome, transcriptome, and finally the cell  during neoplastic transformation."
"9538888","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project leverages new collaborations between biomedical and engineering investigators to develop new methods for the sorting and isolation of immune cells, where the precise trajectory of individual cells are controlled and sorted on a chip analogous to the way electrons are controlled inside computer circuits. This set of tools allows for fundamentally new methods to study phenotype, genotype, and the morphology of single or pairs of single cells, over extended periods of time with precision that is unparalleled by existing techniques, such as flow cytometry and flow cell sorting. The overall stated aims of this research are to develop the engineering platform and demonstrate a biological application for a lab-on-a-chip device that can analyze thousands of single cells over long durations, exposure to multiple stimuli, and enable the extraction of individual, high-value, cells for furthe immunological analyses (RT-PCR, clonal expansion, etc.). We aim to 1) design and fabricate a lab-on-chip assay optimized for biological applications, 2) optimize the assay for biological applications, and 3) use this novel assay to study early cellular events in the disruption of HIV latency."
"9386100","Project Summary IFGENERA Project 2 One important question in discussions around the feedback of individual genetic findings generated in the context of genomics research, relates to stakeholder expectations of and preferences for which findings are to be fed back, to and by whom, and when. A second question relates to what professionals involved in the regulation of science in Africa think about opportunities for and challenges in feeding back individual genetic research findings. In this project, we propose to conduct two studies that investigate these issues in two different stakeholder communities in Botswana and South Africa: genomics research participants and science regulators. Key questions that we will investigate relate to what people may want to know, why they want to know it, and how they would like to receive such results. Other questions relate to whether research results need to be verified in a diagnostic laboratory, and how important it is that participants who receive results, have access to the interventions that would mediate the effects of the genetic finding. Our study aims are: Aim 1: To explore expectations and preferences for feedback of individual genetic research findings with (parents of) participants involved in genomics research in Botswana and South Africa. Under this aim, we will conduct deliberative Focus Group Discussions with research participants in genomics research. This component of our study will take place in Gaborone, Botswana and Cape Town, South Africa, using three ongoing genomics research projects. In Botswana, we will involve parents of children and adolescents involved in the H3Africa CafGen project. In South Africa, we will involve parents of children and adolescents involved in genomics research on neurodevelopmental conditions, and adults involved in psychiatric genomics research on psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder). Aim 2: To explore the views on feedback of individual pertinent and incidental genetic research results with people involved in developing, implementing and applying ethical standards and policies for return of individual study results in genomics research in Botswana and South Africa. Under this aim, we will conduct in-depth interviews with people involved in developing, implementing and applying ethical standards and policies for return of individual study results in genomics research in Botswana and South Africa. Specifically, this will involve interviews with healthcare providers, researchers, medical genetics professionals and members of ethics committees involved in genomics research."
"9419231","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at later stages than non-Hispanics, due to barriers associated with knowledge, access to care, and language. Further, the American Cancer Society estimates more than half of all cancer deaths could be prevented by making healthy behavior choices (completing appropriate cancer screening tests, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, using sun protection, limiting alcohol consumption, and abstaining from tobacco). However, there is a lack of Spanish-language cancer education and prevention resources that have been culturally and contextually created for this audience. Additionally, H/L populations often tend to be viewed as one aggregate demographic group, when, in fact, there are sub-ethnicities within this population that have unique cultural and psychographic characteristics. Attending to these specific characteristics in the design and promotion of cancer prevention education may improve H/L health and represents a form of preference-based precision medicine/communication.  Results from our team?s previous work and the work of others indicate effective communication, leading to increased knowledge and behavior change can occur in multiple forms. Recent studies report community- focused, preference-based, culturally adapted programs have been successful in increasing cancer-screening behaviors in H/L. We propose to build on our foundation of community-focused educational activities established during the previous funding periods and expand our goals to: reach rural areas in Puerto Rico (PR) and areas heavily populated by PRs in Florida (FL) through tailored education and the conduct of our Salud! serie de charlas in PR (a series of interactive community meetings, previously held only in FL), and conduct the community/researcher forum El Puente (The Bridge) in FL (previously held only in PR), and expand our use of social media and new technologies for measuring impacts of our efforts. In addition, we propose using the culturally-adapted Spanish version of ?Cancer 101: A Cancer Education and Training Program for Hispanics/Latinos - Version 2? (Cancer 101) as a ?train-the-trainer? curriculum to address the identified cancer- related educational needs of H/L. This adapted curriculum serves two goals: 1) it delivers culturally-tailored cancer information to H/L community members and 2) it trains a new cadre of public health students to assist the Outreach Core (OC) in disseminating cancer information. Our activities are designed to increase awareness of cancer prevention, early detection, treatment programs, and cancer research for H/L in FL, and PR. Our efforts are bolstered by the Community Health Educator (CHE) and our Community Advisory Panels (CAPs) to strengthen and sustain community partnerships/collaborative activities with key academic, community, and regional partners at both sites, and to assist with recruitment and retention of H/Ls into partnership projects, such as the PR Biobank and the Community Participant Registry."
"9485638","Project Summary-Overall Despite the overall improvement in the health of Americans during the past three decades, significant disparities in health outcomes persist based on race and ethnicity, sex, level of education and income, and other social characteristics. There is a growing awareness in many segments of United States society that persistent health disparities are not acceptable, and that through coordinated and targeted actions most health disparities are correctable. Created in 2005 with funding as an EXPORT Center, and current funding as a NIMHD Center of Excellence (P20), the Texas Center for Health Disparities (TCHD) has been a leader in health disparities research, education, and outreach in its local community, throughout the State of Texas, and in many parts of the nation. Building on its significant experience and expansive relationships, the TCHD proposes the NIMHD Specialized Center of Excellence (COE) with a focus on Women's Health Disparities. Consistent with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) focus of the TCHD, the focus area was identified through substantial community dialogue with partners. We will employ translational and CBPR approaches for identifying developing detection and therapeutic strategies for triple negative breast cancer, testing a patient- centered, community pharmacy-based comprehensive medication therapy management for HIV patients and an intervention to improve health behavior among women in underserved communities. Our COE will augment and strengthen the existing infrastructure and capacity of the TCHD for conducting basic, clinical, translational, participatory, and socio-behavioral research consistent with the NIMHD Research Framework. Our focus on Women's Health Disparities will address a significant need among racial and ethnic minority women in the U.S., the State of Texas, and our local community. We will also expand and develop new education and community engagement activities with our partner institutions and community. The objectives of our COE are to: 1) Conduct CBPR based- and biomedical- research on health disparities in women's health that exists in Texas minorities such as cancer, HIV, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke, 2) Provide opportunities for junior faculty, postdocs and early stage investigators to train in health disparity research that meets the community needs, 3) Promote education of students in health professions, health care practitioners and policy makers on the existence of health disparities and the need to combat the problem, and 4) Serve as a resource for the minority communities in North Texas to disseminate health information, promote community participation in health education and research, and to implement disease prevention activities."
"9358912","The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laser Biomedical Research Center (LBRC) is a NIH NIBIB research resource. The LBRC is also a part of the G.R. Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory (SpecLab) administrated by the Department of Chemistry. The LBRC will enter its next funding cycle with seven senior investigators with approximately 10-15 junior staff members managing approximately 40 collaborative and service projects. Comparatively speaking, the LBRC is not a large facility; however, given that the center lies at the intersection seven senior investigator laboratories and interactions with a web of national and international collaborations with over 100 associated personnel, the LBRC is a fairly complex enterprise that needs an efficient management plan with a clear chain of responsibilities to properly function. The leadership team of the LBRC further believes that the majority of the financial resource of the LBRC should be devoted to research, collaborations, and training/dissemination. Therefore, the center's guiding management philosophy is best encapsulated by Albert Einstein's saying: ?Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.? We have been and will continue to keep a very lean budget for administration. We are able to function well with minimal administrative expenditure for two reasons: First, as a part of MIT Department of Chemistry and the School of Science, we can leverage the very well-run, larger administrative infrastructure for many LBRC operations. Second, and probably most importantly, we have a highly energetic and collaborative group of senior investigators. While all of us have research and teaching roles beyond our involvement in the LBRC, having an enthusiastic group of senior investigators who are willing to take up administrative and management roles within their busy schedule is partly the reason for success of our center so far. Given our success in the last four years, we see no reason for radical changes.  In summary, the LBRC administrative plan has five components:  (1) LBRC organization: Describe relationship of LBRC within grantee institution and delineate administrative  and operational responsibilities among senior investigators and key staff members.  (2) LBRC External Advisory Committee (EAC): Review LBRC EAC structure and membership renewal plan.  (3) LBRC operating procedures: Layout / review procedures for CP an SP management, equipment and  facility usages, and facility user training.  (4) Internal communication and networking plans: (a) Establish new TRD-wide and Center-wide regular  meetings, (b) Establish a LBRC Retreat  (5) Transition plan towards maintaining operations and service after ?sunset?."

Services available through the Resource Core include access to a direct-to-patient survey center for the capture of patient reported data, consulting services for stakeholder and patient engagement to support the development and conduct of research, and consulting services to support data analysis study conduct. In addition, the resource center supports access to a number of existing robust, ready to use research databases as well as Marketscan Claims data and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services data (CMS). These datasets provide a wide variety of robust data relevant to the NIAMS mission of musculoskeletal research including imaging data, clinical data, and patient reported outcomes. Further, the Resource Core will liaise with the Institute of Translational Health Sciences, a partnership between the University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Seattle Children's supported through the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program to ensure this resource is made known and available to potential partners. To optimize the knowledge of and access to the resources available, the Resource Core leads will collaborate with the Methodologic Core to ensure products resulting from research efforts are properly disseminated through channels that reach our core stakeholders including researchers, clinicians, healthcare administrators, and policy-makers. The Resource Core leadership, in partnership with the Administrative Core, will also develop and an Enrichment Program that includes a CCCR website for our members containing information about our investigators, on-going projects, funding opportunities (including pilot and feasibility funding), description of the research community and links to useful resources, monthly newsletters published on our website summarizing CCCR activities and highlighting the work of investigators, quarterly webinars as well as a yearly half-day symposium (Visiting Scientist Program) organized by the Methodologic Core."
"9358858","ABSTRACT The physical design features of cigarette products directly impact their appeal by influencing both cognitive and sensory perceptions. \Ventilated cigarettes dilute smoke, which promotes perceptions of ?smoothness? and therefore lower health risk, contributing to the overall appeal of these products. These perceptions and beliefs are further shaped by cigarette manufacturers' use of descriptive terms and colors on packaging designs and advertising. In this project, we will assess whether removing ventilation from cigarette filters lowers cigarette product appeal among smokers. This study thus will determine whether a regulatory requirement to reduce ventilation will lower demand for cigarettes without unintended consequences. In addition, this project will show how product appeal and risk perceptions of unventilated filters are influenced by the descriptive terms and colors used on cigarette packaging to communicate ventilation features. Using survey and laboratory methods, this project will assess the effect of variation in cigarette filter ventilation and pack messaging on consumers' rating of product appeal (especially among young adults), perceptions of specific health risks, and willingness to switch to alternative nicotine devices (ANDs). Our premise is that removal of filter ventilation will reduce the appeal of cigarette smoking and increase the likelihood that smokers would either quit smoking or switch to an alternative product (e.g., electronic cigarettes). Under Aim 1 we will assess the link between marketing proxies for filter ventilation (product descriptors, packaging) and risk beliefs using semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey of smokers using best-worst scaling (BWS) methods. Under Aim 2, we will assess the link between filter ventilation, product appeal, risk perceptions, and puffing. A core assumption of restricting the use of ventilation is that it would make smoke taste harsher and thereby reduce appeal. We will conduct a two- visit, within subjects laboratory study of smokers to determine the impact of five different levels of filter ventilation (0-80%) on smokers' product risk perceptions and ratings of sensory perception (i.e., harshness and smoothness), purchase intention, and puffing behavior. Finally, under Aim 3, we will Examine how filter ventilation, product packaging, and experience of real-world product use combine to influence appeal and risk perceptions, and willingness to quit or switch to an Alternative Nicotine Delivery (AND) product. We will conduct a multi-visit laboratory and field protocol in which various combinations of filter ventilation, product packaging, and labeling will be assessed under real-world product use experiences in terms of consumers' ratings of product appeal, risk perceptions willingness to quit, or switch to an AND."

Geisel has delegated lead responsibility  for its School-wide shared resources to NCCC Administration, which has developed an order entry and charge  entry software application (CCOPs) now used campus-wide. NCCC Administration has had lead responsibility  for budget projections, recruitment proposals, and administrative search support for the majority of all Geisel  faculty recruitments since 2008. The NCCC new and annual renewal membership processes are managed by  the Administration. Pilot project solicitations, reviews, and awards are NCCC Administration-managed.  NCCC Administration has responsibility for management of the 7-story Rubin Building. Meetings facilitated by  Administration include the monthly Program meetings, monthly Grand Rounds, annual retreat, and the annual  meeting of the External Scientific Advisory Board (EAC). Administrative funds management includes operating  accounts, philanthropic funds, and inter-departmental cancer-related external awards, including the CCSG  award and its supplements. Dedicated NCCC Senior Leadership roles include a Director, Deputy Director, and  Associate Directors for key Clinical Research, Basic Research, Population Sciences, Shared Resources,  Education, Community Affairs, and DH Cancer Service components. As a team, Senior Leadership meets  semi-monthly, addressing jointly cross-cutting considerations such as setting of priorities, identifying  translational research opportunities, recruiting new investigators, and the distribution of space and other Center  resources. Senior Leadership fosters scientific discovery through establishment of developmental funding  mechanisms, convening of scientific retreats, and formulation of an NCCC strategic plan. Focus on catchment  area needs has been advanced through Senior Leadership participation in state-wide planning, issuance of  regional emerging issue briefs, and NCCC leadership of several state-wide requested services. Senior  Leadership contributions to training initiatives have included leadership of the New Hampshire INBRE project  to develop research capabilities at currently non-research academic institutions, applying its faculty strength to  the training of additional quantitative biomedical sciences, introducing talented Dartmouth undergraduates to  cancer research, and providing graduate trainees involvement in emerging areas of interest, such as global  health."
"9386346","ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the commonest genetic disorder in the World. It is most prevalent in Africa. Penicillin prophylaxis in neonates identified by newborn screening has reduced mortality in SCD. However, this progress has not been matched by advancements in reducing deaths due to other causes. End-stage organ damage is now the leading cause of death among SCD patients in the West and it is poised to become the major cause of death in Africa once prevention and prompt management of infections becomes widely implemented on the continent. Inflammatory molecules such as heme released from hemolysis cause severe tissue injury that ultimately causes organ damage in SCD. Hemolysis raises circulating levels of free heme and cell-free hemoglobin sufficiently to cause tissue injury. Our prior studies reported in the Journal of Clinical Investigations showed that a modest elevation of circulating heme that has no impact on transgenic sickle cell trait mice causes a lethal damage to the lungs in littermates with SCD in a condition commonly called acute chest syndrome (ACS). Our preliminary studies show that excess circulating heme can also cause acute kidney injury (AKI) in transgenic sickle cell mice. Together these findings highlight proteins that can neutralize heme as potential alleviators of the organ damage seen in SCD patients who develop hyper- hemolysis. In support of this idea, we reported previously that a (GT)n dinucleotide polymorphism associated with increased activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate limiting heme degradation enzyme is linked to significantly lower rates of ACS. There are four other key hemolysis cytoprotective proteins (HCPs); hemopexin, alpha-1 microglobulin, ferritin and haptoglobin. We reason that these HCPs are modifiers of acute organ damage in SCD. Remarkably, there has not previously been a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identity the genetic factors that influence the level of the three HCPs that directly detoxify heme; HO-1, hemopexin and alpha-1 microglobin. Suggestive of a variable cyto-protective defense among SCD patients, our preliminary studies show a wide range of levels (up to 300-fold variation) for each of the five key HCPs in a cohort of SCD patients in Ghana. We will perform a GWAS to identify variants associated with the level of the five HCPs in two large cohorts SCD patients in Ghana, and replicate our findings in three large patient cohorts in Cameroon, Nigeria and Tanzania. This geographical coverage will ensure that we capture the genetics of variable HCP expression among SCD patients across the African continent. We will then longitudinally follow these cohorts to determine whether variants associated with raised HCP level protect patients from acute organ damage during vaso-occlusive crisis and hyper hemolysis. This project will provide a unique opportunity for African scientists to study genomics of SCD, including experiments using transgenic SCD mice for the first time on the continent, to help fulfill the central objective of the H3Africa consortium."
"9346560","PROJECT SUMMARY The Helium Ion Microscope has been developed over the last five years into a powerful tool for imaging a wide range of samples at sub-nanometer resolution. It offers unique features for biomedical research by virtue of its ability to image, without coatings, non-conductive specimens such as bio-tissues and nano-structures in cells at resolutions beyond those attainable by other techniques. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to develop a high efficiency detector capable of energy discrimination for the Helium Ion Microscope that will add efficient elemental mapping capability to this already powerful technique. The proposed detector, based on Direct Electron?s proven sensor technology, will overcome sensitivity, acquisition speed, flexibility, and cost limitations of current spectrometers. From the specific energy and spatial distribution of ions scattered in the microscope, it will be possible to determine both elemental structure and composition of the sample on the nanometer scale. This innovation will provide a new imaging tool to study causes of human diseases such as kidney stone formation, bone tissue degradation and regeneration, nanoparticle toxicity, blood vessel damage and aging, and eventually we expect it to lead to new drug discoveries and treatment. In the first phase of the project an existing Direct Electron CMOS sensor developed for high-energy electrons (100 keV to 1 MeV) will be modified to provide the necessary detection efficiency and energy resolution for ions. The modifications will include preparation of the sensor surface so that ions can interact and produce measurable signals. The sensor will be operated in a newly designed camera and tested at the state-of-the-art Helium Ion Microscope facility at Rutgers University. The multi-dimensional image data analysis process will also be further developed based on preliminary work done at DE and Rutgers."
"9379211","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal titled ?MicroRNA-based interventions to prevent progression from lung preneoplasia to adenocarcinoma? is responsive to PQ1. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advances in detection and improvements to standard of care, the overall survival rate for lung cancer patients remains very low (5). This poor survival rate is probably due to the relatively advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. If lung cancer could be identified and stopped at a preneoplastic stage prior to progression into advanced stage, we could improve the patients' survival. However, little is known about the biomarkers distinguishing preneoplasia from normal tissues and the molecules driving preneoplasia initiation and progression. Recent evidence has shown that intratumor cellular heterogeneity contributes to tumor initiation and progression of cancer, including lung cancer (6). Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) or cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of the bulk of tumor cells that can recapitulate the whole tumor's heterogeneous structures and functionally drive tumorigenesis. Nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) is the key mediators of the inflammation response and has been recently been implicated as a driver of TICs (7). More recently, it has been found that inflammation can change expression of some microRNAs (miRNAs), including upregulation of oncogenic miR-21 (8). MiRNAs are non-coding RNAs belonging to a novel class of regulatory molecules that control gene expression by binding to complementary sites on multiple target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts simultaneously (9). However, the signaling events that link cancer stemness-related miRNAs to preneoplasia initiation and progression in inflammatory microenvironments remain to be charted. We hypothesize that inflammation induced miRNA dysregulation on TICs might drive preneoplasia initiation and progression in KRASmut or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRmut) lung adenocarcinoma patients, and that a deeper understanding of this may identify novel targets for miRNA-based therapeutics. In Aim 1, we will characterize a miRNA signature in preneoplasia in lung tissues. In Aim 2, we will investigate roles of miRNA inhibitors or mimics in preventing progression from preneoplasia to neoplasia in lung. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have generated a new tumor organoid model, developed miRNA therapeutics useful in curing preneoplasia and preventing malignant progression, as well as gained innovative information regarding roles of both TICs and the inflammatory niche in preneoplasia initiation and progression."
"9422519","Data and Statistical Analysis Core Summary: The Data and Statistical Analysis Core (Data Core) provides two essential functions for Advancing Reliable Measurement in Alzheimer's Disease and cognitive Aging (ARMADA). The Data Core will 1) provide the data management infrastructure to permit data processing, secure housing, and sharing, and 2) serve as a central unit to direct, manage, and coordinate both psychometric and statistical analysis. The Core consists of an expert group of database managers and analysts capable of processing and analyzing diverse data types.  We will develop and operate a central data repository for data collected at participating sites using the English and Spanish versions of from the NIH Toolbox for Assessment of Neurological Behavior and Function (NIHTB) batteries (cognition, emotion, sensory, motor), and the 3 proposed new tests. The Data Core will use established National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database mechanisms, pipelines and procedures to receive, curate, store and provide the data to the analysis team and other researchers.  A key component of the Data Core is the NACC [U01 AG016976], which has been receiving data from all NIA Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) for the last 18 years. These data include a standardized longitudinal clinical evaluation, a neuropsychological test battery (UDS), and ancillary data including voluntarily submitted MRI/PET imaging (DICOM), and other biomarker data. The UDS-based clinical evaluations will be important in defining the comparison groups at six of the nine sites (e.g., older normal controls [NCO], normal controls in the oldest of old [NCOO], amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], and early AD). The NIHTB Cognitive Battery will be validated against the UDS neuropsychological battery and new measures will be added to potentially extend the NIHTB (NIHTB+) to improve early detection of clinically significant cognitive change.  To make meaning of these data, the Data Core comprises a diverse set of analysts, including statisticians, psychometricians, and neuro-imaging analysts. The ARMADA statistical analysis team draws heavily upon personnel from the ADCs and the Patient-Centered Assessment Resource (U2C CA186878), which is currently responsible for norming, scoring, and enhancing the NIHTB. The Data Core will validate and extend the NIHTB and NIHTB+ by conducting psychometric and statistical analyses to determine psychometric properties, structural validity, construct validity, and longitudinal validity of the existing NIHTB and NIHTB+ measures. Validation analyses will be conducted across clinical groups (AD, aMCI), NCO, NCOO, participants from underrepresented groups, and Spanish-speakers. The vision of the ARMADA Data Core is one in which data are efficiently and centrally merged and pre-processed, followed by the execution of clearly specified analysis plans and theory-driven hypotheses, thereby building the validity evidence for the use of the NIHTB+ in the detection and treatment of AD."
"9415538","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The complexity of the mammalian brain is unparalleled by any other organ, and understanding its cellular composition is essential to understand how it gives rise to cognition and behavior. It is clear that brain contains many more cell types than have been described to date. Many cell types can now be distinguished by their patterns of gene expression, and knowledge of these patterns can provide genetic access to specific populations of neurons. The ability to manipulate and measure activity in genetically defined cell types and circuits will allow us to move from a static anatomical description to a dynamic understanding of brain function.  Although genetic tools have dramatically advanced our understanding of brain function, they have largely been confined to mice. While mice are essential models for many areas of neuroscience, there are also many aspects of higher brain function that cannot be adequately modeled in rodents. Similarly, many brain disorders affect higher cognitive functions that have no clear parallels in rodents. There is thus an urgent need for new genetic models that are phylogenetically closer to humans.  A promising emerging primate model is the common marmoset, a small new world primate that has many advantages for neuroscience and genetic research. In the past three years, we have established a large marmoset colony and a genetic engineering platform at MIT to generate marmoset genetic models for various brain disorders. We have successfully demonstrated efficient gene knockout and knockin techniques in marmoset embryos. We have also generated and assembled high quality marmoset genome sequence. In addition, we are developing hardware and software for automated behavioral analysis as well as electrophysiological recording and multi-photon imaging approaches. Our goal is to make this a national technology and resource center for using marmosets to study brain function and dysfunction. Here propose to add another important dataset to this potentially transformative model?using single cell RNAseq to systematically define cell types, their location and morphology. These data will be critical for generating cell type-specific genetic tools as well as for monitoring and manipulating circuit activity in a cell type-specific manner, key approaches to understand brain function and dysfunction."
"9542419","H3ABioNet Project Summary H3ABioNet, a pan African bioinformatics network for H3Africa, had the enormous task of building bioinformatics capacity for genomics research against a backdrop of high disease burden, limited resources, poor internet and a large gap in bioinformatics skills in Africa. Despite these challenges, the network achieved a number of successes by building computing infrastructure and associated skills, developing and facilitating access to analysis tools, and implementing a comprehensive training programme. In the next phase, H3ABioNet will extend these activities more broadly to develop a robust and innovative informatics network that addresses the complex needs of genomics researchers from clinical and biological data collection to genomic data generation and analysis and ultimately to impactful translation health research. The network will be the H3Africa data coordinating centre, hosting the data prior to submission to public repositories and providing access to data in line with the needs and consent of PIs and participants. It will ensure that data is quality controlled, standardized and interoperable. In order to facilitate adequate exploitation of genomic data, H3ABioNet will improve the user experience with genomics tools, adapting them, where necessary, for African data. The network will also go beyond this by seeking innovative data integration and translational solutions to enable comprehensive systems level analysis of diseases to ensure African scientists not only remain internationally competitive, but lead the way in translational research with tangible benefits for patients. The informatics infrastructure will be implemented through eight work packages: 1) Health Informatics; 2) Data and standards; 3) Databases and resources; 4) Pipelines and Computing; 5) Tool Development; 6) Integration; 7) Training; and 8) Sustainability, Outreach and Development. A ninth, cross-cutting activity, will be H3Africa project and Coordinating Center support in data analysis and the use of the infrastructure developed. H3ABioNet will reach out to all members of the H3Africa consortium and beyond to ensure maximum utilization of our resources and to transfer skills across the continent. It will develop the next generation of African scientists who have multidisciplinary skills and the capacity to successfully attract research funding. Links with national and international organisations and networks will ensure that these scientists remain on the cutting edge of genomics and are well placed for future realisation of precision medicine."
"9436948","Project Summary  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a cancer that exhibits genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity along with a highly variable disease course among patients that remains poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted vast inter- and intra-patient genetic heterogeneity, with subclonal evolution commonly occurring in treatment settings leading to therapeutic resistance and relapse in many cases. In addition, our understanding of the role of co-existing non-cancer cells in the tumor-microenvironment remains limited. Therefore, characterization of these subclonal populations and their corresponding microenvironment will be paramount to enabling precision medicine and synergistic treatment combinations that target subclonal drivers and eliminate aggressive subpopulations thereby improving clinical outcome. In order to accurately dissect the genetic landscape and reconstruct the underlying subclonal architecture in CLL, measurements must be made on the single cell level.  In the F99-phase of this proposed research, Jean Fan will continue developing statistical methods and computational software to analyze single cell RNA-seq data derived from CLL patient samples. Specifically, Jean will develop methods to identify aspects of genetic heterogeneity, such as the presence of small single nucleotide mutations and regions of copy number variation, in single cells. Jean will then reconstruct the genetic subclonal architecture and characterize the gene expression profiles of identified subclonal populations.  In the K00-phase of this proposed research, Jean will characterize heterogeneity in the tumor- microenvironment and develop methods to assess potential reciprocal interactions between subclones and their microenvironment over time in response to therapy.  The proposed work will yield innovative statistical methods to enable the identification and characterization of subpopulations in cancer and yield open-source software that can be tailored and applied to diverse cancer types. Ultimately, application of these developed methods to CLL will provide a better understanding of CLL development and progression. "
"9386633","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is the Clinical and Translational Core (Core D) as part of the competitive renewal of the UT Southwestern O'Brien Kidney Research Center. The long-term objective of this Core is to facilitate translation of basic and clinical discoveries into effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve the lives of patients with kidney disease. We promote and directly facilitate bidirectional translation between basic and patient research. Since the last competitive renewal we established the Core as an outstanding resource for Core Members to conduct studies in patients with CKD including those with diabetes, hypertension and glomerular diseases. Investigators have conducted innovative, high impact cutting-edge research in diverse ethnic and racial groups to improve detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of those at very high risk for kidney disease progression and its complications. We now propose the following three specific aims: 1) develop a human kidney disease laboratory in the form of registries and biorepository to study the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic kidney diseases in the areas of polycystic kidney disease, glomerulonephritis, peritoneal dialysis, and CKD- mineral bone disorder, taking full advantage of the very large number of patients with these conditions in our practice; 2) provide expertise, technical and logistical support in study design, protocol development and implementation for conducting human clinical trials; and 3) provide educational enrichment programs for all investigators and their trainees. Core D functions in the spirit and mission of the O'Brien Center to advance our understanding of kidney development and genetics, physiology and pathophysiology, and chronic kidney disease and its complication with the eventual goal of improving diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases."
"9446220","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant factor predisposing chronic kidney disease (CKD), however the factors mediating CKD progression are not clear. Work from the previous project period identified T-helper 17 cells (Th-17) as a primary lymphocyte population activated by AKI and further demonstrated that it is strongly activated by exposure of post AKI rats to high salt diet. Recent preliminary data indicate a potential role for altered lymphocyte intracellular calcium signaling in mediating enhanced IL17 activity. The overarching hypothesis to be tested is that AKI results in persistent IL-17 activity from CD4+ cells and this activity is integral to the subsequent development of CKD. As such, Specific aim 1 of this application will investigate the role of Th-17 cells in the mediation of the AKI to CKD transition in rats. The studies will utilize a rat model of AKI-to CKD established in our laboratory. Two approaches will be used to inhibit Th17 activity. In one series of studies, we will use an antibody-based approach to block IL17 activity in rats in vivo. Additional studies will utilize a transgenic rat in which the ROR?T gene has been mutated. This rat shows impaired activation of Th-17 cells following AKI and lymphocytes obtained from these rats show an impaired IL17 responses in vitro. Using either approach we will test whether Th17 cells activated by elevated dietary salt following recovery from AKI participate in the processes of renal fibrosis, sodium sensitive hypertension, altered vascular reactivity and distant organ injury following AKI Specific aim 2 of this application will more precisely examine altered lymphocyte signaling associated with IL17. Isolated lymphocytes from normal or post AKI rats will be stimulated in vitro (by elevated Na+ and Ang II) for enhanced IL17 synthesis. The goal of these studies will be to determine how prolonged enhanced IL17 responses to are retained in CD4 cells following resolution of renal injury. We will also investigate potential physiologically relevant mediators that may activate these responses in vivo. Additional studies in this aim will investigate contribution of the store-operated Ca++ Oria1 to altered Ca signaling and the IL17 response. Finally studies in this aim will seek to investigate the effect of in vivo inhibition of Oria-1 on the activation of Th-17 cells and the AKI to CKD transition. Specific aim 3 will determine whether activation of Th17 cells may underlie the AKI to CKD transition in human patients. These studies will utilize samples available from the ASSESS-AKI consortium which has collected samples from AKI patients for up to 4 years following hospital discharge. We will compare circulating Th17 cytokines as an initial step to determine the activity of this pathway in patients with AKI who progress versus patients who recovery renal function as well as control patients."
"9422375","Project Summary This proposal supports the bioinformatics needs of two NCI funded Outstanding Investigators at the Northwestern University Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics. One project, with Dr. Ali Shilatifard, examines the role of mutations in histone modifiers such as MLL in the progression of cancer. A recent discovery on the stabilization of mutant proteins relative to wildtype gives insight into one cause of disease and a new target for cancer therapy. Another project examines the role of transcription elongation factors in cancer development. These proteins are often fused to MLL in leukemia, but it is not clear why general transcriptional regulators lead to specific types of cancer. A third project examines another chromatin protein, histone H3, and how mutation of H3K27 to methionine can lead to specific types of pediatric brain cancer. Here too, new understanding of the molecular mechanism of the disease has led to a new line of therapy for this currently incurable and devastating childhood cancer. A fourth project, in collaboration with Dr. Marcus Peter, examines another fundamental cellular process, DISE, and how it might be exploited to trigger cell death specifically in cancer cells. The common thread in all of these projects is the need for careful, biologically motivated computational analysis to make sense of next generation sequencing data that is essential in examining the function of cancer cells, both before and after perturbation. Dr. Bartom will provide this analysis, and her expertise in both biology and computation will allow cancer biologists to extract more insight from their data, and to maintain a high standard of scientific rigor and reproducibility."
"9566375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the combination of specific sensitizations and exposure to allergens have been shown to be associated with morbidity in asthma, whether there is a similar subgroup of individuals with COPD with higher risk for COPD morbidity and progression remains unclear. Preliminary studies suggest that a subgroup of individuals with COPD with atopy have worse respiratory symptoms and worse cross-sectional COPD outcomes. However, the specifics of the allergic sub-phenotype of COPD and its association with COPD progression remain to be fully understood. In this application, we plan to investigate the allergic sub-phenotype of COPD and its association with progression of COPD in a group of individuals from the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD study (COPDGene). COPDGene is an ongoing cohort study of current and former smokers which seeks to investigate the risk factors for and genetic determinants of COPD development and progression. In this proposal, we will conduct an ancillary study which seeks to define a sub-phenotype of COPD including individuals with allergic disease. [Specifically, we will study clinical allergic symptoms in the full cohort o participants of COPDGene, and then focus on the presence of specific sensitizations and markers of general allergic inflammation in 600 individuals with moderate to severe COPD and correlate these characteristics with patient-centered outcomes of COPD longitudinally. We will also determine whether these allergic disease characteristics modify the known association between smoking and COPD progression. We will validate our findings from these steps in the SPIROMICS study to lend strength and generalizability to our findings.] Finally, we will collect settled dust samples from the homes of [160] individuals with COPD to understand whether the combination of sensitization and exposure to indoor allergens is associated with worse COPD morbidity. Ultimately, the information gained from this application will contribute to understanding a sub-phenotype of COPD that is currently poorly understood. Additionally, these data will have implications for the management of COPD and future testing of environmental and allergen abatement strategies for at-risk individuals. The applicant, a physician in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine as well as Clinical Epidemiology, has demonstrated a dedication to developing a career in clinical research. Though she is early in her career, she has shown a great deal of initiative, motivation, and productivity in her ongoing research endeavors. This application is structured to allow the candidate to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator exploring the role of comorbidities in determining COPD outcomes with the goal of improving patient-oriented outcomes in COPD. In the immediate timeframe, this proposal would allow the applicant dedicated time to conduct the outlined research project, as well as pursue didactic training in immunology, [environmental health sciences], and further quantitative methods relevant to this project and future research plans. [Additionally, we hope that the data generated from this research proposal will form the basis for an R01 application seeking to study specialized interventions to improve outcomes in patients with the allergic sub-type COPD such as home allergen abatement.] The career development plan for this applicant includes a structured approach to mentoring, didactic coursework focused on a specific research goal, participation in local and national meetings and identification and regular assessment of career milestones. [Since the initial application, the candidate has been recruited to the faculty at Johns Hopkins University with protection of 80% of her time for the development of her research career. She has also expanded her list of published and ongoing projects, showing further commitment to the career of a researcher.] The research environment provided by Johns Hopkins University as well as the mentorship team described in this application will assist in Dr. Putcha's successful completion of her career and research goals. The Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Johns Hopkins University have a long history of training successful young clinical researchers in a supportive and collaborative environment. The pre-existing structure of the COPDGene and SPIROMICS studies, the parent studies for this application, as well as the applicant's established and ongoing collaboration with these groups, will ensure that the study goals will be completed within the timeframe of this award. We have assembled a mentoring team of established faculty with many years of productive research experience and substantial prior mentoring experience. Each has distinct, complementary strengths in areas of research relevant to this proposal.

"9396305","(7) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Specific Aims The current proposal aims to integrate core AUD constructs and theories, including promising endophenotypes, into an RDoC framework. This systematic integration will be used to derive a set of construct valid AUD ?diagnostic criteria? that will be validated in a college, community, and treatment sample. The resulting measure will consist of phenotypic-based criteria that are well-suited for treatment purposes, given they match directly to individual treatment targets, consistent with the precision medicine approach. Method Towards these aims, a systematic review of reviews on the topics of AUD etiology, core theories, and important endophenotypes will be conducted. Seminal, replicable findings will be integrated into the RDoC matrix (Aim 1). Once the core AUD domains have been identified, a second review will be conducted with the goal of identifying existing questionnaire and interview items that address each addiction-related RDoC domain. The appropriateness of these item/domain categorizations will be evaluated by Dr. Sher and consultants in order to provide feedback on the validity of the categorizations (Aim 2). Lastly, the items identified in Aim 2 will be used to develop a diagnostic measure of AUD using advanced statistical methods such as IRT, using the help of Drs. Merkle and Bucholz (consultants) and Dr. Sher (sponsor; Aim 3). An MTurk sample of participants (N = 1,000) will be used for the item evaluation stage of measure development, and a college student (N = 1,000), outpatient (N = 150), and treatment (N = 150) sample will be used for the clinical refinement and external validation stage. Long-Term Objectives The over-arching goal of the proposed project is to develop an objective measure of AUD that is informed by basic translational science, consistent with the RDoC framework. Through the systematic integration of seminal work on AUD etiology into an RDoC framework, which has not been previously accomplished, the current study is well-positioned to produce a construct-valid measure of AUD that can be used to inform clinical treatment decisions. The proposed project can contribute to the movement towards developing personalized AUD intervention efforts by focusing on the specific domains in which individuals are experiencing symptoms and therefore overcoming the current issues related to treatment of widely heterogeneous AUD presentation. Training Aims The current proposal will serve as an important starting place for my long-term objective of building a more reliable and construct-valid diagnostic framework for use in the assessment and treatment of AUDs. The proposal will allow the applicant to gain valuable experience in translational science and its application within an RDoC framework, plus knowledge in analysis of big data, test construction, and psychometric evaluation. The nature of these training experiences will provide me with an immersive experience through close collaboration with mentors and exposure to new research and statistical methods. Thus, successful completion of these training aims will provide the foundation for my career objective of obtaining a tenure-track research position investigating AUD nosology and assessment with the goal of using these findings to improve clinical outcomes."
"9297519","Abstract High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising, non-invasive surgery modality that has received a lot of attention in recent years. Numerical modeling of HIFU is becoming an important tool for treatment planning, designing new sonication protocols, evaluating safety and efficacy of treatments, etc. Developing reliable, validated, and efficient open-source modeling tools is important for the HIFU community as not every group has resources to develop their own codes. Two common HIFU techniques exist: they are the thermal based HIFU technique and shock wave based HIFU technique. While the first type (the more common type) uses relatively low pressure continuous wave (CW) and primarily causes thermal coagulation, the second type uses extremely high pressure shock wave pulses to cause mechanical fractionation of tissue. To this date, no open-source toolbox can efficiently and accurately model these two types of HIFU in three-dimensional (3D) large-scale, complex, heterogeneous biological tissue. In the proposed study, we shall address a longstanding need in the HIFU community for a fast and versatile open source HIFU modeling toolbox. In Aim 1, we shall create a fast, versatile, and accurate algorithm for HIFU modeling. By considering tissue heterogeneities in the Westervelt equation, a modified wave-vector-frequency- domain (M-WVFD) method for predicting linear/nonlinear wave fields in arbitrarily heterogeneous media will be systematically investigated for the first time. Out preliminary study indicates that this algorithm can be two orders of magnitude faster than the existing ones. The M-WVFD method will be numerically and experimentally validated. In Aim 2, we shall focus on software engineering, so that the developed software can be widely accepted in the HIFU community. We propose to have this software released to public at the end of the first year and will continuously upgrade the software throughout the lifetime of the project."
"9374696","ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC) ABSTRACT We propose a novel deployment focused model program of personalized interventions stimulated by our work with depressed older and middle-aged adults with unmet needs in settings rarely targeted by research. Our T2 interventions are informed by consumer input, developed together with community partners, and implemented by staff of community services so that they accelerate change in the real world. Drawing from RDoC, they are simplified based on neurobiology and assess engagement of behavioral targets. We use mobile health technology to augment behavioral assessment and to guide therapists in targeting their interventions. The AC will be the Center's hub and: 1. Utilize our experience in adminstering an NIMH Center over 20 years to integrate the concerns of consumers and community partners into innovative T2 studies; 2. Provide structures for scientific and logistic support, and training of staff; 3. Rely on our ?know-how?, record, and explicit plans for developing sustained partnerships with community agencies and learning from them; 4. Capitalize on our methodological rigor; and 5. Bring to bear our experience in research career development. Our aims are to: 1. To develop a communication and decision-making structure that promotes synergy among consumers' and community partners' concerns, scientific aims, projects, and methods initiatives in pursuing innovative, transdisciplinary, T2 research. An executive committee (EC), consisting of consumers, community partners and specialized advisors, will organize the Center's functions with input by several Work Groups. 2. To provide guidance in identifying unmet needs of older and middle aged adults with mood disorders and access to community agencies serving them. A Community Integration Committee will assist us in this aim. 3. To offer operational support to projects in order to ensure high quality of research and to promote recruitment and collaboration. An Intervention Management Team will provide consultation on intervention design and fidelity, assessment, instrument and data sharing, recruitment, and research coordination. 4. To foster research training and career development in late- and mid-life mood disorders at Cornell and offer leadership in career development nationally. This effort will be spearheaded by a committee of leaders directing funded training programs. 5. To develop metrics and monitor the Center's progress in collaboration with the Methods Core. The Center will use the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Continuous Quality Improvement approach and set explicit milestones for its projects, and the Research Methods Core initiatives. 6. Organize a pilot project program, modeled after the NIH grant solicitation, review and monitoring process that capitalizes on the Center's resources and extends its research agenda."
"9423155","SUMMARY Individuals can respond to diverse nutrients and dietary restrictions in markedly different ways. Some people easily gain weight, but others remain thin no matter what they eat. Additionally, metabolic diseases can differ dramatically among individuals in a population, for both rare single-gene Mendelian diseases and common multifactorial metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. In large part, this variability suggests that individual genetic differences greatly affect the likelihood to get sick as well as the severity of the illness for both rare and common metabolic diseases across a population. It would be extremely valuable if one could identify both rare and common variants that contribute to individual responses to diet and to the acquisition of different types of metabolic diseases. Rare variants are usually identified by linkage mapping and whole- genome sequencing using families with affected individuals. By contrast, common variants are usually identified by genome-wide association studies using large populations of people with and without a disease. We will develop personalized metabolic network models for a large set of genetic individuals of the nematode C. elegans, both representing healthy metabolic state and mimicking an inborn error of human metabolism. With our experimental system and approach we will be able to derive predictions of both rare and common variation in a variety of metabolic traits influenced by nutrition. We will extensively validate such predictions using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing."
"9374695","ALACRITY CENTER ABSTRACT The rapid increase of older persons (73% increase anticipated in US by 2020) and the diseases and disabilities complicating their care make research in this area a national priority. We focus on late- and mid-life mood disorders because they are the leading cause of disability, increase medical morbidity and mortality, cause suffering, and increase the cost of care. Pharmacotherapy addresses the needs of no more than half of these persons and most non-pharmacological therapies are complex and have limited scalability and reach. We propose to put into action a novel model of deployment-based behavioral interventions and implementation, streamlined based on neurobiology models and augmented by mobile technology. Rather than focusing exclusively on uptake and sustainability of available interventions, many of which are too complex for community use, we are working to both simplify the treatments themselves and improve their delivery. Accordingly, our model: 1) Targets groups identified by consumers, community partners, and our team. 2) Develops its interventions jointly with community partners and a transdisciplinary team and uses neurobiological concepts as a ?simplification rule? for streamlining behavioral interventions so that they can be used by community clinicians; 3) integrates mobile technology to community interventions at the assessment, the intervention, and the adherence monitoring levels; and 4) tests its interventions at community sites using community clinicians to shorten the way to uptake and sustainability. To maximize our impact, we will work both in settings in which most older and middle-aged people receive care (primary care) and in settings serving persons with special clinical (elder mistreatment) and social needs (poverty). The Center's approach is a clear departure from traditional intervention and services research and can lead to a revolutionary change in how the field thinks about T2 intervention development and deployment in the community. Our Methods Core will provide quality control for the Center's projects, serve as an incubator for innovative approaches to novel design and analytic methods that enhance the information yield of effectiveness data. It also uses big-data to aid the identification of populations in need of novel interventions, provides policy support, and integrates novel mobile technology approaches to community interventions. The Core will also evaluate the Center's productivity and impact on the field and disseminate its methodological advances. We are confident that we can meet the challenges of this work because of our 20 years of working together with stakeholders and community partners in intervention planning and implementation supported by 4 consecutive NIMH-funded Center grants, a large portfolio of independently funded studies, and a strong record of research training and career development of junior investigators."
"9446852","PROJECT SUMMARY In the U.S., enteric infections and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) cause great morbidity and consume a large portion of health-care resources. Limited knowledge of the host-microbe dynamic in intestinal health and disease is a barrier for therapies aimed at boosting immunity and reducing inflammation. There is a large un- met need for fundamental understanding of the role of the intestinal epithelium in communication with gut bac- teria. The long-term goal of this project is to uncover regulatory pathways that are engaged in vivo for the in- duction of host defense genes in the intestinal epithelium. The overall objective of the present proposal is to identify upstream mechanisms that regulate the PLC-PKD-TFEB (PLC-1/DKF-1/HLH-30 in C. elegans) path- way that we identified in the previous funding period, and downstream mechanisms by which it drives gene induction. The central hypothesis is that the cholinergic nervous system controls the PLC-1/DKF-1/HLH-30 pathway, which induces a transcription factor cascade that is important for host defense in the intestine. The rationale for the proposed research is that complete understanding of how the nervous system interacts with the entire PLC-1/DKF-1/HLH-30 pathway is essential for fundamental understanding of host defense, and that a better grasp of its workings is necessary to harness its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammation or infection. To test the central hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of the nervous system in the activation of HLH-30/TFEB, by defining neurons that detect infection, the target distal tissues, and pathogen genes necessary for detection; 2) Define the link between DKF-1/PKD and HLH- 30/TFEB, by reverse genetics, HLH-30/TFEB phosphoanalysis, and defining protein-protein interactions; and 3) Determine the role of downstream transcription factors in mediating HLH-30/TFEB function, by intestine- specific loss of function and transcriptional profiling. The expected contribution of the proposed research is to define the role of the cholinergic nervous system in controlling the PLC-PKD-TFEB pathway and its down- stream transcription factor network during infection in vivo. This contribution is significant because it will repre- sent a leap forward for understanding the molecular basis of regulation of the epithelial barrier by the nervous system, and will enable the future development of therapies that manipulate the emerging muscarinic- controlled transcriptional network. The proposed research is extremely innovative because the PLC-PKD- TFEB pathway has not been studied in any context, and thus the proposed research is extremely innovative. The research proposed here represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo, by shifting focus to a new nervous system-intestinal signaling axis that is mediated by the newly uncovered PLC-PKD-TFEB pathway. The proposed work overcomes many barriers to the comprehensive understanding of host defense, and has great potential to accelerate the development of innovative therapies that target the emerging musca- rinic-controlled transcriptional network to treat infectious or inflammatory diseases."
"9426269","The digestive function of the stomach depends on acidification of the gastric lumen. Acid secretion into the lumen is triggered by activation of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) cascade, which ultimately results in the insertion of gastric H,K-ATPases into the apical plasma membranes of parietal cells. A coupling protein is ezrin, an 80 kDa phosphoprotein, whose phosphorylation at Ser66 by PKA is required for parietal cell activation. Our early study demonstrated that H. pylori VacA perturbs parietal cell secretion and induces parietal cell loss via calpain-elicited ezrin proteolysis. Recent studies demonstrate that gastric metaplasia and hyperplasia are results of ezrin loss in the parietal cells, suggesting the importance of ezrin signaling in parietal cell homeostasis and renewal. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism(s) by which the ezrin signaling pathway operates in gastric acid secretion and responds to H. pylori infection. The long-term goal of our research is to delineate how ezrin functions in gastric parietal cell secretion and homeostasis in response to the physiological stimulation and to H. pylori infection. To address this question, three Specific Aims are proposed: first, we will evaluate how MST4 interacts with ACAP4 and ezrin using epitope-tagging and chemical footprinting approaches. These studies will involve a detailed analysis of the structural determinants that mediate a direct MST4-ACAP4 contact. Binding domain data will be used to design peptides that potently and specifically perturb MST4-ACAP4 interactions in in vitro binding assays. The function of this interaction will then be evaluated by the effects of the peptides on acid secretion using permeabilized gastric glands and by introducing MST4-interaction deficient ACAP4 mutants into cultured parietal cells from ACAP4 knock-out animals. Second, we will define the role of MST4 in regulating spatiotemporal dynamics of ARF6 GTPase during parietal cell activation. The importance of such an interaction in acid secretion in response to physiological stimulation of H. pylori infection will then be evaluated by functional assay and super-resolution imaging analysis. Third, we plan to illustrate the molecular mechanisms by which MST4-ezrin-ACAP4 signaling axis orchestrates parietal cell homeostasis in human gastric organoids in the presence of H. pylori infection. These studies will be facilitated by biochemical and functional characterization coupled with optical imaging of secretory vesicle trafficking in live parietal cells with novel ACAP4 inhibitor MSM0601.  Studying the molecular mechanisms underlying parietal cell secretion and homeostasis is of great significance in understanding the cellular physiology of regulated epithelial secretion in the gut, and is also expected to be of great benefit in leading to development of pharmacological strategies for correction and/or prevention of H. pylori infection-elicited gastric atrophy."
"9329112","Project summary Alcohol is linked to approximately half of all violent crimes committed in the United States. Severe social and financial ramifications of these acts of violence include chronic health issues, pain and suffering, property damages, repeated arrests, incarceration, and fatalities; financially, the consequences of alcohol-associated violence will cost the US more than $200 billion this year alone. Advancing our understanding of the biological basis for violent outbursts may guide the development of clinical tools for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of alcohol-associated aggression. According to a frequently cited, yet presently untested hypothesis, alcohol may disrupt medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) top-down control over subcortical, aggression-promoting brain regions. On a cellular level, alcohol may hinder excitatory inputs onto inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC; reduced GABAergic transmission may subsequently disinhibit excitatory corticolimbic projections. To address this hypothesis, chemogenetic or optogenetic tools will be used to target GABAergic interneurons in the mPFC of male mice; analyses of intruder-directed murine aggression will clarify whether reducing inhibitory interneuron activity in the mPFC is sufficient to escalate aggression. Wild- type (wt) and mutant male mice with Cre recombinase (Cre) specifically expressed in fast-spiking parvalbumin- positive interneurons (PV-Cre mice) will be microinfused with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to drive Cre- dependent expression of inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the mPFC. After viral infection, PV-Cre mice will be characterized as alcohol-heightened (AHA) or alcohol non- heightened aggressors (ANA) and tested for escalated aggression toward a submissive conspecific upon inhibition of PV+ interneurons with doses of clozapine-N-oxide. The second aim addresses the role of alcohol in the disinhibition of aggression; associated experimental work will test whether alcohol-heightened aggression can be blocked via activation of inhibitory PV+ interneurons in the mPFC. PV-Cre mice and wt controls will be microinfused into the mPFC with an AAV driving Cre-dependent expression of stable stepwise function opsins (SSFOs) in PV+ interneurons. To assess the effects of PVI activation on alcohol- heightened aggression, characterized mice will receive a pulse of blue light for stable depolarization of PVIs via activated SSFOs prior to receiving water or a pro-aggressive dose of alcohol. In sum, experiments guided by aims one and two will test the following hypotheses: 1.) Inhibition of PV+ interneurons in the mPFC is sufficient to escalate aggression and, 2.) Reduced activity by mPFC inhibitory interneurons is required for expression of alcohol-heightened aggression. This work will provide novel insight into the involvement of mPFC microcircuitry in alcohol-heightened aggression and will encourage further investigation into the neurochemical and genetic bases for alcohol-related violence in humans."
"9351522","The overarching goal of Project 2 within this multidisciplinary POI Program Project is the development of HIV- 1 entry inhibitors that target the Env spike before the virus encounters the host cell by employing peptide and protein science strategies to design viral entry antagonists. In addition, the derived peptide antagonists, as well as the peptidomimetics emerging from the parent peptides, will be utilized as mechanistic probes to define the vulnerabilities ofthe HlV-1 Env complex to deactivation. Recently, we have discovered a family of peptide triazoles that target a conserved footprint, on gp 120, which overlaps significantly with the CD4 binding site. These inhibitors bind gp120 with nanomolar affinity and block interactions at the sites responsible for binding with both of the cellular receptors required for viral entry. A combination of sequence minimization, non-natural amino acid substitutions, nuclear magnetic resonance and computational simulations have revealed a core pharmacophore in the peptide triazoles that consists of three amino acid residues. Biophysical and functional studies suggest that the inhibitors stabilize a partially structured state of gp 120 and, through an allosteric mechanism, disrupt the conformational transitions of Env complex required to mediate viral entry. In addition, we recently discovered that peptide triazoles, likely by conformational effects, cause gp 120 shedding in the absence of host cells and consequent irreversible inactivation of virus. Further, and of considerable interest, peptide triazole variants containing a free sulfiiydryl group disrupt the structural integrity of HIV-1 envelope membrane, leading to leakage of the intra-viral capsid protein p24. Going forward, these results will be employed to design and validate peptidomimetic and small molecule Env antagonists that inactivate virus. To achieve the overall goals of this Program Project, three Specific Aims will be pursued by Project 2: [1] design, synthesize and develop structure-simplified peptide and peptidomimetic antagonists of HIV-1 envelope and host cell receptor interactions; [2] map the gpl20 binding site for the peptide and peptidomimetic antagonists that define the conformational transitions of gp 120 triggered by peptide triazoles; and [3] determine the mechanistic effects of peptide triazole and peptidomimetic inhibitors on Env protein and virus particle structure and function, and from this understanding, delineate vulnerabilities of the virus Env to antagonism and inactivation. The peptide-based antagonists developed by Project 2 will contribute substantially to the overall effort of this Program Project to understand structural mechanisms of the Env protein entry machine, which in turn holds the promise of providing new tactics for both AIDS prevention and intervention."
"9369811","Abstract How do the cell fates, lineages, and molecular histories of individual cells control the development and physiological function of tissues? This problem is of central importance throughout biomedical science. However, progress has long been limited by two seemingly intractable, and inter-related, challenges: First, we still have no method to determine the tree of lineage relationships among cells in developing tissues within their native spatial context. Second, we have no way to determine the sequence of extracellular signals and intracellular molecular events experienced by each cell in the developing tissue as it differentiates. Time-lapse imaging has been the principal go-to method to image biological processes in living systems. However, a large number of systems in biology and medicine do not permit live cell imaging methods because they are inaccessible or optically opaque, such as mouse brains and embryos. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop powerful new methods that can achieve inference of lineage information and cellular event histories from static end-point measurements. Here we propose to develop a platform that enables cells to record lineage and dynamic gene expression histories in their own genomes, within complex developing tissues. This platform will combine two recently developed tools: first, genome editing tools that can ?record? lineage information or cellular events into the genome, and second, a single molecule microscopy based in situ technology called sequential multiplexed Fluorescence In situ Hybridization (seqFISH) that can read out the recorded information in single cells without dissecting them out from tissues. We call this method MEMOIR (Memory through Enhanced Mutagenesis with Optical In situ Readout). Akin to using sequence variation for phylogenetic tree analysis, this method will allow us to reconstruct the lineage tree for a population of cells as well as the signaling event history within those cells based on the hierarchy of mutations incorporated into the target region. We have performed the proof-of-principle experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and will extend the work to mouse embryos. We envision that MEMOIR will allow us to map lineages and signaling events directly in complex tissues such as the brain and track cells in metastatic tumors."
"9444176","Elucidating the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal of neuroscience. Progress towards this goal is complicated by the fact that most behaviors arise from interactions between a number of distributed and intercon- nected brain regions. Project 4 uses models that are tightly linked to experimental data to address this issue in the context of sequential motor behaviors. Many complex motor behaviors can be decomposed into sequences of stereotyped components or `motifs' that can be rearranged to produce a wide variety of other behaviors. To create a sequence from existing motifs, the motor system must generate the required neural activity while monitoring movement progress in order to time transitions between different motifs appropriately. This modeling project is aimed at developing and testing a model of interacting networks representing motor cortex, motor thalamus and input and output structures of the basal ganglia (i.e., striatum and GPi/SNr) that can autonomously generate a wide variety of motifs, string them together ?exibly into sequences, and monitor ongoing activity to assure that transitions between motifs occur when they should. In this model, the loop between cortex and thalamus creates a single cortico-thalamic network for the execution of multiple behavioral motifs. Critically, this cortico-thalamic network is not a ?xed entity but can be modi?ed by the inhibitory output of the basal ganglia. The motif that the cortico-thalamic network produces at any given time is determined by which set of neurons in the motor thalamus is not being inhibited by GPi/SNr activity at that time. Different motifs will be selected by changing the pattern of activity in the GPi/SNr, thereby modifying the pattern of inhibition in the motor thalamus. Thus, the role of the GPi/SNr in the model is to maintain the current motif and to drive transitions to the next motif in a sequence. Models of the GPi/SNr will be used to study and propose mechanisms by which they sustain activity during a motif and switch it between motifs. Striatum will be modeled as a monitor of cortical activity with the role of deter- mining when one motif has ended and the next can begin. When an appropriate opportunity has been identi?ed, transient activity in the striatum will trigger the system to switch from one motif to another through its projections to the GPi/SNr. This modeling project is tightly matched to the overall goal of this group proposal, a detailed, quantitative understanding of the production of behavior by the motor system. Because the model relates the activities of neural populations in multiple regions (motor cortex, motor thalamus, GPi/SNr and striatum), it will provide many predictions that will be tested using the experimental data produced by the other projects within this group proposal. The results of these tests will be used to re?ne the model and, in addition, predictions of the model will guide new experimental approaches. The cycle of deriving constraints from experiments and predictions from models will continue until we arrive at an illuminating and biologically plausible circuit-level de- scription that accounts for what we observe in experiments and lends new insight into how ?exible sequential motor sequences are generated."
"9561330","Detecting melanoma early leads to a nearly 100% cure rate, but diagnosing it at an advanced stage results in less than 20% survival. The power of early diagnosis has made it the major approach to preventing death from melanoma. Yet there is little evidence that large public skin cancer screenings prevent melanoma deaths. Focusing on people at greatest risk would be possible with an early predictor of risk that helps the primary care physician identify patients who should be followed by a dermatologist. This preventive test needs to measure both aspects of melanoma risk: genetic risk and sun-exposure risk. Project 1 focuses on sun-exposure risk because most people with Fitzpatrick Type I skin do not get melanoma. Yet UV exposure is usually ascertained by patient recollections rather than by objective biological indicators of past sun exposure. To overcome this critical barrier to assessing personal UV exposure and thus melanoma risk, we propose to couple two new technologies with Next-Gen sequencing to create genomic surrogate biomarkers of long-term sun exposure. One dosimeter takes advantage of the accumulation of DNA photoproducts in special regions of the genome; the other incorporates our knowledge about clonal expansion of cells in skin. We then evaluate these genomic dosimeter readings in skin for association with melanoma. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Map human genomic regions that are UV damage hotspots or DNA repair slowspots. Aim 2: Quantitate rare UV-mutated genes in skin in vivo. Aim 3: Use genomic regions sensitive to UV photoproducts and mutations as dosimeters to correlate cumulative sunlight exposure in normal skin to risk for melanoma. These studies establish ways to objectively ascertain exposure to cancer risk using modern measurement technologies."
"9565739","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral nerve injuries represent a major public health problem, seen frequently in patients admitted to level I trauma centers and in as many as 30% of individuals with traumatic brain injuries. A primary goal of intervention in this arena is t hasten recovery so as to restore function as rapidly as possible. Progress towards this goal, however, has been limited. Interestingly, we recently discovered that systemic erythropoietin (EPO) administration speeds functional recovery after experimental crush injury to the sciatic nerve, even when EPO is administered one week after injury. These findings have already led to clinical studies being initiated overseas. Understanding how EPO induces this beneficial effect would enable us to design conditions and dosing strategies that can optimize its therapeutic effects; this is the goal of th3e studies proposed in this application. In the first Specific Aim, we will address the question of whether local delivery of EPO, rather than systemic delivery, will enable us to further enhance recovery and thus set the stage for the development of innovative local delivery methods to enhance/induce repair. The pleiotropic multi-organ effects of EPO, coupled with the surgical and medical focus for local treatment for local traumatic injury argues for a local application of this potent pharmacologic bio-modulator. This, in effect, focuses the effect of EPO directly at the site of injury, eliminating secondary effects and enabling the optimization of treatment in a clinically relevant and targeted manner. In the second Specific Aim, we will test the hypothesis that at least part of the mechanism of EPO action derives from beneficial effects on Schwann cells, the cells that support the function of peripheral nerves by myelinating the axons that run through these nerves. Overall, the identification of target cell(s) of EPO action will better enable us to determine how benefit occurs. In this Specific Aim, we will also begin teasing apart the underlying signaling that supports the impact of EPO, providing a basis for envisioning adjuvant therapies that focus on manipulating the key signaling players in the EPO receptor pathway. The above Specific Aims will represent the research training component of the proposed program to support the transition of Dr. John Elfar MD, a clinician/surgeon who is expanding his academic role to the clinician scientist track. The proposed research training plan is positioned on the backdrop of a robust mentoring and didactic training program that collectively represents a multi- faceted training environment aimed at ensuring successful career transition for Dr. Elfar."
"9535538","VISUALIZATION OF HIV-1 INTEGRATION IN REAL-TIME PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Retroviral infections, including HIV and HTLV, continue to be a pandemic problem. While several drug therapies are able to treat HIV-1 infection, the virus's propensity to develop resistance mutations remains challenging. A clear priority for the HIV-1 treatment arsenal is to identifying novel drug targets. Stable integration of a retroviral donor cDNA into the host chromosome is absolutely required for a productive infection. Nearly three decades of research have established that retroviral integration is extremely inefficient in vivo and in vitro. Integration is catalyzed by the retrovirus encoded integrase (IN), which in many retroviruses forms a tetramer complex with the two viral cDNA long terminal repeat (LTR) ends (termed an intasome). The IN protein removes two 3' nucleotides and catalyzes end joining (strand transfer) of the resulting recessed 3' hydroxyls across one major groove of the target DNA separated by 4-6 bp. HIV-1 integration requires a host protein co-factor PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 for stable intasome assembly and to target integration to chromatin marked with the histone H3(K36) trimethylation post-translational modification (PTM). Remarkably, the prototype foamy virus (PFV) remains the only complete intasome structure. While anti- retroviral drugs that target the HIV-1 enzyme integrase also inhibit the PFV integrase, it remains unclear whether the integration mechanics of these respective retroviral intasomes are similar. We have used novel single molecule analytical tools to demonstrate that the PFV intasome catalyzes the two strand transfer events during integration in quick succession. We also visualized PFV intasomes on a linear target DNA and determined that the vast majority of IN-mediated search events were nonproductive. Together these observations suggested that target site selection limits PFV integration. We propose to extend our single molecule analysis to the biophysical mechanism of HIV-1 integration. Our preliminary studies have already identified significant differences between PFV and HIV-1, suggesting that the biophysical analysis of HIV-1 is likely to be more relevant to human health. Several important questions will be addressed in this new grant application: 1.) What are the protein dynamics of HIV-1 IN during the DNA target search and integration? 2.) What are the viral DNA dynamics during the DNA target search and integration process? 3.) What constitutes an efficient DNA target site? 4.) What factors influence the DNA target search process? 5.) What are the dynamics of intasome targeting on chromatin? We propose to utilize several innovative single molecule imaging systems to visualize HIV-1 integration in real- time. We will examine DNA lesions and mechanically altered DNA structures that may mimic the preferred target DNA configuration as well as chromatin containing histones with specific PTMs. These studies are designed to fully interrogate the animated processes associated with HIV-1 integration."

In addition, the Simmons Cancer Center has created dynamic educational and training opportunities designed to equip a new generation of scientists, physicians, and other health care providers to make a difference in cancer discovery, clinical care, and control.        The Simmons Cancer Center integrates cancer research, clinical cancer care, and cancer control outreach across the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and its affiliated hospital systems. The overriding mission of the center is to leverage these affiliations and the exceptional resources available to improve cancer outcomes in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) region and the nation."
"9444125"," Project Summary: Core 1, Administration  The Administrative Core will support the Team Director and the Internal Advisory Committee of this multi-component research project as they supervise budgets and scienti??c activities to enable the project to achieve its goal of determining how the brain produces working memory and decisions. The investigators in this proposal have a strong history of collaboration over the past three years. The research projects that they have developed are tightly integrated around shared conceptual questions and a closely related set of behavioral tasks. To ensure that the project continues as a well-coordinated collaboration, the team will hold monthly meetings that include all research personnel and weekly meetings of all project leaders to review results and plan upcoming experiments. Six of the project leaders are based at Princeton University and are part of a cohesive academic community that regularly interacts in scheduled meetings and spontaneous discussions. The seventh project leader (located at the University of California, Davis) participates in weekly team meetings via video link and will travel to Princeton as needed for formal meetings. The full team is already sharing documents, drafts, ??gures, talks, and posters and conducting frequent informal discussions on one dedicated Slack channel that is used by all research personnel and another channel for PIs only. The team will hold one formal meeting per year of all personnel. The Annual Meeting will include the project leaders, students, and postdocs, along with an External Advisory Board, to be appointed by the Team Director. The purpose of this meeting will be to document and evaluate the previous year?s progress. The administrator will coordinate the Annual Meeting and produce a monthly budget report for the Team Director to review. The administrator will also assist all investigators in scheduling interviews for job candidates, meeting reporting requirements, booking travel, and acquiring major supplies and equipment. Results from the proposed research will be disseminated through formal and informal mechanisms, and the administrator will assist in these e?orts whenever possible. In addition, the Administrative Core will assist the Data Science Core in managing the dissemination and ongoing support of the prototype data science framework for the use of other researchers. The administrator will also design and implement public outreach activities. By managing these resources and activities, the Administrative Core will help the Team Director to coordinate the ??ve Projects and the four Cores, while allowing the project leaders and other research personnel to concentrate on their strengths in research by spending less time and energy on administrative tasks."
"9561235","Project Summary/Abstract: Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI)  The overall goal of the Immunology and Cancer Immunotherapy (ICI) Program is to unite the efforts of basic  and clinical immunologists to explore the immune system's impact on cancer development and progression, to  develop novel strategies that use immunity to treat cancer, and to conduct clinical trials to test novel  therapeutics and approaches to improve patient outcomes and increase overall survival. There are twenty-one  members from six different academic departments and two professional schools. The current focus and  initiatives of the ICI scientists are centered on three themes: Immune regulation, Immune effector  mechanisms, and Translational immunotherapy. The immunotherapy approaches are focused on adoptive  T cell therapy, vaccination, and immune regulation blockade. While basic research is a key focus, many faculty  members actively are involved in translational bench-to-bedside research. Other members are clinicians  (hematologists, oncologists or oncologic surgeons) who actively are involved in clinical research and clinical  trials. This program joins established and experienced clinical trialists with NCI-funded cancer immunologists to  design, execute, and complete Dartmouth-initiated immunotherapy trials in renal cell carcinoma, melanoma,  glioblastoma, colorectal carcinoma, multiple myeloma and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. There are  extensive collaborations between ICI members around common areas of interest in immunobiology and  immunotherapy, as evidenced by joint publications and funded grants. Major contributions of the program to  the mission of the NCCC have been the facilitation of new insights into the tumor microenvironment and how  this is affected by leukocytes, the development of novel protein and cell therapies, the translation of Dartmouth  investigator ideas into clinical trials, and the accrual of patients to these trials. NCCC has made substantial  commitment to improving the depth and breadth of research and clinical translation of the ICI program through  support of shared resources, financial awards for new pilot grants, and strategic recruitment of new  investigators. More than 280 cancer-related articles have been published over the reporting period, with 46  (16%) appearing in high impact journals. Intra-programmatic publications (43=15%) involved 19 of our 22  members, and inter-programmatic publications (66=24%) involved 15 members. Total grant funding for the  program currently is $6.4M, of which $5.5M is peer-reviewed and $2.2M is from NCI."
"9454915","7. Project Summary/Abstract The implementation of patient-reported outcome (PRO) models to evaluate treatment response has intensified across all domains of healthcare with the advent of new payment models that pay physicians and hospitals on the basis of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. The field of brain injury rehabilitation is no exception, with researchers and clinicians in the field of cognitive rehabilitation working to embrace patient PRO assessment models. Cognitive rehabilitation, however, poses some unique challenges to the implementation of PRO. Scales must map the cognitive domain being evaluated to a functional change and capture the importance of that change to the individual. Further complicating the goal to develop ecologically valid and sensitive PROs are the reporting barriers produced by common cognitive deficits in self-awareness and memory that can undermine the validity of self-reporting. The proposed project builds on our existing work to develop patient-centered outcome measures that objectively capture potential changes produced by cognitive rehabilitation by integrating goal attainment scaling (GAS) and motivational interviewing. Supported by a previous research grant, we developed an app, electronic goal attainment scaling (eGAS), that produces levels of progress that are measurable, attainable, and equidistant for client-selected goals that are directly related to the cognitive intervention. A pilot trial with 26 practicing medical speech language pathologists across the United States indicated that the eGAs app successfully facilitated collaborative goal setting and the construction of valid goal hierarchies. However, the feasibility of using eGAS within the time constraints and mandated assessment and paperwork policies in medical practice settings was low. The pilot users also identified additional app components that would increase usability and usefulness in practice settings. The central aim of this R03 proposal is to update the eGAS app such that it would be implemented in the private sector to produce valid, patient-generated goal attainment scales. Initially, the software engineer will design and program the priority features identified in the pilot that include additional content to make the app usable in inpatient and outpatient settings. This will be followed by feasibility trials conducted at two premier brain injury centers. The feasibility trials will be conducted in two 4-month blocks separated by an interim 4-month development block during which the app will be updated and any identified bugs will be fixed to turn the app around for a second round of feasibility testing. Evaluating methods to import eGAS reports into electronic medical records at our feasibility sites will occur during the feasibility trials. The project would enable the development of a clinically feasible eGAS tool that could be evaluated in larger trials. It would also contribute to the knowledge base about implementation factors relevant to participant-centered outcomes in brain injury rehabilitation."

"9352336","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and T3cDM remain two of the greatest challenges and unmet needs in modern gastroenterology. The focus of this U01 application from The Ohio State University is to form a strategic alliance among academic institutions in the United States. Our major goals are to address the research objectives and aims of the Consortium, and to be considered as a clinical center. Specifically, we a) describe The Ohio State University Pancreatic Disorders Network (OSU-PDN), b) propose two research studies for consideration by the Consortium and c) outline our clinical and translational research infrastructure. Several key experimental observations from our group in CP and T3cDM warrant confirmation [OSU- PDN] and validation [CSCPDPC-CCs] : 1) Proteomic analysis of pancreas fluid (PF) and urine (U) in CP subjects revealed statistically significant fold-changes in several pancreatic fluid proteins - SERPINA5, ANXA5, CST3 (candidate pancreatic fluid markers) and urine proteins - CPN2, A1AG1, AMYP (candidate urine markers) when compared to healthy controls and 2) A significant difference in serum pancreatic polypeptide response to a mixed meal was observed that may distinguish T3cDM from the much more prevalent T2DM. These preliminary observations are the focus of our research proposals for consideration by the Consortium Steering Committee. Our Clinical Center will be centrally coordinated by the Ohio State University Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS/CTSA) in collaboration with other CTSAs from our network partners in the OSU-PDN and the Consortium. The CCTS/CTSA provides consulting services and access to clinical and translational research infrastructure. This unique resource will assist our team in communicating with the CDMC, DSMB and NIDDK central repository. Both research proposals from our network address gaps in knowledge and understanding of chronic pancreatitis, diabetes and pancreas cancer as outlined by the NIDDK- National Commission on Digestive Diseases, and are strategically aligned with the objectives of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Centers (CSCPDPC-CCs) (U01)."
"9566387","A well-recognized gap exists in the path from biomedical discovery in academia to clinical application and  commercialization of therapeutic, device, and diagnostic technologies in cardiovascular, pulmonary,  hematologic, and sleep disorders. This chasm is the result of inadequate funding for support of proof-of-concept  or validation studies essential for early stage development; insufficient access to the resources and  expertise needed to develop new technologies; and a lack of knowledge and experience among academic  investigators in bringing new ideas to commercial realization. Within the partnering institutions included in  this application, the essential elements exist with which to build the infrastructure needed to support and  sustain the uninterrupted, durable flow of inventions from discovery through development and  commercialization. While these institutions have a clear track record of remarkably successful development  of many biomedical technologies, most of these commercial successes have been achieved by the tenacity  of individual inventors rather than with the help of committed institutional mechanisms. We proposed to  address these key shortcomings by establishing the regional Boston Center for Accelerated Innovation in  Therapeutics, Devices, and Diagnostics for Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders (B-BIC, or the Boston  Biomedical Innovation Center). The key objectives of this Center are to: 1) develop an integrated  infrastructure that would expand the universe of commercializable technologies for heart, lung, blood, and  sleep disorders; 2) place these opportunities in the proper evaluative context through an engagement (seed  it), solicitation (find it), and selection (pick it) strategy; 3) efficiently and effectively bring those selected to  an appropriate exit point from the development process; and 4) provide the educational and mentoring  infrastructure necessary for the development of the proper entrepreneurial skills among academic  innovators. By achieving these goals, B-BlC would change the culture of our academic environment, as  well as the relationship between the public and private sectors in facilitating successful development  strategies for technologies in heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders for the ultimate benefit of patients and society."

"9304913","Project Summary. Most proteins are symmetric oligomeric complexes. Despite their prevalence and biomedical importance, such complexes are vastly underrepresented in the PDB, and determining their structures presents daunting challenges for NMR structural biologists. In particular, simulated annealing (SA), a widely-used technique for structure determination of homo-oligomers, is vulnerable to significant structural errors. Due to assignment ambiguity, SA converges to local minima rather than to the optimal structure or structural ensemble indicated by the data. Fold Operator Theory overcomes these errors, using a systematic search algorithm shown to identify biologically important assignments and structures that SA does not find. For example, the published NMR and crystal structures of the enzyme Diacylglycerol Kinase (DAGK) have very different topologies. Our systematic search techniques not only showed that both published folds are supported by the NMR data, but also found a novel fold that satisfies the data better than either published fold.  We propose to develop novel algorithms and software enabling global and systematic search for NMR structure determination, building on our preliminary results showing that our methods can solve problems where traditional stochastic NMR methods struggle. These new tools will dramatically increase the accuracy of NMR structure determination with assignment ambiguity, which unavoidably arises for higher-order symmetric homo-oligomers. The proposed Deep Topological Sampling (DTS) has two primary modules: Fold Operator Theory (FOT); and DISCO (which we recently used to solve the structure of a membrane-associated MPER homo-trimer designed to probe immunogenic responses to the HIV-1 viral coat protein gp41).  Aim 1: We will implement a general FOT in software, to compute all the protein folds consistent with the NMR data. FOT will search globally over folds, and avoid being trapped in local minima, to find all satisfying structures. Aim 2: We will develop our DISCO algorithm to search within each viable fold generated by FOT to find all feasible low-energy structures. DISCO and FOT will exploit novel geometric and topological algorithms to perform automated assignments accurately and efficiently, thus alleviating the most time-consuming and potentially error-prone step in multimeric structure determination. Aim 3: We will apply our FOT/DTS software (developed in Aims 1-2) prospectively to important systems. (A) We will perform experiments to determine the true functional structure DAGK adopts in its native environment. (B) We will use our methods to determine the structure of a larger HIV-1 membrane-associated pre-fusion gp41 trimer construct exposing transient, intermediate epitopes that bind broadly neutralizing antibodies, but are structurally invisible in larger laboratory constructs. (C) We will solve the hemifusion intermediate structures of the antigenic, symmetric homo- oligomeric domains of the Zika virus envelope protein, an emerging global health threat. Our novel open- source software can be applied to a vast array of symmetric protein targets in viral and bacterial pathogens."
"9217905","Project Summary The Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR) is a key and widely-used indicator of child health, but it conceals important information about how this mortality is distributed by age. For better understanding and monitoring of child health, it is critical to examine how the risk of death varies within the 0-5 age range. This includes age breakdowns beyond the standard cut-off points of 28 days (for neonatal mortality) and 1 year (for infant mortality). In many populations, however, the age pattern of under-5 mortality is not well known. Less- developed countries, in particular, lack the high-quality detailed vital registration information necessary for the analysis of such age patterns. Sample surveys collecting retrospective birth histories do not satisfactorily fill this gap, because they are subject to systematic biases that are particularly consequential for estimating age patterns. This makes the need for high-quality information on age patterns of under-5 mortality even more critical, because regularities in these age patterns can be used as a powerful tool for evaluating and correcting data when sources are deficient. The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of age patterns of under-5 mortality by gathering the largest database to date on high-quality global mortality information by detailed age (by days, weeks, months, and years of age) from birth until age 5, by sex. This database, which will cover a wide array of historical and contemporary contexts in both more- and less-developed settings, will serve as a basis for generating models summarizing regularities about how under-5 mortality is distributed by detailed age in human populations. These models will then be used for evaluating and correcting under-5 mortality information by detailed age in less-developed countries. This global database, and models derived from it, will also allow us to address specific substantive questions about how and why age patterns of under-5 mortality vary by sex, time, and place, with important programmatic implications. This database will be made publicly-available, allowing the research community to easily access high-quality primary information on under-5 mortality by detailed age for their own research needs, and for further validation and replication of the project's results."

"9382777","Neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by highly heterogeneous and frequently overlapping clinical phenotypes. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of these clinical symptoms has been a central goal in neuropsychiatric research and has been largely facilitated by MRI and associated analytical methods that have found reproducible neuroanatomical abnormalities. However, the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in these disorders is also high. Therefore, attempting to find a unique neuroanatomical signature of a complex neuropsychiatric disorder using commonly used current techniques is hampered by such heterogeneity. Personalized disease treatment calls for fine quantification of heterogeneity and for more precise placement of each individual patient into a multi-dimensional spectrum of neuroanatomical alterations found in neuropsychiatric disorders. In the proposed project we focus on the neuroanatomy of psychosis. To this end, we leverage a unique set of pooled cohorts from 10 sites, including (1) adults with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum (non-affective) psychotic disorders (n=749), (2) individuals with first-episode (FE) psychosis (n=665), and matched healthy controls (N=1,483). This large cohort will allow us to test our first hypothesis, namely that neuroanatomical phenotypes of these patients will display high heterogeneity, which will allow us to define neuroanatomical dimensions of pathology. Our second hypothesis is that this heterogeneity will relate to clinical phenotypes in chronic schizophrenia spectrum patients, as well as to longitudinal outcome in FE psychosis. We leverage newly developed pattern analysis and semi-supervised machine learning techniques designed to quantify heterogeneity of complex patterns of neuroanatomical abnormalities. Our goal is to arrive at a new ?NeuroAnatomical Coordinate system of PSychosis?(NAC-PS), with each dimension reflecting a different neuroanatomical pattern of brain alterations in this spectrum, which will allow us to measure patient positions and trajectories in this spectrum, as they evolve across time and treatment. We propose to: Aim1: Develop inter-site harmonization methods for imaging data, and hence establish a methodological platform for constructive integration of structural imaging data from multiple sites. Using these methods, we will generate a resource of 2,897 datasets with advanced neuroanatomical measurements; Aim 2: investigate the heterogeneity of anatomical patterns related to psychosis at the population level, using novel group analysis methods which model the neuroanatomical phenotype of disease as a collection of directions of deviation from normal anatomy. This will define a spectrum of neuroanatomical patterns of psychosis, rather than seeking a single dominant pattern; Aim 3: Develop MRI- based classification, subtyping, and outcome prediction on an individual patient basis, under this heterogeneity; Aim 4: Relate baseline neuroanatomical patterns to longitudinal clinical outcome in FE patients, and build individualized prognostic predictors. Additional/ancillary site-specific projects that link detailed, site-specific clinical data to NAC-PS axes will be further facilitated in the future by our foundational project."
"9254952","Abstract Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a poorly treated, inherited, debilitating condition for which Vanguard Therapeutics, Inc. is developing a promising new long-term oral therapy. A dire need exists for our drug, as the millions of SCD patients worldwide and ~89,000 in the US continue to suffer with recurring pain episodes, disability, and premature death. Current treatments have well-defined limitations, and many drugs under development target resolution rather than prevention of acute events. Most clinical events of SCD are driven by abnormal blood flow. Strikingly, acute pain crises are caused by stoppage of blood flow in small vessels. While the traditional paradigm of deoxygenation-induced sickle hemoglobin polymerization and red cell sickling is necessary for sickle cell anemia, it is not sufficient to explain the impaired blood flow that drives the disease. Several mechanisms that impair blood flow are unrelated to polymerization; the frequency of acute painful vaso- occlusive episodes does not correlate with the number of red blood cells (RBC) that are most disposed to sickling but rather with the number of RBC that are least sickling prone, which are also the stickiest. Because sickle RBC sticking to P-selectin on the cells that line blood vessels is fundamental both to the continuous impairment and the sudden stoppage of blood flow, we are targeting P-selectin with our therapy. In vitro, in vivo, and preliminary clinical data show that the P-selectin blocking compound pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) improves microvascular blood flow in SCD. However, commercially available PPS is not ideal SCD therapy because of its marginal oral bioavailability and limited duration of action. A US patent application has been filed for an improved second-generation PPS component (VTI-1968) that has greater homogeneity, P- selectin blocking activity, and oral bioavailability than PPS. Funding this Phase-II SBIR proposal will support IND-enabling activities for our VTI-1968 drug product including validating P-selectin blocking activity in vivo in a mouse SCD model; designing and formulating dosage forms that increase absorption and prolong activity; optimizing bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics; and conducting pilot tox studies in experimental animals. This work will advance our compound toward production of good manufacturing practices (GMP) dosage forms for use as an optimized GMP drug substance in projected human trials, foster readiness for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA, and facilitate preparation for clinical trials. These IND-enabling activities will further the company's ability to gain funding and partners for product commercialization. Vanguard's overarching goal to be supported by this Phase-II SBIR is to improve the quality of life of SCD patients by bringing to market an effective oral P-selectin blocking drug that prevents sickle red blood cell sticking to the lining of blood vessels, improves blood flow, and averts acute painful episodes, the once daily administration of which will promote patient compliance."

"9547566","We do not know why some women who give birth vaginally sustain an extensive major levator ani (LA) muscle tear. Nor do we know why 1 in 10 women suffer pelvic organ prolapse. In 2003, we began testing thishypothesis in a sample of women predisposed for LA injury because all had obstetric events associated with LA trauma (e.g. forceps, anal sphincter tear). With these high risk women, the tear was still only partial, less  than 50% muscle fiber loss. Since it is major LA tear that is associated with prolapse when studied in multipara later in life, we need to learn about LA tear progression from first to second birth and how this contributes to prolapse later in life. We hypothesize that 1) exposure again to vaginal birth after an initial LA partial tear places a woman at high risk for more extensive LA tear, that 2) extension in LA tear is associated with increased pelvic organ descent, and this is because 3) the LA becomes unsupportive when it is no  longer tethered to its origin. We aim to test these hypotheses in a highly efficient prospective cohort design.  About 45% of our previously established cohort of first-birth women showed partial LA tear when evaluated by MRI. and the other half exhibited no evidence of tear despite also having obstetric risk factors for LA tear on first birth. We will study all of the women again to detennine if partial tear determines higher risk for extensive injury and increased prolapse when they birth again. All of the women in this established cohort have consented to further contact. We plan to evaluate those who have given birth vaginally a second time,  comparing MRI data post first birth versus post second birth to quantify change in LA tear status, change in descent of the pelvic organs, and the relationship between the two. The degree of LA tear will be measured using the redesigned and novel instrumented speculum that eliminates crosstalk from intra-abdominal pressure during volitional contraction. Organ descent will be measured by comparing common organ position in both subject MRIs. This project has high impact through three independent pathways to clinical relevance.  It will: 1) close the time-gap between the initial injury (first birth) and later life pronounced prolapse symptoms by demonstrating that injury extension and symptom progression are predicted by partial tear at first birth, 2) begin to shift the current paradigm of elective Cesarean for all to prevent LA injury to data-based selection criteria, and 3) pave the way for new interventions targeted to those women most at risk, those who give  birth again after an initial partial LA tear on first birth."

"9479863","PROJECT SUMMARY: CLINICAL PROJECT 2: PROBING THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ME/CFS The underlying reason for the profound fatigue, pain, cognitive difficulties, and the peculiar response to physical effort of ME/CFS patients, is not understood. One reason that many ME/CFS patients are unable to work is that their maximal ability to produce energy, measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), is extremely low. For many ME/CFS patients an increase in physical or mental activity results in an increase in symptoms termed post-exertional malaise. Prior work by Cornell Center investigators found that most ME/CFS patients who undergo CPET cannot reproduce, a day later, one or more objective measures such as oxygen consumption at maximal threshold intensities, and/or exhibit abnormalities in blood pressure and/or heart rate response. The cause of post-exertional malaise, like the cause of ME/CFS, is not understood, although it is one of the most debilitating symptoms of ME/CFS sufferers.  Our central hypothesis is that the study of postexertional malaise provides an exciting opportunity to obtain new insights into the etiology of ME/CFS. We will obtain samples from patients at several different time points, prior to an exercise challenge, when they are experiencing their usual levels of symptoms, and at a time of heightened symptoms, post exercise, enabling deeper insight into abnormal biological functioning associated with the disease. By analyzing, in conjunction with physiological data, metabolites, circulating inflammatory molecules, and extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo in blood samples from before and after exercise sessions, we aim to uncover markers and mechanisms of post-exertional malaise in ME/CFS. Our broad survey of possible molecular responses to exercise will include inflammatory proteins and immunogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments, targeted and untargeted metabolomics of blood serum, and a detailed proteomic and metabolomic characterization of EVs. EVs are released into the circulation during exercise and could therefore contain biomarkers or contain cargo that plays an active role in mediating the abnormal response to physical activity in ME/CFS. EVs cargo includes signaling proteins, lipids, hormones, and RNAs that can influence the growth, metabolic activity, and gene expression in target cells with which they fuse.  We expect that the metabolomic analyses of serum and EVs have particularly high potential to detect ME/CFS-specific changes in the response to exercise, because the metabolome integrates downstream effects from almost any physiological pathway. Therefore, in addition to conventional targeted metabolomics, we will introduce untargeted metabolomic analyses as a powerful approach toward discovery of new or unexpected ME/CFS-associated changes in primary metabolism or the production of signaling molecules such as hormones, prostaglandins, or neurotransmitters. As a primary outcome of this study, we expect to provide comprehensive data on metabolomic and proteomic changes associated with post-exertional malaise in ME/CFS that will enable identifications of novel markers and mechanisms associated with this disease."
"9482279","ABSTRACT: OVERALL COMPONENT We propose an innovative and synergistic combination of research, career development, and community partnership activities that will engage communities in delivering and disseminating health disparity interventions. Such community involvement has the potential to enhance the innovation, potency, relevance, and sustainability of efforts to reduce health disparities. The Administrative Core will oversee, manage, and coordinate all proposed activities and will facilitate equitable, collaborative, and sustainable relationships with communities, institutions, and other stakeholders. The Investigator Development Core will publicize the availability of a pilot project program and utilize an online system for submission and review of applications. Both academic investigators and community organizations will provide intensive support to pilot awardees to ensure successful project completion. Our two complementary research projects involve novel approaches for engaging community members. The first project seeks to address social contextual factors that function as barriers to hypertension management. We will train lay health advisors to help African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension to address these barriers. The second project seeks to increase the input of health disparity populations into the dissemination of research findings by medical journals. We will train and mentor community members to review manuscripts for two prominent journals. Journal editorial teams will then use these reviews in decisions to accept, revise, or reject manuscripts. The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core will engage with and disseminate research findings to community members, partner organizations, service organizations, policymakers, and scientists. The Community Core will also develop a strategic plan to translate research findings into sustainable community and system-level changes that will have a measurable impact on minority health and health disparities. An independent evaluator will monitor and evaluate the processes and outcomes of our activities. We will use ongoing evaluations to modify and improve our activities. Strengths and innovative features of our application include involvement of a broad range of community organizations, institutions, and multidisciplinary faculty and staff; use of theoretical models or conceptual frameworks to guide the work of each Core and project; synergistic use of overlapping personnel, community partners, and shared activities across Cores and projects; strong institutional commitment by Case Western Reserve University and MetroHealth Medical Center, including provision of additional resources; and the experience, expertise, and prior productivity of the personnel involved in the Center of Excellence."

"9292727","Project Summary:  This proposal seeks to establish an annual short course in Cancer Systems Biology. Systems Biology harnesses ideas and methodologies from mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science to tackle fundamental questions about the organization, design and performance of complex biological systems, questions not easily addressed through traditional molecular and cellular approaches. Such questions are particularly relevant to Cancer Biology, where perturbations at multiple levels of control systems lead to aberrant behaviors and cascading failures in homeostasis leading to disease. The development of high throughput data generation technologies and their application in cancer has led to a shift in focus from individual components of cancer cells (e.g., genes) to large-scale, nonlinearly interacting networks involving signaling and communication of cancer cells with themselves and with their microenvironment. This has naturally led to the introduction of Systems Biology approaches into Cancer Biology and resulted in advances in our fundamental understanding of cancer initiation, progression and response to treatment. Yet widespread integration of Systems and Cancer Biology is hampered by a lack of training. Biologists and clinicians typically do not receive sufficient training in mathematical, statistical and computational tools needed to apply Systems Biology methodologies. On the other hand, physicists, mathematicians and others from non-biomedical fields who have the theoretical and computational knowledge base needed for Systems Biology, typically lack sufficient training in cancer biology needed to apply these methodologies to cancer. The goal of our course is to provide a diverse group of about 20 graduate students, postdocs, and experienced researchers an intensive three-week program at the University of California, Irvine to bridge individual training deficits that pose an obstacle to entry into the Cancer Systems Biology field and to provide a high-level systems biology exploration of a subset of core issues in current cancer research.  The proposed course begins with a one-week Preparatory Workshop in either i) Mathematical and Computational Methods, or ii) Fundamentals of Cancer Biology and Biomedicine, followed by a two-week Core Course in which both lectures and laboratory modules are used to expose participants to cutting-edge methodologies and research topics at the intersection between Systems and Cancer Biology. Lectures and laboratory modules will be given by 19 UCI faculty (both academic and clinical) with research and teaching expertise in mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering and cancer biology. The goals of the course include (1) conveying an understanding of what Systems Biology is; (2) providing a grounding in mathematical and computational fundamentals; (3) fostering a deep understanding of how mathematical, statistical and computational models are used in biology and biomedicine; (4) providing opportunities to apply cutting-edge Systems Biology methods to specific problems in the areas of cancer biology, with an emphasis on the study of cancer cell heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dynamics at the genomic, cellular and microenvironmental levels; and (5) fostering interdisciplinary interactions among participants and teaching faculty. Lecture materials (video recorded), training datasets, and software tools will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach. Course administration and logistics will be handled by the UC Irvine Center for Complex Biological Systems (CCBS), one of thirteen NIH National Centers for Systems Biology, in conjunction with the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center."
"9413176","The overall aim of our CCCR is to develop and provide scientifically rigorous, state-of-the-art methods and resources for conducting musculoskeletal clinical research, thereby expanding the community of investigators performing high-quality musculoskeletal clinical research and thus increasing the amount of available useful data for researchers, clinicians, patients and policy makers. Over the past decade, health care systems having become increasingly integrated and use electronic health record systems that are collecting and archiving comprehensive and complex sets of data on large populations. While the potential for using such ?big data? to address a wide range of health-related questions is enormous, there are substantial obstacles that prevent researchers from accessing and analyzing routine clinical data. Through multiple projects focused on musculoskeletal conditions and funded by a variety of entities (NIH, AHRQ and PCORI), our group at the University of Washington (UW) has accumulated extensive experience and expertise performing large, clinical, effectiveness trials and transforming routine clinical data into research-ready data. We have both developed methods and also have accumulated a sizeable amount of cleaned and analyzable data. Because of our expertise and resources, we believe that we are well-positioned to propose a UW Core Center for Clinical Research (CCCR) in Musculoskeletal Diseases. Our UW CCCR Specific Aims are: 1) Establish a Methodologic Core that will improve methods for clinical musculoskeletal studies that use rigorous and novel study designs, pragmatic/effectiveness clinical trial, and electronic medical records (EMRs); 2) Establish a Resource Core that will provide analysis-ready data sets and services for conducting clinical musculoskeletal research; and 3) Establish an Administrative Core that will provide overall leadership for the CCCR, manage the financial aspects of the CCCR so that it is a sustainable entity, provide communication and outreach to musculoskeletal researchers and evaluate the success of our efforts. By achieving these aims, we will improve access to expertise and research-quality data, we will improve analytics by developing methods and pipelines for the analysis of clinical data, and we will apply and disseminate knowledge regarding the conduct of rigorous clinical trials. By integrating the viewpoints of stakeholders, our CCCR will be able to provide useful research data to health system decision-makers who will apply the results of the research to real-world decisions. By achieving these aims, we will facilitate health care delivery systems becoming true learning health care systems. Finally and perhaps most importantly, we will work with training programs (K12, KL2, R25 and T32) to train the next generation of investigators in the methods and approaches outlined above."
"9416009","Project Summary (Data Core): As described for each of the molecular signatures, anatomy, functional measures and genetic tools research segments, the Comprehensive Center on Mouse Brain Cell Atlas will be generating large scale datasets of different modalities and originating from different institutions. The Data Core will provide centralized data management systems to collect and integrate the diverse data collections and provide data processing and mapping infrastructure and expertise to transform raw data into quantitative cell characterization features. Within this Center, across the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and across the community there is an increasing need to enhance data interoperability and harmonization among data producers to allow meaningful data integration and simplified data accessibility and reuse. Atlases and common coordinate systems play a fundamental role in gathering, analyzing, communicating, and standardizing data. We will develop data management systems to store and manage data and metadata generated from researchers within the Center and facilitate the submission of data and analyses to the BCDC. We will develop tools and methods to support the mapping of data to a mouse brain common coordinate system, and support processing, quantification and analysis for cell type characterization, classification and census. Finally, the Data Core will form a strong partnership with other BICCN centers and the BRAIN Cell Data Center (BCDC) to collaboratively build up brain cell type atlases with broadly accessible common coordinate systems to integrate and disseminate the brain cell census data."
"9422950","Abstract Osteoporosis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. In the United States, over 8 million women and 2 million men age 50 and above have osteoporosis. Another 51 million women and 35 million men have osteopenia. This translates into a higher risk of fracture within this population, with half of all women and one quarter of men projected to suffer a low bone mass-related fracture. Osteoporotic fractures impart deleterious consequences, including increased hospitalization and mortality. An estimated 25% of individuals will die within one year of a hip fracture. Despite the availability of anti-resorptive therapies that decrease fracture rates, their prescription and use have declined significantly due to fears of extremely rare but serious adverse events. This has created a treatment gap that threatens the quality of life of millions of Americans and poses a tremendous challenge to our healthcare systems and economy. It also highlights the need to better understand osteoclast formation and function. The goal of this five-year application is to determine the role of the protein phosphatase Phlpp1 in osteoclastogenesis and bone density and to define the epigenetic mechanisms required for Phlpp1 to modulate Csf1r (c-fms) expression and osteoclastogenesis. The five-year deliverables are: 1) definition of the functions of Phlpp1 in osteoclast progenitor cells, 2) characterization of the cytosolic functions of Phlpp1 that influence M-CSF responsiveness, Csfr1 expression and osteoclast function, and 3) determination of the nuclear functions of Phlpp1 that influence Csfr1 transcription and osteoclastogenesis. This work will increase our understanding of how Phlpp1 and associated pathways affect bone density. "
"9409958","Project Summary/Abstract  Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a principal contributor to transplant related mortality (TRM), and develops in approximately 60-80% of recipients receiving unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) despite standard immunosuppressive prophylaxis. Thus, novel GVHD prophylaxis treatments which successfully attenuate aGVHD and related complications such as infection are urgently needed. In addition, an important function of allogeneic HSCT is to use donor T cells to eliminate allogeneic leukemia cells, this is called the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). However, current prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD is based on general immunosuppression, which causes high risk of infection and cause significant mortality, while contributing to leukemia relapse by reducing GVL. The ultimate goal of this research project is to further the clinical development of a novel drug candidate for the prophylactic treatment of aGVHD in leukemia patients undergoing allogeneic myeloablative HSCT. In preclinical testing in murine models, the drug candidate, CD24Fc, has been shown to significantly reduce GVHD severity and improve in survival while preserving GVL, making it an ideal drug for prophylaxis of GVHD in leukemia patients. The activity associated with GHVD reduction and GVL preservation is strongly supported by in vitro data that describes the mechanism of action of the CD24Fc drug product. CD24Fc has been demonstrated to be safe in healthy human subjects in a Phase I clinical trial and the current project, a Phase IIa clinical trial, aims to provide the first toxicity/safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and biological activity data for CD24Fc in human HSCT transplantation patients. These data demonstrate that we have more than reached the milestones typically set for phase I SBIR grant, and thus qualify us for phase II direct SBIR application. The proposed Phase IIa trial is a randomized double blind single ascending dose trial comprised of 3 dosing cohorts of 8 patients (3:1 treatment:placebo), for a total planned enrollment of 24 subjects. The clinical trial will have two specific aims addressed by different phases: specific aim I will determine the safety and tolerability of CD24Fc in a single ascending dose-escalation study, and define the recommended Phase II dose (or Maximum Tolerated Dose) for prophylaxis of GVHD in a large Phase IIb expansion trial; and specific aim II will assess the pharmacokinetics and in-human activity of CD24Fc in leukemia and myeloid dysplasia syndrome patients receiving HSCT. CD24Fc will be administered to patients on a background of standard of care prophylaxis comprising a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate to maximize patient safety. The proposed study represents a major milestone necessary not only for the development of the novel immunomodulating drug for a GVHD, but also for commercialization effort of the company."
"9419229","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Administrative Core (AC) exists to promote the vision of the Ponce Health Sciences University- Moffitt Cancer Center (PHSU-MCC) Partnership, which is to reduce health disparities in a variety of different ways, ultimately resulting in improved cancer treatments and precision medicine approaches best suited for the Puerto Rico and Florida Hispanic populations.  The AC plays a significant role, serving as the functional infrastructure of the Partnership, promoting innovative cancer research, outreach and biobanking toward an underserved population, and research education of under-represented individuals. Specifically, it provides oversight, organization, and ongoing evaluation for the scientific and administrative aspects of the Partnership. Such oversight includes but is not limited to day-to-day administrative and financial oversight, coordination of activities, and logistical support. Administrative and coordinating activities occur at both institutions, with continuous communications being one of the principal responsibilities of the AC. In the renewal, the AC will retain a composition/configuration similar to that in the current Partnership. This structure is highly effective in providing scientific and administrative oversight while promoting collaboration among the multiple components. For the competitive renewal, the Specific Aims of the AC are to: 1) Provide the functional infrastructure of the Partnership in terms of innovation, direction, leadership, and fiscal/administrative support for the individual scientific projects and cores, 2) Facilitate communications at all levels, 3) Set expectations, provide support, and monitor the productivity of the Partnership?s projects and cores."
"9314538","SUMMARY Project 1 will use a translational research pipeline for human gut microbiota-directed diagnostics and therapeutics we developed based on gnotobiotic mice harboring microbiota transplanted from three types of adult twin pairs discordant for obesity and/or its associated metabolic abnormalities [LeanMetabolicallyHealthy-Obese Metabolically Unhealthy (LnMH/ObMUN), LnMH/ObMH, ObMH/ObMUN]. Its goal is to (i) establish a causal role of the gut microbiota in obesity and associated metabolic phenotypes, (ii) obtain mechanistic insights about the interactions between diet and members of the gut microbiota that produce these phenotypes, (iii) conduct tests of the effects of manipulating diet and bacterial taxa on phenotypes transmitted by ObMUN microbiota. Project 1 has 4 aims. (1) Determine the effects of microbiota, collected from twin pairs at the end of the each of their two in-home diet periods, on body composition/metabolic phenotypes of recipient adult gnotobiotic mice given a diet homologous to that consumed at the time the donor's microbiota was collected or the other diet that twins will have consumed (cross-over diet group). Within-pair, between-twin pair comparisons and across discordant pair type comparisons will be performed. (2) Co-house gnotobiotic mice harboring intact uncultured microbiota from discordant pairs to determine if (i) microbiota from the LnMH donor prevents or ameliorates development of obesity- and obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction in mice colonized with the ObMH or ObMUN co-twin's microbiota, and how prevention/amelioration correlates with invasion of bacterial taxa from the microbiota of one cagemate to the other, and later comparable co-housing experiments involving ObMH and ObMUN mice. (3) Determine if bacterial culture collections prepared from microbiota samples characterized in Aim 2 also transfer discordant donor phenotypes to gnotobiotic mice; perform co-housing experiments to identify invasive cultured taxa associated with phenotypic rescue in different diet contexts. (4) Execute a testing matrix in which a culture collection from a representative ObMUN or ObMH co-twin are introduced to separate groups of gnotobiotic mice fed a representative USA diet high in saturated fats and low in fruits and vegetables, alone or with a lead probiotic consortium (invasive taxa identified from aims 2, 3), or a lead prebiotic (identified from in vitro screen), or a combination of the two (synbiotic lead). The therapeutic lead will be administered at the time of colonization with the culture collection (prevention arm) or 2 weeks after initial colonization (treatment arm). Metabolic profiling will be performed with Core A. Multi-omics datasets will be analyzed with existing tools and used to generate new analysis strategies with Project 3 and Core B."
"9386682","PROJECT SUMMARY  The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests and that translation from in vitro to in vivo and ultimately to clinical application is enabled through a re- optimization process. This input?output relationship that is always based on experimental data in lieu of predicted responses may also lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in cancer therapeutics, among other diseases. In these series of studies they will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by using it to find novel drug combinations of repurposed/repositioned drugs to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is that by the end of year 3 of this project, they will be able to initiate a clinical trial using these novel combination or combinations.  This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. They have shown that this approach was able to markedly improve the efficacy of colorectal cancer therapy in vivo in mouse models. Translationally in a first-in-human clinical trial, they recently completed a prospective clinical study involving 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process. Because PPM does not require a priori knowledge of disease mechanism and because it is a dynamic process that can accommodate a changing system, it can efficiently find personalized drug dosing over a varying range of time, having a profound stabilizing effect on the tacrolimus trough levels.  For this application, they have selected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer) to be the human disease for PPM application. The key rationale for this clinical selection is that they have a wealth of in vitro data on HCC, an active HCC tumor biorepository, and a large clinical volume of patients with HCC. These existing resources, both in vitro and clinical, allow for the immediate exploration of combination discovery followed by a clinical validation of discovered combination candidates in patients with unresectable HCC."
"9450433","Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients despite the advances in early diagnosis and treatment. HIV infection leads to a 1.5 to 2x greater increase in cardiovascular disease risk compared to non-infected populations. While Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) represent 0.4%t/ of the total population in the United States, the HIV case rate for NHOPI was twice that of the White population in 2014. NHOPI with HIV are over 3x more likely to be hospitalized than Whites with HIV. This is likely to compound CVD risk in this minority population. Monocyte/macrophage (MO) plays an essential role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Although it is known that HIV infects monocytes it is not known whether HIV infection alters the atherogenic properties of macrophages. We hypothesize that MO dysregulation is a critical aspect of HIV immune dysregulation responsible for the increased development of atherosclerosis in this population. To elucidate this, we will perform a cross- sectional comparison of MO function in HIV+ individuals including NHOPI on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 72 HIV-uninfected individuals of similar age, gender, and ethnic and socio-demographic composition. The MO functions we will measure are: (1) monocyte inflammatory cytokine production, (2) trans- endothelial migration capacity of monocytes, (3) macrophage cholesterol uptake/ foam cell formation (4) macrophage cholesterol efflux, and (5) intracellular monocyte HIV DNA and RNA level. These parameters will then be compared to the carotid intimal thickness (CIMT) measurements from each of the subjects in an attempt to find associations between MO function and extent of atherosclerosis in each of the populations. The specific aims to be performed in this proposal are: Specific Aim I: To compare inflammatory profiles and trans- migration capacity of monocytes isolated from HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART and HIV non- infected individuals and correlate these parameters with carotid intimal thickness (CIMT) as a marker of atherosclerosis; SPECIFIC AIM II: To assess if differences in macrophage lipid metabolism patterns contribute to increased atherosclerotic burden amongst HIV-infected individuals; and SPECIFIC AIM III: To associate intracellular monocyte HIV DNA and RNA level with atherosclerotic burden among HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART. The innovation of this proposal lies in the ability to link sophisticated laboratory data to provide meaningful data on how monocyte function relates to CVD in the context of HIV. This study will utilize the Research Infrastructure Core which includes resources from Biostatistics Support and Clinical Research Support Facilities. In addition, the study will work with the Community Engagement Core resources to enhance the quality of this translational research, which will result in the enhancement of the UHM?s research capacity within the areas of basic biomedical and clinical research."
"9370748","ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this Administrative Core is to provide a means by which the Translational Center for Molecular Profiling in Preclinical and Established Lupus will function seamlessly, covering many logistic areas. Three Specific Aims are proposed to accomplish this goal: Aim 1: To provide oversight for operational integration of the three Research Projects and two additional Cores (Core 1?Research Technology Core; Core 2?Clinical Core). The Administrative Core will provide governance, infrastructure, budgeting and financial accountability, dissemination of communicative materials, planning meetings and completing administrative tasks for all component Research Projects and Cores. Aim 2: To facilitate meaningful interactions among the Center personnel and the Advisory Committee. Two subaims are proposed: a) to continuously develop new initiatives and strategies to promote the interactions and collaborations among the 3 Research Projects and their interactions with the Cores; b) to facilitate communication between Center personnel and the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee is proposed to comprise 4 researchers with expertise relating to the proposed Research Projects, and 2 laypersons who will provide critical input on patients' perspectives with regard to feasibility of recruitment, ethical issues, personal and population meaningfulness of the work proposed, and dissemination of results. The Director and Associate Director will organize twice-yearly Advisory Committee meetings, at which the Project Leads will give presentations to the group to assess project progress, adherence to timelines and milestones, as well as the merit of proposed Pilot/Feasibility Studies. Aim 3: To foster translational, interdisciplinary research on SLE at the NYU School of Medicine. Three Subaims describe our strategies: a) Clinical/Translational Liaison: Drs. Izmirly, Belmont and the Director ? by virtue of their attendance at clinical sites providing patients for the Clinical Core ? will interact with other Rheumatology faculty, fellows, residents and medical students. Their integral involvement is expected to foster patient interest and education and referral of patients seen by the other health care providers. b) Pilot/Feasibility Project Program: Within the School of Medicine and with support from the CTSI, the Director and Associate Director will publicize the opportunity to apply for Pilot and Feasibility Projects relating to SLE. Both the Director (as Director of the Division of Rheumatology) and Associate Director (as Professor of Medicine and Pathology who teaches courses in immunology and pathogenesis in the School of Medicine and Sackler Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences) are well- positioned to encounter, seek out, and encourage promising applicants for such Projects. c) Enrichment Program: The Director and Associate Director will work with the other Project and Core Leads/Associate Leads to invite visiting scholars to give seminars and interact with members of the Center, and arrange for Center members and their students to attend scientific meetings important for the disease theme of this Center."
"9567683","Cancer Biology ? Project Summary The scientific goal of the Cancer Biology research program (CB) is to understand the molecular mechanisms that define normal and neoplastic cell growth in order to identify and characterize molecules, pathways and processes that are involved in tumor development, growth and progression that can serve as useful biomarkers and/or as new cellular targets for cancer therapeutics and prevention. CB represents the basic science initiatives of The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) and is unified by member utilization of molecular, biochemical and cell-based approaches to understand normal and cancer cell behavior. The Specific Aims of CB are: 1) to promote collaboration that enhances discovery of the mechanisms underlying tumor development, progression and malignant behavior; and 2) to leverage basic science discoveries to inspire pre-clinical and clinical development of novel cancer therapies. CB has 49 full members and 12 associate members from 17 departments located at KUMC, KU-Lawrence and Stowers. In 2015, CB garnered nearly $17M in cancer-related, peer-reviewed funding ($2M from NCI, $12.2M other NIH). CB members have published 617 articles since 2012 of which 144 (23%) had intra-programmatic, 128 (21%) had inter-programmatic and 315 (51%) had inter-institutional collaborations. These publications have been cited over 5,600 times, have an average journal impact factor (JIF) of 7.3 and 167 (27%) have a JIF?8. CB is jointly led by Kristi Neufeld (KU-Lawrence) and Linheng Li (Stowers), who bring complementary scientific expertise in cell biology, stem cell biology, biochemistry and translational research, leadership experience and diverse institutional representation. Danny Welch, Associate Director for Basic Science & Education and Jim Calvet, KUCC Research Staff Investigator, round out the leadership team and represent KUMC. Intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations are fostered by research retreats, seminars, research symposia and targeted pilot funding. CB has taken advantage of historical strengths in the study of three tumor sites over-represented in either incidence or mortality rate in the KUCC catchment area population (GI, kidney and hematopoietic). But rather than a disease-based thematic organization, CB members have expertise that can be organized into four discipline-based themes: 1) Cancer Cell Biology and Stem Cell Biology; 2) Cell Proliferation, Differentiation and Death; 3) Chromatin Organization and Transcriptional Regulation; and 4) Signaling Pathways and Development."
"9406667","There is insufficient research-based data on remedial interventions for children and adolescents who do not receive early interventions or receive them and show persistent reading difficulties. This is especially true for students who are English learners (Els), where there is relatively little research addressing Els in middle schools at a point when their reading problems are significantly disabling and presage adverse academic and behavioral outcomes associated with reading disabilities. Consistent with the RFA, we focus on Els as a group that is historically underserved and at a time in their development when it is possible to deliver reading comprehension interventions sufficiently intense to ameliorate a host of adverse outcomes. From a scientific perspective, the focus on persistent reading difficulties in any sociodemographic subgroup is important given the small effects associated with remedial interventions, which is compounded by the lack of research on adolescent Els. Aim 1 determines the efficacy of reading comprehension interventions integrating attention and self-regulation practices for Els in Grades 7 and 8 with persistent reading difficulties. Building on previous intervention studies we have conducted with students in Grades 4 through 8 over the past 10 years111, we propose a longitudinal, double-cohort design utilizing a randomized control trial assigning students to supplemental reading intervention or a ?business as usual? control condition (i.e., Cohort 1 ? Years 1 and 2; 205 students in treatment and 205 in control condition; Cohort 2 ? Years 3 and 4; 205 students in treatment and 205 in control condition; total 410 in each condition). Students in each cohort will be treated for 2 years (i.e., 7th and 8th grade) and then followed for one year (9th grade). Aim 2 determines the impact of co- occurring conditions such as attention problems and English language proficiency on a range of student outcomes including reading-related outcomes, math outcomes, and writing outcomes. Aim 3 examines student characteristics and contextual factors associated with response to intervention as a means of informing treatment decisions, and to determine the extent to which response to intervention can be predicted initially and longitudinally from students' characteristics (e.g., attention) and contextual factors (e.g., teachers' knowledge, school effectiveness ratings). Project 3 (Intervention) is closely tied by its longitudinal design to Projects 2-5, including the epigenetic focus of Project 5 (Epigenetics), and conceptually to Project 1 (Integration), with its focus on syntheses of intervention practices and reciprocal cross-project analyses. It is expected that this robust model of examining the efficacy of improving reading comprehension and outcomes primarily for reading and secondarily for writing for students in the middle grades will yield high impact on instructional practices for remediating reading difficulties generally, and specifically in Els."
"9442232","Project Summary Population-level approaches for obesity prevention that leverage behavioral science have potential for large reach and sustainability. Behaviorally-informed interventions such as traffic light nutrition labels, choice architecture (product placement), social norms (peer comparison) feedback, and financial incentives improve healthy food choices in cafeteria settings. Although these interventions change behavior in the short-term, it is not known whether they can induce long-term behavior changes and improve health. It is also unknown whether psychological traits, cognitive skills, and genes moderate the effects of these interventions on behavior and health. The long-term goal is to identify low-cost, targeted, and scalable behavioral interventions to increase healthy food choices and prevent obesity. The overall objective of this project is to examine the psychological traits, cognitive skills, and genes that may influence the impact of a behaviorally-informed intervention on dietary choices, weight, and other objective health indicators. To achieve this objective, the research team is conducting a randomized controlled trial to test an innovative behavioral intervention to prevent weight gain and reduce cardiometabolic risk factors over two years in 600 hospital employees who visit the worksite cafeterias ( ). This intervention targets intentions, knowledge, skills, and the R01 HL125486 environment to encourage healthier food choices. At the hospital worksite, all cafeterias use traffic- light nutrition labels (green=healthy, yellow=less healthy, red=unhealthy). A one-year intervention, designed to increase employees' awareness and use of the traffic lights, includes: 1) personalized, automated messaging about food purchases and health behaviors; 2) social norms comparisons; and 3) financial incentives. Outcomes measured at baseline and one and two-year follow ups include: weight/BMI, blood pressure, lipids, hemoglobin A1c; cafeteria purchases; and 24-hour dietary recalls. The proposed research will significantly expand on this work by examining psychological traits (impulsivity, self-control, social acceptance), cognitive skills (numeracy, health literacy), and genes (97 known BMI loci) that are associated with obesity and poor health and are specifically targeted by the intervention. We will use validated measures to assess traits and skills and well-established methods for genotyping and calculating genetic risk scores. Aim 1 will determine if psychological traits moderate the behavioral intervention effects on diet and weight. Aim 2 will determine if cognitive skills moderate the behavioral intervention effects on diet and weight. Aim 3 will determine if genetic risk for obesity moderates the intervention effect on weight. In secondary analyses, potential mediators of diet and weight outcomes, including dietary intent, self-efficacy, reward sensitivity, perceived norms, and perceived stress, will be assessed. Implications: Results of this research will l will inform the future design and implementation of more effective, tailored, and sustainable population approaches for obesity prevention."
"9484592","Abstract  Research Project 1 of the proposed Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO) is titled  HoMBRES de Familia (Hispanic Men Building Respect, Education, and Safety within Families /Hombres  Manteniendo Respeto, Educacion y Seguridad de Familia). The overall objective of this project is to adapt  and enhance HoMBReS, a CDC-identified best-evidence HIV behavioral intervention designed to reduce  substance abuse, family violence, and HIV/AIDS (SAVA) among sexually active heterosexual Latino seasonal  farmworkers (LSFWs) in rural areas. Research Project 1 is integrated with the Center through a common set of  measures and research questions on the syndemic approach. This application leverages the success of the  originating Centers of Excellence and considerable institutional resources and support and community  partnerships. The Lead of this project is an early career investigator who is an Assistant Professor associated  with CRUSADA. Building on the work of El Centro and CRUSADA over the last decade, HoMBRES de Familia  will utilize a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to develop and test a gender and  culturally tailored intervention to prevent SAVA conditions in a vulnerable and underserved Latino population.  The proposed interdisciplinary study will innovatively expand the SAVA syndemic paradigm by testing its  etiologic theory through a carefully designed prevention trial. We will examine theorized risk and protective  factors influencing the SAVA conditions among a never-before examined population (male LSFWs),  demonstrate that these factors are malleable, and that changes in these mechanisms can impact SAVA  outcomes. A two-arm randomized control trial will be conducted to examine the efficacy of the adapted  intervention with a sample of 160 father-son dyads (N=320). The proposed mixed-methods study will be  accomplished through the following Specific Aims: (1) Conduct a community assessment via qualitative data  methods (in-depth interviews; focus groups) that will inform the adaptation of an evidence-based intervention  targeting the SAVA syndemic among adult and adolescent males in the Latino seasonal farmworker  community; (2) Adapt, implement, and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention; and (3) In  combination with the Community Engagement and Dissemination Core, develop an effective dissemination  plan that engages community members, partnering organizations, local service providers, and other  stakeholders in disseminating study findings into a sustainable intervention that effectively reduces SAVA-  related health disparities among males in the LSFW community. Miami-Dade County has the highest rate of  HIV/AIDS in the country and high rates of substance abuse and violence. LSFWs face disproportionate rates of  SAVA conditions, and Miami-Dade County has one of the largest populations of LSFWs in the nation; this site  is the ideal testing laboratory for the proposed Research Project."
"9421609","Project Summary The Eck laboratory at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute studies the structure and regulation of oncogenic protein kinases. We apply our unique structural and mechanistic insights in collaborative drug discovery efforts to develop inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action and with selectivity for mutant kinases. The Research Specialist is an expert in structural biology (primarily X-ray crystallography), protein biochemistry and ligand- binding studies, enzyme kinetics, and computational approaches (including virtual ligand screening) and has extensive experience applying these approaches in studies of protein kinases. She is driving our research program in two major areas of interest: 1) development of mutant-selective inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutants in lung adenocarcinoma, and 2) the structure, regulation, and mechanism of oncogenic activation of BRAF, which is relevant to many cancers. In our studies of these kinases, we seek to understand at a structural level how the activity of the kinase is normally regulated and how this regulation is subverted by oncogenic mutations. With our collaborators in medicinal chemistry and cellular pharmacology, the Research Specialist is developing inhibitors that are effective against EGFR mutants that are resistant to all current targeted therapies, including exon 20 insertion variants of EGFR and EGFR bearing both the T790M and C797S secondary resistance mutations. In addition, the Research Specialist is working to determine the three-dimensional structure of intact BRAF in an autoinhibited state. This work will show how diverse oncogenic mutations lead to BRAF activation and elucidate the mechanism by which many BRAF-targeted drugs induce paradoxical activation of the wild type kinase. In addition, it can be expected to open new avenues for development of BRAF inhibitors that do not exhibit paradoxical activation, and may therefore be effective in the KIAA1549:BRAF truncation fusion found in pediatric brain cancers."
"9410031","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposed NIH SBIR Phase II program will be to continue development and commercialization of a new noninvasive transdermal alcohol monitor. The monitor will be in wristband or watch form, similar to a smartwatch. This device will be modern, attractive and comfortable and will have smartwatch features including measuring key physiological parameters (e.g., pulse) with wireless communication to apps on smartphones and other devices. The aim of the work is to provide a new, noninvasive transdermal alcohol monitor into the market. The transdermal alcohol monitoring market has few wearable products available and innovation has been lacking in this field. This new product will take advantage of current trends in wearable technology. As the public becomes more comfortable with wearables, the blood alcohol monitor will become popular with people interested in health and fitness who want to track their alcohol intake. The product will provide a new, highly reliable and sensitive method for tracking blood alcohol which will eventually be adopted in other areas, including clinical and medical treatment and employee wellness programs. The device is expected also to provide a more effective system than is currently available for alcohol research. The monitor is based on the KWJ Engineering?s printed electrochemical gas sensor. This ethanol sensor is very small, ultralow power and highly sensitive with very low interferences. These characteristics provide a sensor that is more effective than those used in current technologies. Additionally, because of its size and power requirements, it is the only gas sensor available that is compatible with modern applications such as the watch format of this proposal. In Phase I, we demonstrated stable and sensitive measurement of ethanol across human skin surrogate membranes with a first prototype wristwatch device that included the ethanol sensor and circuitry for performing the measurement and converting data for wireless communication to a computer. Raw transdermal ethanol concentrations (TAC) were calibrated to blood alcohol values using standardized ethanol solutions as a surrogate for blood alcohol concentration (BAC). We demonstrated a high degree of reproducibility across several watch format devices. In Phase II, development of the device will be continued in collaboration with partners specializing in wearable systems and product development. A small human trial will be conducted to evaluate the wearability and functionality of the Phase II prototype device."
"9450138","Abstract  Metabolic syndrome, driven mainly by obesity is a global epidemic that increases the risk of  several chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is prevalent in male and female  African Americans (AAs) of all ages. Low plasma levels of adiponectin, a protein secreted by  adipose tissue are implicated in the development of T2D in obese AAs. Although, initially  characterized as a xenobiotic nuclear receptor important for defense against toxic agents, the  pregnane X receptor (PXR) appears to be linked to lipid and glucose metabolism contributing to  the metabolic syndrome epidemic. We find that the impact of PXR on HFD-induced obesity and  hyperglycemia is sex- and species-dependent. However, the specific mechanisms linking PXR  to these diseases remain unclear. Thus, our long term goal is to identify ethnic- and sex-  specific targets for lipid-associated diseases (such as obesity and T2D) that disproportionately  threaten cardiovascular health in AAs, to develop novel prevention and treatment strategies.  The objectives of our proposal are: 1) to investigate whether PXR polymorphisms, more  common in AAs are associated with known increases in obesity risk and 2) to understand the  underlying molecular mechanisms by which the PXR gene and/or its variants regulate lipid,  glucose, and sex hormone metabolism, leading to either enhanced obesity or T2D upon HFD  feeding. Guided by compelling preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that PXR  deficiency results in impaired adiponectin signaling leading to insulin resistance and  glucose intolerance with more prominent race and sex differences. We will use human  blood and liver tissue samples and 3 genetic models of mice with differential PXR activity (wild  type, PXR-knockout, and PXR-humanized mice), along with molecular and cellular studies. Aim  1 investigates the effect of the human PXR gene and its polymorphisms on obesity risk in AAs.  Aim 2 determines the genetic and metabolic factors that contribute to resistance to HFD-  induced obesity in Pxr-null mice. Aim 3 explores the relationship between obesity-induced  diabetes and hypoadiponectinemia in mice with different PXR activity. Our studies are novel in  using clinically relevant PXR-humanized (hPXR) mice to characterize function and regulation of  PXR. This study is significant in providing valuable insights in similarities and differences in  phenotypic expression and signal transduction pathways between the mouse PXR and the  human PXR gene in contributing to the development of obesity and T2D in the different  genders. Our studies should provide ground-breaking advances into pathways that can be  targeted for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome in AAs."
"9422078","PROJECT SUMMARY DESCRIPTION: Dementia, especially Alzheimer's dementia (AD), is a growing public health problem with a prevalence of 5M in the US alone (33M worldwide). Despite a decrease in incidence rates, with the aging of the population, the prevalence of dementia is expected to increase to 16M in the US (115M worldwide) with associated costs rising to $1T. Delaying long-term care by 1 month for older Americans would save $60B annually in direct care cost. Efforts to prevent or delay dementia have been largely unsuccessful. However, major depressive disorder in late life (?late-life depression?, LLD) has been identified as one of six treatable risk factors for dementia, especially AD and vascular dementia. The depression-dementia relationship may be magnified in elders who do not respond to antidepressant treatment and experience persistent symptoms. Thus, resolving whether those with treatment-resistant late-life depression (TRLLD) are at higher risk of cognitive decline and progression to dementia compared to those with treatment-responsive LLD is critically important. Leveraging a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)-funded treatment study of N=1500 people with LLD, across 5 sites, we propose to comprehensively delineate neurocognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers associated with progression to dementia in people with persistent LLD (i.e., TRLLD) compared to those whose LLD remits with treatment. We anticipate enrolling 750 elders with LLD and characterizing their symptomatic trajectory over 24 months. We will assess each participant at three time points with neurocognitive and advanced neuroimaging. We hypothesize that changes in executive functions and the executive control network, as well as changes in episodic memory and the default mode/cortico-limbic network, will be greater in those with TRLLD than in those who respond to treatment and stay well. We also hypothesize that changes over two years in executive function and episodic memory will be specifically associated with changes in executive- control and cortico-limbic circuitry, respectively. Based on our recent findings that inflammatory and related molecular markers can differentiate those with neurocognitive impairment and LLD from those with LLD alone, we will build a predictive multivariate model combining baseline neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and plasma protein data to determine who is at greatest risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Finally, we will also explore whether latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms can go beyond the dichotomy of remission/non-remission to identify subsets of elders with LLD at highest risk of cognitive decline, neural circuit change, and progression to dementia. This work will set the stage for neural circuit- targeted preventive care to delay dementia in subsets of older patients with LLD. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting the depression- dementia pathway and reduce suffering for large numbers of elders and their families."
"9465101","Project Summary/Abstract The 28 nursing programs at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) face several common challenges. Many of their students are low-income, enter with academic deficits, have children, and/or hold minimum-wage jobs, leading to weaker student retention, graduation and nursing-board passing rates. As institutional support has dropped in recent years, faculty and administrators have less time and resources to strengthen their teaching, leadership and student-preparation skills. HBCU nursing schools could benefit greatly from sharing successful teaching practices and student-support tools, yet no organization has ever brought them together. They have rarely collaborated simply for lack of resources and a mechanism. The National League for Nursing (NLN) represents 1,234 nursing programs and 40,000+ nursing faculty. It is the only entity whose senior executives have served as HBCU deans and faculty. NLN provides extensive training and coaching in academic leadership development, faculty development, and student performance. We propose forming the first ongoing coalition of HBCU nursing programs. At its first annual conference, we will introduce best practices and tools developed by successful schools and NLN to 5-person teams of key faculty and administrators from six schools in greatest need. For faculty participants, we will share resources to build pedagogical and clinical teaching skills. For deans and administrators, we will provide training on basic leadership skills; funding; budgeting; internal/external advocacy; and faculty performance. We will introduce PASS, a toolkit and guidance for faculty to better prepare their students for the nursing licensure exam (e.g., by providing students with NLN pre-test exams). Teams will collaborate in crafting a leadership and faculty development action plan tailored to its school's specific needs. Through periodic mentoring over 12 months, a follow-up local action group meeting, and a virtual follow-up meeting, NLN will help the schools complete and implement their action plans, deliver PASS to students, trouble-shoot problems, and evaluate and improve the coalition's programming. In the Year 2 conference, 2-3 schools will join the original six to craft action plans and build PASS into a model Student Success Support Center (SSSC). NLN will likewise support them with periodic mentoring and two mid-year follow-up meetings. The third annual conference will bring 2-3 more schools into this group to draft action plans, receive mentoring and mid-year support, and finalize the SSSC. Each year, we will evaluate key metrics, including student retention, graduation and nursing-board passing rates; faculty development activities; and curriculum changes. Finally, NLN will disseminate the resulting training program, SSSC toolkit and guidance, best practices, tools, and outcomes data throughout our nationwide membership. For the first time ever, this 3-year conference series would bring change agents from HBCU nursing schools together with experts to improve HBCU leadership skills, faculty skills, and student performance."

"9397378","PROJECT SUMMARY Histones play a major role in the regulation of transcription across the animal kingdom, and different variants play important roles in a variety of specific tissues and processes. Two recently-described histones, H3.X and H3.Y, are primate-specific and are expressed in human testis and brain, as well as some tumors and cancer cell lines. My preliminary studies have identified these genes as targets of DUX4, a double-homeobox transcription factor that is normally expressed in the germ cells of the testis. When mis-expressed in muscle, DUX4 causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a progressive disease for which there are no treatments, and may drive some cancers. Expression of DUX4 drastically alters transcription and leads to de- repression of many genes and sequences throughout the genome that are normally repressed in heterochromatin. H3.X/Y have been validated as histones and shown to facilitate a more open chromatin conformation than H3.3 in vitro, but their in vivo effects in FSHD are as yet unknown. Aim 1 will identify genes that go from off to on and inaccessible chromatin to an open chromatin state with expression of DUX4. It will then determine whether H3.X/Y are preferentially incorporated at these loci as well as examining their effects on expression. This will determine the genome-wide incorporation of H3.X/Y in FSHD and effects on expression of DUX4 targets. Aim 2 will determine the role of H3.X/Y in epigenetic memory of the DUX4 transcriptome. It will extend preliminary studies suggesting that H3.X/Y increase the perdurance of DUX4 target expression as well as examine the effects over time of H3.X/Y on chromatin structure and features of heterochromatin. Additionally, this aim will examine the relationship between cumulative DUX4 toxicity, H3.X/Y, and cell cycle, as mature muscle is postmitotic. Epigenetic memory mediated through histone variants could explain why FSHD pathology is typically restricted to muscle and suggest a mechanism to target for therapy. Additionally, the datasets will be independently useful to determine chromatin changes induced by DUX4 that can be applied to the study of FSHD. This proposal will test the hypotheses that H3.X/Y are incorporated into and facilitate expression of genes transcriptionally activated by DUX4 that are normally repressed by heterochromatin, and provide an epigenetic memory of the DUX4 transcriptional program."
"9486483","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV transmission can be decreased substantially by reducing the proportion of undiagnosed infections and expanding early and consistent use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In fact, Treatment as Prevention (TasP) has been proposed as key to ending the HIV epidemic. To activate TasP in high prevalence countries, like South Africa, communities must be motivated to know their status, engage in care, and remain in care - community mobilization (CM) is needed. CM has the potential to significantly increase uptake testing, linkage to and retention in care, essential to population level declines in HIV by addressing the primary social barriers to engagement with the HIV care system. CM strategies for linkage and retention have not yet been rigorously evaluated despite their promise. To address this gap, we aim to implement and evaluate a theory-based CM intervention addressing known social barriers to engagement in care with the aim of increasing HIV testing uptake, thereby decreasing undiagnosed infections (aims 1), improving linkage to care (aim 2), and increasing retention in care (aim 3) in rural South Africa, while also exploring the mechanisms through which CM improves outcomes along the care cascade (aim 4). The CM intervention will be evaluated by comparing gains in testing, linkage, and retention in care in 16 intervention na?ve communities (8 intervention and 8 control) within a health and demographic surveillance site (HDSS) in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa. The CM intervention is based on four years of formative social science research and two years of implementation experience in the area utilizing the same conceptual model developed by our team. The intervention activities map onto six domains of CM that must be addressed for CM to successfully occur: 1) development of a shared concern around TasP; 2) community sensitization or building of critical consciousness; 3) an organizational structure to links to groups/networks in supporting TasP; 4) leadership; 5) collective activities/actions; and 6) community cohesion. Mobilization activities include pilot-tested strategies and will be carried out by our implementing partner, Sonke Gender Justice. To measure rates of testing, linkage and retention, we will link an existing electronic clinical tracking system in use in all clinics in the HDSS to the longitudinal HDSS census data. This provides a unique opportunity to establish an open, population-based cohort with over 30,000 18-49 year old residents. Merging census and clinical data allows us to simultaneously evaluate the effects of our intervention and to characterize the HIV care cascade in a high prevalence population. In addition, we will evaluate CM processes by conducting community based surveys to monitor intervention exposure and community level change using validated measures of CM. This proposal builds on our teams experience with CM in the study area and a strong team of partners-we are well positioned to conduct a rigorously designed and evaluated trial to determine the impact of CM on the care cascade, helping to fill an urgent need."

There are currently no HIV therapeutics targeting any of the proteins on which the HARC Center is focused (HIV-1 Vif, Vpu, Nef, Tat and Rev proteins and their interacting viral and cellular partners). The scientific focus of the Center is on determining structures of these complexes, using an integrated Systems to Structure pipeline that includes (1) Discovery, through novel methods of functional proteomics and genetics being developed in the HARC Center, (2) Validation through breakthrough CRISPR methods in primary T cells as well as targeted in vivo and in vitro functional assays, and (3) Structure Determination using a synthesis of innovative structural techniques developed in the HARC Center to address the large, flexible, heterogeneous and sometimes membrane-associated systems we study. We are focused on two themes aimed at understanding the biological questions surrounding HIV replication and persistence in the host cell. These include how the virus counteracts host restriction mechanisms (Theme 1: ?Counteracting?) and how the virus hijacks host systems for viral transcription and RNA export/trafficking to ensure continuation of the viral life cycle (Theme 2: ?Hijacking?). The seven projects proposed here include: (1) Structure and Evolution of APOBEC3-Vif Interactions, (2) Regulation of Vif and Rewiring of Host Pathways, (3) The Multiple Functions of Vpu at the Membrane, (4) Nef Interaction Networks at the Membrane, (5) Tat-Host Transcription Complexes, (6) Structure and Dynamics of Rev and RNA-Host Complexes, and (7) Characterization of ?Super Restriction Factors? and Prediction of Host-HIV Interfaces. The HARC Center projects are supported by an administrative core and seven technology cores essential for their completion: (1) Proteomic Approaches to HIV Function, (2) CRISPR in Primary Cells to Study HIV-Host Function, (3) Molecular Imaging Using Cryo-Electron Microscopy (EM), (4) Application and Development of Antibody Tools, (5) Integrative Modeling of HIV-Human Complexes, (6) X-ray Screening and Rapid Structure Determination, and (7) Membrane Protein Expression/Purification. We are committed to collaborating with Sister Centers and the HIV research community as well as training the next generation of investigators. We create and support opportunities including the Technology Training Residency to bring young investigators to learn in our Center's Cores, and we seed new research through the Collaborative Opportunity Fund, along with holding events such as seminars and an annual symposium."
"9564278","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large percentage of patients may not be in SCD specialty care, and may face barriers to care. For adults, not having specialty care may be fatal, because specialists may prescribe Hydroxyurea (HU), the first and only FDA approved remittive drug for SCD. Additional barriers to HU include physician fears or misconceptions about its use, inconsistent determination of HU eligibility and inconsistent dose escalation, and patient failure to take HU, due to ignorance or mistrust of relative benefit sand harms, inconvenience associated with therapy, or poor medication access. To overcome these barriers, the state of Virginia, including the Virginia Department of Health and two academic medical centers, plans a two phase demonstration, first of improvement in the percentage of adults with SCD who are in SCD specialty care (PhaseI), then of improvement in adherence to HU of eligible SCD adults (PhaseII). Both phases will use existing academic SCD providers, and an innovative, multimodal strategy, featuring specially trained SCD patient navigators (PNs), that addresses barriers to care and to HU use. In Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing PNs to overcome patient access barriers to SCD care. In Phase II we will test the efficacy of PNs for overcoming barriers to acceptance of and adherence with Hu therapy. Patients will be randomized to a PN or usual care arm. Providers will implement NIH guidelines for HU eligibility and prescribing in both arms. The primary outcome variable for Phase I will be the percentage of enrollees who in the subsequent three months achieve a visit with a specialty SCD provider. The primary outcome for Phase II will be improvement in the HbF level at 1 year post randomization. Secondary outcomes will include: four measures of adherence to HU; percent of patients achieving either maximum tolerated dose, a clinical endpoint, or maximum dose; ED and hospital visits; mean corpuscular volume; total hemoglobin; white blood cell count; reticulocyte count; and quality of life. Co variates in PhaseII will include: patient demographics; genotype; social support; SCD associated pain conditions; mental health status and alcohol use; and coping measures. This project will be critically important and impactful by demonstrating the feasibility of a statewide community based strategy to assist vulnerable SCD adults in obtaining SCD specialty care and likely prolonging life, a model that other states could adopt."
"9386953","Glaucoma describes a group of eye diseases characterized by progressive damage to the optic nerve, leading to impaired vision and blindness if untreated. POAG, the most common type in the world and SSA, has a major heritable component in all populations including those of African descent. Vision loss from glaucoma is permanent but can be prevented if it is diagnosed and treated in time. Individuals with glaucoma are often asymptomatic until late in the disease process, when vision loss is advanced in one or both eyes. In developing countries, like those in SSA, over 90% of persons with glaucoma do not know they have it. The prevalence and severity of glaucoma is very high in SSA, approximately 40% are blind in one or both eyes when first seen. For these reasons, glaucoma presents a major public health burden with broad social and economic consequences, especially in SSA. Despite this huge health and socioeconomic burden, public awareness is low and methods to identify glaucoma before it has caused severe vision loss?such as vision screening for the general population?have been ineffective. However, since POAG is highly inherited, targeting high-risk families that have members that were blinded by the disease at an early age offers a potentially powerful way to diagnose glaucoma in their family members before they too are blinded. In fact, reports where selective, targeted screening of high-risk families have been conducted in SSA suggest that this may be an effective approach. We screened high-risk families in Nigeria who had early-onset severe POAG and found that 45% of the first-degree relatives either had POAG or were glaucoma suspects. In this proposal we will evaluate the efficacy of this approach to identify glaucoma at an early, more readily treated stage. We will provide information to family members to increase glaucoma awareness, refer those diagnosed with POAG or suspect status for evaluation and treatment. In addition, we will enroll these families for genetic linkage studies (Project 1) to help determine the underlying genetic cause. "

"9346470","PROJECT SUMMARY The glycosylation of therapeutic proteins, such as antibodies, is well known to affect bioactivity, however, uniform glycosylation is challenging to achieve when glycoproteins are produced in bioreactors. One approach to obtaining well-defined homogeneous glycosylation is to use glycosidases and glycosyl transferases (glycoenzymes) to modify the glycosylation of the protein, post-production. This approach is often referred to as in vitro glycoengineering. However, unlike traditional small-molecule chemical synthesis, there are no convenient cost-effective methods or kits for monitoring the progress of the enzyme reactions during glycoengineering. Here, we propose to develop an innovative technology called GlycoSense that will permit in vitro glycoenzyme reactions to be monitored in near real-time using flow cytometry with bead-based glycan- specific reagents. Flow cytometry was chosen as the preferred platform because the data are statistically robust, the equipment is relatively commonplace, the analyses consume very low quantities of sample, and it will enable G&D to leverage its proprietary experience in producing carbohydrate-sensing reagents. In this Phase I application, we will demonstrate the ability of our GlycoSense technology to monitor the effect of glycoenzymes applied to the glycoengineering of commercial therapeutic biologics, provided by a major biopharmaceutical company. These biologics were chosen for the present proof of concept studies because of their medical importance and because of the emerging potential of glycoengineering in the development of biosimilars and biobetters."
"9413618","PROJECT ABSTRACT  Pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases challenge the clinical researcher: they affect the population across the lifespan, impact a broad range of patient-centered outcomes, are rarely cured, and often have multiple possible treatment strategies. If properly addressed, these factors present tremendous opportunities for improving patient care and outcomes of patients. The overarching goal of the Brigham and Women?s Hospital (BWH) CCCR is to facilitate advancements in the methodologic sciences supporting clinical research within the NIAMS pediatric and adult rheumatic and musculoskeletal (MSK) disease missions.  VERITY is organized around central scientific themes that can be applied to multiple rheumatic and MSK diseases. The Cores address the following cross-cutting areas: 1) including patients in clinical trial design, outcome selection, result interpretation, and dissemination; 2) integrating behavioral economics to enhance benefits of known interventions, i.e., adherence to medications, engagement in physical activity and weight loss; 3) extracting maximum information content from big data; 4) using smart technologies (mobile health) to advance clinical research; and 5) disseminating knowledge and mentoring of local and national rheumatic and MSK disease clinical researchers through distributed learning models. These scientific themes will be approached through several Cores described in the following Specific Aims. 1. To strategically direct, supervise, and provide financial accountability to VERITY and to train a broad group of local and national investigators for patient-oriented clinical research in pediatric and adult rheumatic and MSK diseases. (Administrative Core) 2. To develop and implement state of the art methods in innovative trials and longitudinal comparative effectiveness studies for rheumatic and MSK disease research. (Methodology Core) 3. To support bioinformatic approaches to enhance utilization of large databases for phenotyping relevant patients, and implementing biomarker, electronic medical record, and comparative effectiveness analyses.

"9318110","Project Summary Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes epidemics of rheumatologic disease. In the last decade, CHIKV has reemerged to cause outbreaks of unprecedented scale in islands of the Indian Ocean, India, South East Asia, and Europe. In 2013, CHIKV reached the Western Hemisphere, where it is responsible for an ongoing outbreak in the Americas that has affected millions. Large populations of the world are at risk for CHIKV outbreaks due to the expansive range of its mosquito vectors. Up to two thirds of individuals infected with CHIKV experience an incapacitating arthralgia that persists for months or years after the initial infection and is linked to persistent infection of musculoskeletal tissue. Vaccines and antiviral agents are not currently available for CHIKV infection, and treatment is limited to managing symptoms with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Very little is known about the pathogenesis of CHIKV infection, which is a significant impediment to developing novel prevention or treatment. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate CHIKV persistence and chronic disease. Addressing this gap has the potential to guide CHIKV vaccine design and provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of acute and chronic CHIKV disease. This proposal takes advantage of attenuated and pathogenic CHIKV strains that differ in their ability to establish persistence in musculoskeletal tissue of infected mice. The central hypothesis is that efficient T follicular helper (TFH) cell responses contribute to clearance of the acute CHIKV strain 181/25 and that impairment of TFH cell responses promotes persistence of the pathogenic CHIKV strain AF15561 in an otherwise immunocompetent host. Guided by substantial preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To define TFH and germinal center (GC) B cell differentiation during acute and chronic CHIKV infection, 2) Determine whether the function of TFH cells is altered during pathogenic CHIKV infection, and 3) Define the requirement for TFH cells in CHIKV clearance. Under the first aim, the magnitude of the TFH, T follicular regulatory (TFR; a specialized follicular T cell population that regulates TFH cell functions), and GC B cell response during acute and chronic CHIKV infection will be measured by flow cytometry analysis of endogenous cells and transferred TCR transgenic T cells. Under the second aim, the quality of the TFH and GC B cell response during acute and chronic CHIKV infection will be measured by response to immunizations, molecular analysis of isolated TFH and TFR cells, and in vitro TFH stimulation assays. In the final aim, mice that lack TFH cells will be infected to determine whether the absence of TFH cells converts an acutely cleared CHIKV strain to a chronic infection. The proposed research is significant because it will provide new insight into the immunologic mechanisms that facilitate persistence of CHIKV in musculoskeletal tissue. Ultimately, this knowledge will provide an important foundation for the development of vaccines and novel therapeutics that may improve the prevention and treatment of CHIKV infection."

As stated in the RFA, the primary goal of this proposal is to continue clinical and translational research on rare pediatric liver disease that include: biliary atresia; Alagille syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis syndromes, bile acid synthesis defects, mitochondrial hepatopathies, idiopathic neonatal hepatitis, and cystic fibrosis liver disease. It is anticipated that the network will consist of up to 15 clinical sites and a single data coordinating center (DCC). The DCC for the ChiLDReN study is charged with providing coordination, communications and logistical support, clinical study design, centralized data management, biosample management, quality assurance, and analytical support to the research sites and the NIDDK Project Scientist for all ChiLDReN studies. The proposing team is submitting this response to RFA-DK-13-011 to continue as the DCC for the network."
"9514390","Contact PD/PI: Khosla, Sundeep Clinical and Translational Science (CTS) has been a fundamental and highly valued element of Mayo Clinic since its founding, and Mayo Clinic's mission ?to provide the best care to every patient every day through integrated clinical practice, education, and research? has always aligned well with the NCATS mission. Mayo Clinic is an integrated academic group practice with major sites in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida; a large community Health System (MCHS) in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa; and an affiliated national ?Care Network? (MCCN). Thus, the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS) is of national scope. MCHS and MCCN provide unique laboratories for late-stage dissemination and implementation research as well as for the conduct of high-priority clinical trials in community health care organizations. Mayo Clinic is also leading both a PCORI CDRN and a PPRN. These widespread connections, and programs that span the translational spectrum, position Mayo Clinic CCaTS to become a true ?hub? for CTS. The present application builds on key accomplishments over the previous 5 years in each of the major areas relevant to the NCATS mission. Mayo CCaTS has mature, innovative programs in workforce development for all members of CTS teams and is diversifying them through online and experiential learning. Incentivizing Team Science has always been part of the institutional culture at Mayo, and we are continuing to build on that strength. Given its role, particularly in Rochester, as a major local and regional provider of health care, community engagement has also been a priority for Mayo Clinic, and a range of methods for bidirectional engagement are proposed. Advances in informatics are also enabling us to connect with new and diverse patient populations. Thus, in light of our institutional traditions and accomplishments over the past 5 years, we believe we are uniquely positioned to accomplish our Specific Aims: Aim 1. Train and maintain an outstanding multidisciplinary CTS workforce, including the entire spectrum of individuals involved in CTS; Aim 2. Eliminate barriers to the work of translation by streamlining methods and processes, including improved and innovative informatics tools, completing the transformation of Mayo's clinical trial process, and accelerating the implementation of trial results and other discoveries to improve patient care; Aim 3. Engage and incorporate a range of diverse stakeholders as active participants in CCaTS, both in leadership roles and in specific research projects, to improve the process of translation and the delivery of health care, promoting community engagement in research among our Mayo workforce and engaging our local and national communities using both traditional and innovative approaches; and Aim 4. Expand, strengthen, and streamline our regional and national collaborations in all aspects of CTS and education, connecting with our regional and national partners, as well as with the CTSA Consortium, to achieve the ultimate goal of NCATS to improve patient care and human health. Project Summary/Abstract Page 244 Contact PD/PI: Khosla, Sundeep The Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS) aims to catalyze the translation of research findings into clinically useful treatments and methods.

"9418804","The Southeast Partnership for Improving Research & Training in Cancer Health Disparities (SPIRIT- CHD) unites the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), an institution serving underserved populations and underrepresented students (ISUPS), and the NCI-designated Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) to advance translational research on the biological mechanisms of cancer health disparities focusing on biospecimen-based research and precision medicine. It also seeks to establish a joint cancer research education program focused on biobanking and precision medicine education. LSUHSC serves a region characterized by an underserved African-American population, and rampant cancer health disparities in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This region has several growing racial/ethnic minority populations. After Hurricane Katrina, the Hispanic population in Louisiana doubled and is now the fastest growing ethnic minority. MCC is located in Tampa, Florida and serves an increasingly wide catchment area characterized by a population diverse in regard to age, race/ethnicity, language and literacy, and is home to an increasing Latino population. Precision medicine research requires: a well-managed, ethnically and racially diverse biospecimen repository; state of the art technology in genomics, epigenomics and ancestry analysis; availability of language, cultural and literacy specific educational tools and resources; and a research education infrastructure that promotes a pipeline of trainees in cancer disparities research. MCC is a national leader and pioneer in these areas, has highly integrated research programs, and seeks to expand the diversity of their biospecimen research endeavors. This partnership is based on two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Plan and execute two collaborative pilot research projects. The first pilot research project focuses on breast cancer genomics, studying biospecimens from Hispanic/Latina patients of mixed genetic ancestry (African, Native American, European) by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and methylation analysis, to study correlations between molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles, clinical outcomes and ancestry. This project will support the career development of racial/ethnic minority early-stage investigators at LSUHSC and MCC. Specific Aim 2: Plan a collaborative three-pronged cancer research education program that includes: 1) a hands-on summer research experience for undergraduate and medical students; 2) delivery of a curriculum to those students focusing on biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities; and 3) expansion of outreach education to our respective communities about biobanking, precision medicine and cancer health disparities. The combination of these collaborative partnership activities is expected to offer mutual benefit to each institution to impact cancer health disparities, inspire the next generation of researchers, and rapidly lead to the submission of competitive grant applications. Importantly, our main collaborative goal is to bring the benefits of cancer research advancements to underserved communities."
"9569810","PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to ensure that the research conducted via the  Center for Disparities in Exposure and Health Effects of Multiple Environmental Stressors Across the  Life Course is informed by, responsive to, and ultimately serves individuals and communities most affected by  environmental health disparities. We will do this in partnership with two community organizations serving  residents in Chelsea and Boston, Massachusetts. Activities of the CEC will carry out its two overarching goals:  (1) Strengthen environmental health literacy by working with Center investigators, community organizations  and individual members of our target communities to create a mutual understanding of how scientific research  on daily exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution, combined with non-chemical stressors in the  neighborhood environment and within the home, contribute to environmental health disparities, and identify  opportunities for intervention and prevention; and (2) Facilitate communication between and among community  stakeholders and Center investigators, including for the purpose of training community partners in the design,  conduct, interpretation, evaluation and dissemination of research, and the associated products, within and  beyond the health-disparate communities most closely affiliated with our Center. Activities of the CEC are  focused on accomplishing: Aim 1: Design, implement and evaluate trainings for community residents recruited  to participate in Project 2 research by working with Project 2 investigators and CEC partners to develop  appropriate and effective recruitment strategies for residents of Chelsea and Dorchester. We will also design  and evaluate trainings for community investigators on our research aims, methods and in home-based  environmental monitoring which will inform future home-based environmental monitoring studies. Aim 2,  evaluate and inform Project 1 and 3 chemical and non-chemical stressor constructs, will be accomplished via  formal stakeholder focus groups in Chelsea and Dorchester during which candidate stressor constructs  identified by Project 3 investigators will be compared with stressor concerns of community members. We will  also organize community sessions to share results of cumulative risk models in Chelsea and Dorchester using  innovative and engaging communication methods which will also be evaluated for the risk communication  literature. Finally, Aim 3 will focus on the development of culturally appropriate educational materials that  translate the aims and findings of Projects 1-3, and Center pilot programs, to improve environmental health  literacy while reducing risk in and beyond the populations of Chelsea and Dorchester, Massachusetts. This will  involve close collaboration with Center investigators and CEC partners to develop materials that appropriately  communicate the aims and findings of Center studies to stakeholders, including partners associated with the  four cohort studies being leveraged in Project 1 (the CARDIA study and Children?s Health Watch sites)."
"9315587","The career development plan described in this application is an essential step in fulfilling the long-term goals of the applicant of developing novel therapeutics for Veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI)-mediated visual loss and cognitive dysfunctions and becoming an independent investigator in the VA system. The research objective of this proposal is to identify compounds that treat blast-induced central nervous system dysfunctions using a combination of molecular, electrophysiologic and pharmacologic tools. The experiments will be performed using a mouse model developed at the Iowa City Department of Veterans Affairs Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Visual Loss (CPTVL) that has an ocular phenotype (retinal ganglion cell damage), and neurological deficits (learning, memory and coordination problems) present in humans. Mild TBI generates abnormal neuronal activity in the mouse model. At molecular level, the abnormal neuronal function could be the result of changes in the receptors of the main inhibitory neurotransmitter ?- aminobutyric acid (GABA). The first aim is to identify molecular changes in the expression, composition and localization of GABAA receptors in the retina and the brain of mice exposed to blast. The second aim is to find therapeutic agents that mitigate the abnormal firing activity of retinal ganglion cells that we have discovered to occur following blast-induced mild TBI. Electrophysiologic and pharmacologic tools will be used to test the effects of GABAA receptor targeting pharmacologic agents on neuronal activity to establish if they can restore proper function after mild TBI. The GABAA receptors can be targeted by a wide variety of well-characterized therapeutic agents (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids and inhaled anesthetics) that modulate their function. By defining the molecular and functional changes in the GABAA receptors induced by blast-mediated TBI, drugs that can compensate for the alterations in the GABAergic system can be identified and tested. Normalizing the neuronal activity and preventing the death of neurons, which we assume, ultimately, occurs in neurons exhibiting abnormal firing patterns, will result in preserved visual and cognitive functions. To ensure the clinical applicability of the research performed and that the applicant learns the necessary tools and skills to perform basic research with strong implications for translation into clinical practice, one of the mentors is a practicing psychiatrist. The training and mentoring plans also include interactions with the CPTVL Investigators, including a neuro-ophthalmologist, the Director of our Center, and the scientists and medical doctors associated with The Wynn Institute for Vision Research and the Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science."
"9427058","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to combine empirical data with mechanistic physiologic knowledge to produce personalized, quantitative predictions that can lead to improved treatments. In normal practice, physicians reason by analogy from generic physiologic principles, but the technology exists to exploit even imperfect physiologic models make treatment personalized and quantitatively grounded in physiology, and to improve learning from empirical data. We will apply data assimilation (DA), mechanistic mathematical modeling, machine learning, and control theory, which have revolutionized space travel, weather forecasting, transportation and flight, and manufacturing. Data assimilation and control theory have seen very limited use in medicine, usually applied in data-rich circumstances like continuous glucose monitoring or packemakers. Our previous work demonstrated use of data assimilation with glucose-insulin models to predict glucose in the outpatient type 2 diabetes setting. We will extend data assimilation and control theory using, for example, a constrained ensemble Kalman filter and an offline Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to better handle sparse, short training sets on rapidly changing patients, and we will apply it in the setting of glucose management in the intensive care unit (ICU). Moreover, we will develop DA for phenotyping applications by exploiting the parameter estimation capabilities of DA. Data assimilation can be used to estimate measureable and unmeasureable physiologic states and parameters, and we will use these estimates to create higher definition phenotypes. While we are focusing on glucose management in the ICU, we will develop methods that are likely to generalize, beginning the effort to develop DA in the context of healthcare more broadly. The work we propose is a necessary step toward being able to use mechanism-driven DA to test, validate and optimize personalized short-term treatment strategies, long-term health forecasts, and mechanistic physiologic understanding. We will carry out the following aims: AIM 1?forecast?extend the DA methodology to allow forecasting, personalization, model evaluation, and model selection in the ICU context, relating treatment input to physiologic outcome; AIM 2?phenotype?extend the DA framework to state and parameter estimation to allow for mechanism-based phenotyping, careful uncertainty quantification, and inference of difficult or impossible-to-measure physiology; AIM 3?control?extend the DA to include a controller that begins with desired clinical outcomes, e.g., glucose range, and estimates the inputs, e.g., insulin or nutrition, required to achieve the outcomes."
"9436056","Project Summary  Acetaldehyde is both an exogenous carcinogen and endogenous metabolite. While acetaldehyde formed after consumption of alcoholic beverages is well-known as a hepatotoxin and contributor to the developmental abnormalities associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, endogenous production of acetaldehyde was only recently linked to the genetic disease, Fanconi anemia. Acetaldehyde forms DNA adducts, including interstrand DNA crosslinks, repaired by the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway. Alcohol metabolism also induces mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, as a cytoprotective mechanism. An entirely new function for Fanconi anemia/BRCA proteins in mitophagy was recently described, highlighting a potential role for the FA/BRCA in responding to acetaldehyde-induced cellular injury. Both Fanconi anemia and fetal alcohol syndrome are characterized by congenital anomalies, and Fanconi anemia and alcohol predispose to an overlapping collection of epithelial neoplasms.  Cellular sensitivity to acetaldehyde is poorly understood, and is likely affected by endogenous production of acetaldehyde, metabolism, generation of covalent DNA and protein adducts, and repair pathways. Nave and primed embryonic stem cells represent pre- and post-implantation pluripotent populations in the developing embryo. We demonstrate that nave embryonic stem cells are strikingly tolerant of 1 mM acetaldehyde, while primed embryonic stem cells are exquisitely sensitive (in fact, our collaborator, Dr. Carol Ware, uses acetaldehyde routinely to select against any primed cells that may arise during culture of nave embryonic stem cells). In preliminary data, we show that both types of embryonic stem cell generate acetaldehyde and exhibit basal levels of acetaldehyde adducts with DNA to different degrees. Surprisingly, resistance of nave embryonic stem cells to acetaldehyde is not diminished by inhibition of acetaldehyde-metabolizing aldehyde dehydrogenases.  In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms of differential acetaldehyde resistance in embryonic stem cells. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will utilize sensitive DNA adductomic profiling to examine the role of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA DNA repair pathway or mitochondrial DNA repair in acetaldehyde resistance. In Aim 2, we will investigate the regulation of the mitophagic response to acetaldehyde by the FA/BRCA pathway. Acetaldehyde inhibits sirtuin 3, the mitochondrial deacetylase, most likely by depleting its NAD+ substrate, leading to a hyperacetylated mitochondrial proteome. Acetylation inhibits mitophagy. We will determine whether the FA/BRCA pathway reduces mitochondrial protein acetylation, thus enabling quality control via mitophagy. The proposed research will generate important new information for understanding cellular responses to acetaldehyde, both in the context of alcohol consumption and genetic syndromes of acetaldehyde hypersensitivity."
"9394445","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects >10% of the adult US population, costs tens of billions of dollars annually, and can lead to progressive kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and early mortality. CKD is not a single entity but rather a heterogeneous condition with a wide spectrum of underlying causes, pathologic and clinical manifestations, and rates of progression. Because of the paucity of kidney biopsy samples from patients with common forms of CKD and the acknowledged limitations of animal models, our understanding of the pathology and molecular mechanisms of CKD is limited. Deeper understanding of human CKD will require investigation of kidney tissue from patients with CKD, using rapidly evolving techniques in molecular pathology. In this proposal we have established a multidisciplinary investigative team and outline plans for a multicenter CKD recruitment site for the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) [RFA-DK-16-026] involving Brigham and Women?s Hospital, Joslin Diabetes Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital. The proposal builds upon an established infrastructure, the Boston Kidney Biopsy Consortium (BKBC, R01DK093574) that has successfully enrolled, collected biospecimens, and longitudinally followed > 800 patients undergoing native kidney biopsy at the four institutions. We will share plasma, urine, DNA, RNA, and archival kidney tissue specimens from the BKBC with the KPMP in order to accelerate progress in the UG3 phase and beyond. We will also share samples from U01DK104308, a study that collects intraoperative kidney tissue samples from non-cancer cortex during nephrectomy for research in kidney fibrosis. For the UG3 phase we propose participating in collaborative discussions to define the scientific objectives and to address the ethics and safety of kidney biopsy in CKD. Pilot studies in the UG3 phase will include research biopsies in patients with CKD who do not typically undergo kidney biopsy, and research cores from patients undergoing clinically indicated biopsies for CKD. In the UH3 phase, we propose expanding the study to include larger numbers of research biopsies across different stages of CKD. We also propose biopsies in individuals with longstanding Type 1 diabetes mellitus with no evidence of kidney pathology, in order to identify molecular underpinnings of protection against diabetic kidney disease. We also outline a proposal for repeat biopsies in 10 participants with rapid annual loss of estimated GFR (>5 ml/min/year) and in 10 participants with no change in estimated GFR (<1ml/min/year). We are committed to collaborative protocol development, sharing best practices, and team science to achieve the KPMP?s objectives of advancing precision medicine to improve the lives of our patients with and at risk for CKD. The proposed research plan, by improving our understanding of CKD pathophysiology, has the potential to dramatically impact public health."

"9383273","The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (Btz), carfilzomib (Cfz) and ixazomib (Ixz) are successfully used for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), but lack clinical efficacy against solid tumors despite demonstrating significant activity in tissue culture and animal models. In an effort to understand this discrepancy, we decided to focus on triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), a genetically diverse group that lacks targeted treatments. TNBCs overexpress pro-apoptotic protein NOXA, which plays a key role in proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis, and are proteasome-addicted. The proteasome has three pairs of active sites: 5, 1, and 2. The primary target of Btz and Cfz are the 5 sites. At concentrations of Btz and Cfz that induce apoptosis in TNBC in culture, co-inhibition of either 1 or 2 is also observed. These concentrations exceed clinically relevant concentrations, potentially explaining why proteasome inhibitors have no in vivo activity in solid tumors, and suggesting that stronger co-inhibition of either 1 or 2 would improve in vivo activity. It is not known whether the 2 or the 1 site is a better target. We developed specific inhibitors of the 1 and 2 sites and CRISPR- generated mutations of these sites. We found that LU-102 and mutations in the 2 sites are much stronger sensitizers of TNBC cells to Cfz and Btz than the 1 inhibitor NC-021 or 1 mutations; 2 mutations sensitize orthotopic xenografts of TNBC cells to sub-toxic doses of Cfz. LU-102 and 2 mutations block recovery of proteasome activity in Cfz-treated cells. In contrast to myeloma cells, proteasome activity recovers in TNBC cells treated with clinically relevant concentrations of Cfz. We found that LU-102 and 2 mutations inhibit recovery of proteasome activity by causing aggregation of Nrf1 (NFE2L1/TCF11), a transcription factor that up- regulates proteasome genes expression in cells treated with 5 inhibitors. NC-021 and 1 mutations do not block recovery of proteasome activity. Therefore, we hypothesize that 2 inhibitors will sensitize TNBCs to FDA-approved 5 inhibitors, by the mechanism which involves tumor-specific inhibition of Nrf1-mediated recovery of proteasome activity. We further hypothesize that targeting enzymes involved in Nrf1 activation will also sensitize TNBC to proteasome inhibitors. The specific aims of this proposal are: (i) to determine whether 2 inhibitors sensitize TNBC to Cfz, Btz, and Ixz in vivo; (ii) to determine whether 2 inhibitors block recovery of proteasome activity in a tumor-specific fashion in vivo and determine whether alternative approaches to target this recovery sensitize tumors to FDA-approved inhibitors. Accomplishing these aims will demonstrate that the 2 sites and Nrf1 are effective drug targets in TNBC, establish the mechanism of action of 2 inhibitors, pave the road to clinical trials of 2 inhibitors in TNBC, and launch future work in solid tumors of different organs."
"9357401","Project Summary  It has been estimated that 1.4 million people in the United States suffer from Lewy body dementia (LBD), including both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Patients with LBD suffer from cognitive decline, sometimes linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the motor and behavioral changes seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of LBD can be difficult, particularly in those DLB patients that present with cognitive impairment prior to motor or marked behavioral changes. Biomarkers for LBD are few and their value in diagnosis, prognosis, and for treatment response is limited.  Impediments to biomarker development in LBD have included small subject numbers, a lack of systematic patient characterization, and a failure to perform longitudinal follow up with autopsy. Both AD and PD have benefited from a number of large ?consortiums? that have advanced research by leveraging the strengths of several groups of research centers to combine efforts with standardized approaches to the study of the disease. One good example is the Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) program, funded by the National Institute on Aging, where over 30 research centers across the United States have agreed to a standardized approach to the diagnosis and characterization of patients with AD. Other similar programs include the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP), and the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). Fortunately, the latter two PD programs have included more systematic clinical assessments and collection of biofluids and imaging data relevant to cognition in PD. Recently, a pathology component has been added to the PPMI project. No similar program exists for DLB.  The objective of this proposal is to establish a consortium of centers for the study of DLB with a large number of subject enrolled, systematic assessments (compatible with AD and PD programs), collection of biofluids and imaging data, and ultimately autopsy. The DLB consortium (DLBC) would create the necessary foundation for biomarker development and have the secondary benefit of creating an ongoing subject sample available for additional translational and therapeutic studies. We have brought together nine centers with expertise in the Lewy body disorders and with strong connections to the Lewy body dementia research and general community to participate in the DLBC. This group of investigators has collaborated extensively together for many years and will provide the foundation for this much needed resource."
"9328073","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a group of disorders encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. As such, IBD represents one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal diseases in the US, costing approximately $1.7 billion annually. Because IBD is incurable, patients are forced to endure repeated hospitalizations and surgeries. Moreover, since IBD disproportionately impacts people of low socio-economic status, the cost burden of IBD falls most heavily on those most susceptible to financial hardship. Extensive research into the genetics of IBD over the last several decades led to the development of several animal models for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. By comparison, the study of environmental risk factors like diet has accelerated to equivalent levels only in the last few years. Indeed, while a Western diet low in fiber and high in fat has long been correlated with development of IBD, it was only recently shown that low dietary fiber exacerbates IBD. Studies of other dietary factors, including salt, remain to be performed. We specifically propose to examine the role of a high-salt diet (HSD). Recent studies show that dietary salt can exacerbate autoimmune encephalitis, suggesting that a HSD could contribute to other auto-immune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Indeed, in preliminary experiments, we have observed that animals on a HSD display exacerbated inflammation and increased inflammatory cytokine production in two models of murine colitis: the Il10-/- model of inflammatory colitis, and the S. typhimurium model of infectious colitis. Our data thus indicates that a HSD can exacerbate intestinal inflammation in mice. Based on these data, we propose to examine the role of the innate immune system in HSD- exacerbated colitis, as well as the involvement of the serum and glucocorticoid kinase (SGK1) which has previously been described as an osmosensor in Th17 cells. We specifically hypothesize that innate immune cells respond to dietary salt, increasing their inflammatory output in these models of colitis. To address this hypothesis, we will examine T cell deficient (Rag knockout) mice in both models, and compare histology, cytokine expression and cellular recruitment on a HSD vs a LSD. (AIM 1). We will also specifically examine the role of SGK1 in innate cells using a small molecule inhibitor, and genetic knockout mice. (AIM 2). The implications of this proposal are far reaching. In determining how dietary salt drives IBD, our research may suggest potential drug targets (e.g. signaling pathways responsible for enhanced immune activation), or prophylactic dietary guidelines (i.e. low-salt diets for people with IBD). The latter public health approach is particularly important, as dietary guidelines are inexpensive and can be implemented immediately to provide relief to those suffering with IBD."
"9415526","DESCRIPTION. A high-density Stim-Grid MAP spinal cord stimulation lead technology is proposed to enable the creation of predictive maps that detail how lower urinary tract nerve pathways can be activated through high- density stimulation of the sacral spinal cord and roots. These maps will enable principled development of neuromodulation therapies that use spinal cord stimulation to alleviate the burden of overactive bladder and incontinence. The lower urinary tract (LUT), consisting of the bladder, urethra and associated muscles and nerves, is an important target organ system for neuromodulation therapies as injury, disease and aging can lead to impairment and subsequent reductions in the quality of life. While existing neuromodulation devices have been implanted in over 200,000 people, device related adverse events remain common, and despite functional improvements, many people still deal with unwanted symptoms of overactive bladder and incontinence. Using electric field modelling, our multidisciplinary team has demonstrated that a two-fold increase in electrode columns and density can deliver stimulation to laterally-positioned spinal cord targets not possible with existing clinical electrodes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated feasibility of manufacturing ultra-flexible electrodes that can conform to the plexus geometry of the sacral spinal cord. The objective of this technology development effort is to develop and commercialize a 64-channel active-lead which contains 8-columns and 8 rows, and to develop maps of the accessibility of LUT peripheral nerves through spinal cord stimulation. We seek to perform three development tasks: (AIM 1) Develop a contoured and passive high-density epidural spinal-cord paddle array, (AIM 2): Develop a STIM-GRID MAP spinal cord paddle with a switch-matrix electronics package, (AIM 3) Develop maps of LUT recruitment by high-resolution stimulation of the sacral spinal cord. Our multi-disciplinary team includes device development (Micro-Leads) and bladder electrophysiology (University of Pittsburgh). In Year 1 we will create and demonstrate a 48-channel flexible and high-density passive lead and create maps that describe the selective access to the pelvic nerve, pudendal nerve and pudendal nerve branches. In Year 2 we will demonstrate a Stim-Grid MAP array with 8 columns and 8-rows (64-channels of resolution) using only 16 wires. The high-resolution array will enable us to generate maps of LUT peripheral nerve access at the spinal cord, but importantly, is immediately scalable to map other organ models with little additional development effort and time. Because the Stim-Grid MAP technology is based on well-understood implantable spinal cord lead implantation techniques, this technology could be rapidly translated to high-resolution spinal cord mapping experiments in people during an intraoperative settings in an OT3 phase."
"9562259","Abstract: FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening  Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last decade mainly through the various modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer (FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more than 20,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 3000 times. FS is part of the analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Frammingham Heart Study (FHS). One third of all ADNI-based publications cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS.  Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1- weighted MRI images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, EEG/MEG. FS provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (eg, SPM, FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.  A software package with a scientific breadth and user based the size of FS?s requires a significant amount of effort just to maintain it. For example, the FS email list receives approximately 3000 posts a year. FS must be continuously and rigorously tested because it is such an integral part of the neuroimaging infrastructure. Users are constantly requesting new functionality and better performance. This proposal will be used to develop, maintain, and harden FS. Specifically, we will make FS more robust by incorporating multiple modalities instead of just T1. We will replace the whole-brain segmentation with an unsupervised method that simultaneously optimizes bias field correction in a multimodal setting. We will implements multivariate analysis tools to assist in the interpretation of data. We will also harden and optimize the FS code base. Finally, we will include tools to assist the user to easily find where the FS analysis fails."
"9479909","Project 1 Microbiology of ME/CFS Abstract Many patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) report a prodrome consistent with infection and/or inflammation. Up to 40% of patients are reported to respond to intravenous infusions of the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, Ampligen, a double-stranded RNA analogue proposed to inhibit viral replication. Others report responses to antiviral drugs specific for herpesviruses, pre- and probiotics or fecal transplantation, or monoclonal antibodies that deplete B cells. We hypothesize that at least some ME/CFS patients have an infectious trigger for their disease, and that failures to implicate infectious agents reflect inadequate sampling and/or inappropriate assays. To explore the role of infection and immunity in ME/CFS, we will exploit sensitive sequence-based methods for detection and characterization of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, using blood, oral, and fecal samples from well characterized ME/CFS cases and controls. This project has the potential to lead to the development of animal models based on dysbiosis as well as the identification of patients with ME/CFS who may benefit from antiviral, antibiotic, or probiotic interventions."
"9432207","PROJECT SUMMARY Sleep is a fundamental biological process that is essential for survival. Sleep abnormalities not only affect daily performance but also contribute to various diseases, including cognitive disorders and cardiovascular diseases. It is estimated that 50-70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep loss and other sleep disorders, such as insomnia. However, effective treatments for sleep disorders are limited. Thus, it is imperative to understand the genetic basis, neural circuits and functions of sleep. Recent studies suggest that sleep is an evolutionarily conserved process, with shared features across different organisms that include behavioral quiescence, increased arousal threshold, and rapid reversibility to wakefulness. To understand the conserved mechanisms underlying sleep regulation and function, I will study a robust sleep model (EGF-induced sleep in C. elegans) that we have generated. It has been shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling promotes sleep in worms, flies, fish and mammals. In C. elegans, transient activation of EGF signaling in the neuroendocrine cell (ALA) promotes a sleep-like state. My preliminary data shows that transcriptional changes occur during EGF-induced sleep. However, the identities of sleep-promoting neurons downstream of ALA and the molecular mechanisms underlying the impacts of EGF-induced sleep on the worm?s physiology are still unknown. I hypothesize that ALA coordinates downstream sleep control center(s) to drive a sleep state, which induces transcriptional changes to impact physiology. To facilitate the identification of these downstream sleep-promoting neurons, I have developed a new bipartite expression system, called cGAL, for spatiotemporal control of transgene expression in C. elegans, similar to the GAL4-UAS system for Drosophila. With this new genetic tool, I propose to: 1) Identify the neural circuits underlying EGF-induced sleep; 2) Refine cGAL for better spatial and temporal control of transgene expression in C. elegans; 3) Determine transcriptional changes during EGF-induced sleep. To achieve these aims, I need additional scientific and technical training on RNA-seq, bioinformatics, optogenetics, microscopy and circuit mapping the bipartite cGAL system. The K99/R00 award will allow me to acquire these skills with the guidance from my mentors (Dr. Paul Sternberg and Dr. David Prober) and my advisory committee (Dr. Barbara Wold, Dr. David Anderson, Dr. Viviana Gradinanu, Dr. Andres Collazo and Dr. Igor Antoshechkin).The results of this proposal will provide a framework for my future career to focus on the study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sleep regulation and function in my own laboratory. My study will advance our understanding of the biology of sleep, which may ultimately contribute to the development of effective treatments for sleep disorders. In addition, this project will also provide the C. elegans community with a fully functional bipartite expression system through a valuable set of cGAL reagents, which will allow other researchers to dissect the neural circuits for other complex behaviors in C. elegans."
"9351519","PROJECTI SUMMARY Project 1: Structural Analysis of HIV Entry Inhibition Our overall objective is to provide an atomic-level understanding of opportunities for intervention in processes of cell entry by HIV. We plan to continue our structural studies on HIV gpl20 in the context of this program project on antagonism of HIV envelope function in cell entry. Our technical focus is on x-ray crystallography, so as to determine structures at sufficient resolution to develop mechanistic insights, but associated binding experiments and computations will also be performed. Our aims include using crystal structure to screen for new lead compounds, structural analyses of complexes of HIV gp120 with candidate inhibitory molecules, structural studies of HIV gpl20 interactions with other natural binding partners besides CD4, and innovative computational analyses of gp 120 plasticity. We build not only on our recent experience in this project, but also on our earlier structural investigations of CD4, HIV gp120s, and associated antibodies. We have adopted or developed both appropriate expression systems for making the required proteins and also appropriate assays for following inhibitory action. We interact with all other elements of the program project: most intimately with Project 3 on chemistry (Smith) and Project 5 on virology (Sodroski), but also significantly with Project 2 on peptidomimetics and miniproteins (Chaiken), Project 4 on thermodynamics (Freire), prospectively with Project 6 on dynamics by single-molecule FRET (Mothes), and importantly with the computation core (LaLonde)."
"9502694","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macrophages (M) are among the immune system's most important defenders of the body by protecting against infection and injury but they also accelerate numerous diseases. Recent studies indicate that many tissue M are generated during embryonic development and maintain themselves in adults in the steady-state. In diseased tissues, however, many M originate from circulating monocytes (Mo). For example, we found that circulating Mo often in?ltrate the ischemic myocardium, atherosclerotic plaques and growing tumors, where they differentiate into M and can promote disease. These circulating Mo can be released in large quantities from different reservoir locations, including th bone marrow and spleen, and various diseases enhance Mo production in these reservoirs by amplifying hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) locally. At present, an accurate understanding of disease-induced M responses is lacking and requires a more comprehensive analysis of the origins and dynamics of these cells at the organismal level. The research proposed in this application will de?ne both the quantity and quality of tissue M based on thei origins. We propose that, in disease, distinct anatomical sites produce different types of M precursors and we will thus test the hypothesis that disease-associated tissue M responses can be tailored by manipulating these cells' topo-ontogenic sources. First, by taking the entire HSPC?Mo?M lineage into account we will identify the most important kinetic processes that de?ne the quantity of disease-associated M (aim 1). Second, by considering the different origins of these M we will uncover maturational pathways that in?uence their quality in vivo (aim 2). Our ?ndings have therapeutic potential because in both aims we will de?ne how Ang II pathway manipulations control M. Ang II is a newly identi?ed driver of HSPC/Mo/M-mediated in?ammation that is active in a variety of diseases (cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction) and can be targeted with FDA-approved drugs. Our goal is to develop new advances that can be used to restrain unwanted in?ammatory reactions or instead promote delivery of protective immunity to tissue. Our experiments will use the so-called KP tumor mouse model because we have generated data indicating that: i) M in KP tumors have a dominant phenotype and promote disease; ii) many of these M originate from HSPC and Mo that are produced in bone marrow and spleen; iii) HSPC?Mo?M lineage ampli?cation in KP mice resembles the one observed in other disease models including myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis; and iv) the hormone Angiotensin (Ang) II ampli?es disease-promoting M in KP mice. Also, we have assembled a team of experts in imaging, leukocyte traf?cking, data modeling and integrative biology to accomplish our goals."
"9358861","ABSTRACT  The Biostatistics and Data Management Core provides a broad array of statistical services in support of the four projects. The Core will provide advice on clinical trial design - such as selection of end points and possible stratification, consideration and calculation of sample size and statistical power. The Core is responsible for all aspects of data management in all four projects in this proposed Program Project (P01), ?Consortium on Methods Evaluating Tobacco (COMET): Filter Ventilation and Product Standards?; we use secure databases with strong emphasis on data integrity and data quality. The Core will form plans and perform expert statistical analyses in a standardized format consistent between Projects using techniques that are state of the art. The Core will also facilitate data sharing between projects in the Center as well as the general scientific community.  The Core is staffed by a biostatistician serving as Protocol Manager (Data Manager) and four highly experienced biostatisticians who have daily working relationships with all principal investigators; two of the four biostatisticians are senior faculty (Associate Professors) of the Division of Biostatistics. The Core biostatisticians have been an integral part in the development of this application and have participated with this productive group of investigators the last 4-5 years of this current COMET grant. Additionally, the Core includes one biostatistician and one bioinformaticians at The Ohio State University who will focus on conducting studies involving complex multi-dimensional datasets.  The primary objective of the Biostatistics and Data Management Core is to contribute to the science and operation of the program project by participating fully in its activities. Core biostatisticians have broad long- standing expertise in clinical trial design, data collection, data storage, data retrieval, data analysis, and interpretation of results incorporating novel and complex statistical procedures as needed. By providing expertise research methodology and logistical support to data analytic activities with all three projects, this Core will help to enhance data interpretation and scientific productivity."
"9479860","PROJECT SUMMARY ? CLINICAL CORE The function of the Clinical Core is to recruit and screen patient candidates and control subjects and to fully characterize ME/CFS patients and well-matched control subjects (e.g., medical history, ME/CFS Common Data Elements, etc.). A hallmark symptom of ME/CFS is post-exertional malaise (PEM), or the exacerbation of a patient's symptom complex following exertion beyond their unique threshold. The Clinical Core will obtain physiological data to establish the functional status of both patients and controls using the two-CPET protocol to assess the effects of PEM on functional capacity. The increase of ME/CFS symptoms by a standardized exercise stressor provides researchers with a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of PEM on a patient's ability to produce energy to do work. This requires two sequential exercise stressors using cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) to first measure baseline functional capacity (maximum energy production) and to exacerbate PEM symptoms, and a second test 24 hours later to measure the effects of exertion on energy production. Physiological data obtained from the CPET will be utilized by the Research Projects and the Integrative Data Analysis Core to examine correlations with results of neuroimaging scans from Project 1, extracellular vesicle content, inflammatory markers and metabolite profiling from Project 2, and gene expression in immune cells from Project 3. The Clinical Core will facilitate sharing of physiological data to the Integrative Data Analysis Core to allow the comprehensive analysis of data from the Clinical Core in conjunction with other data acquired in the Research Projects. The Clinical Core will oversee testing of patients and controls at three different sites in two states (New York, California), which differ in demographics and environmental factors. Subjects will be located in two urban but distinctly different environments (greater New York City and Los Angeles) and in the rural areas of central and Western New York State. Studying patients from different environments will enhance our efforts to recruit a relatively diverse sample and probe site- specific or environment effects as etiologic factors of ME/CFS."
"9358857","ABSTRACT Cigarette filter ventilation is a major design feature of the majority of cigarettes sold in the United States and abroad. Although filter ventilation was initially intended to produce a lighter tasting and potentially safer cigarette by diluting mainstream cigarette smoke, data have since suggested that ventilation instead increases total harm from smoking by inducing compensatory smoking (e.g., increased puff volume and/or more cigarettes smoked per day due to reduced nicotine yields) and may increase cigarette abuse liability (addictive potential). The goal of this project is to use the recently developed Experimental Tobacco Marketplace to assess the effects of removing filter ventilation, thereby modeling a regulatory environment in which filter ventilation was banned, on behavioral economic measures of abuse liability. In a series of studies featuring both between- and within-subject design components, the research team will compare purchasing and consumption of unventilated and ventilated cigarettes across a broad range of prices, as well as examine how filter ventilation impacts the degree to which an array of alternative nicotine delivery systems (e.g., electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco) serve as economic substitutes for cigarettes. Moreover, we will model electronic cigarette regulatory restrictions on flavor and available nicotine concentrations to examine how such restrictions interact with cigarette filter ventilation to affect tobacco consumption. Together, the findings from this project could be used to inform and maximize the efficacy of regulatory action regarding cigarette filter ventilation and alternative nicotine delivery systems."
"9567678","Lead Development and Optimization Shared Resource ? Project Summary The Lead Development and Optimization Shared Resource (LDOSR) is a University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) shared resource composed of three functions: 1) High Throughput Screening (HTS); 2) Medicinal Chemistry (MC); and 3) the Biotechnology, Innovation and Optimization Center (BIOC). Collectively, these three functions allow the LDOSR to accelerate projects from early method development around cancer pathways or targets, through high throughput screening, compound hit prioritization, secondary in vitro confirmatory assays, medicinal chemistry optimization, in vitro pharmacology testing, in vivo pharmacokinetics and drug delivery formulations for in vivo preclinical proof-of-concept testing. The LDOSR has modified its composition and activities over the past four years in order to provide the best possible support to KUCC members. The Preclinical Proof of Concept (PPOC) service was eliminated from the LDOSR at the end of 2012 because many KUCC members had similar functionality within their own laboratories. Furthermore, it was realized that the LDOSR would be enhanced by a dedicated medicinal chemistry expert. Therefore, Frank Schoenen joined the LDOSR to provide medicinal chemistry optimization services. In 2014, the LDOSR formed a project management service known as the Target Acceleration Group (TAG). TAG aims to accelerate projects from early method development around cancer pathways or targets and more seamlessly move projects between HTS, Medicinal Chemistry and the BIOC. TAG helps KUCC members navigate the drug discovery, delivery and development process more efficiently."
"9356671","Abstract: Inappropriate expression of genes such as the homeotic (HOX) genes is found in up to 40% of cases of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Two well-known genetic subsets, those with MLL-rearrangements and those with NPM1 mutations, are known to possess high-level expression of HOX genes and have been shown to be dependent on continued expression of these genes. Recent studies have defined the protein complexes that maintain this aberrant gene expression. Furthermore, multiple groups and pharma/biotech companies have now developed small molecule inhibitors of these complexes. Some of these small molecules, particularly those targeting DOT1L, EZH2 and Bromodomains) have recently entered early phase trials and have shown interesting biological and some complete clinical responses. Another approach to target chromatin associated complexes is inhibition of the MLL1-Menin interaction, an approach that has also been shown to reverse HOX gene expression. In this proposal we will characterize newly developed MLL1-Menin inhibitors and work to bring one of these small molecules to clinical assessment. In Specific Aim 1 we will characterize the effects on gene expression and chromatin state after inhibition of the MLL1-Menin interaction in MLL-rearranged and NPM1 mutant AML cells. In Specific Aim 2 we will assess the combination of MLL1-Menin inhibitors with either azacitidine, DOT1L inhibitors or FLT3 inhibitors. In Specific Aim 3 we will initiate a phase 1 trial of MLL-1 Menin inhibitors alone and in combination with a azacitidine. These trials that will set the foundation for further assessment of combinations based on results from preclinical studies described here. The proposed experiments will propel MLL1-Menin inhibitors to clinical assessment and importantly define combination approaches that should be assessed in future clinical studies."
"9551793","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The neonatal crystallizable fragment (Fc) receptor (FcRn) is widely expressed throughout life in hematopoietic cells. In antigen presenting cells (APC), FcRn functions to protect monomeric IgG from degradation and regu- late innate and adaptive immune responses to IgG as an immune complex (IC). The current research proposal addresses the unanswered question of how FcRn functions as a signaling receptor in the context of IgG IC and in cooperation with Fc? receptors (Fc?R). Our long-term goals are to identify the mechanisms by which FcRn mediates intracellular signaling from an endosomal platform, reveal how these activities overlap with and in- volve interactions with Fc?R through a focus on a genetically relevant isoform of Fc?R, Fc?R2a (CD32A), and demonstrate that FcRn interactions with CD32A are genotypically distinct with important functional implications by studies in humanized animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this research is to determine how FcRn affects the outcome of IgG IC responses and association with intestinal inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that Fc?R and FcRn functions are integrated as proximal and distal coordinators, re- spectively, of innate and adaptive responses to IgG IC. In this relationship, FcRn functions as a signaling re- ceptor and acts as a major downstream mediator and core regulator of proximal Fc?R function.The rationale is derived from our demonstration that FcRn determines the levels of interleukin-12 produced by DC and the an- tigen processing and presentation associated with MHC class I-associated cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells and MHC class II-associated presentation to CD4+ T cells in response to IgG IC which critically influences mu- cosal homeostasis, intestinal inflammation in response to bacterial antigens and immune-surveillance against colorectal cancer. Our central hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Define the signaling path- ways associated with FcRn-dependent interactions with IgG IC in APC; 2) Demonstrate the functional interde- pendence between Fc?R and FcRn in innate and adaptive immunity, and; 3) Determine whether FcRn controls Fc?R polymorphic responses to IgG-driven inflammation in vivo. In Aim 1, we will use information from a prote- omic assessment of FcRn-bearing intracellular endosomes to determine the specific signaling pathways that FcRn influences in APC and their specific relationships with innate and adaptive immune responses. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that FcRn regulates CD32A which is unique to humans and associated with IBD, and de- fine the mechanism of this interaction. In Aim 3, we will determine whether FcRn controls innate and adaptive inflammation in vivo associated with different CD32A genotypes. Overall, this proposal is significant because it will increase our understanding of FcRn function within APC in coordinating mucosal immune responses and how they cooperate with Fc?R and in so doing broadly extend the implications of FcRn function. In light of re- cent efforts to inhibit FcRn-IgG interactions for the treatment of IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases our results will have important implications for the therapy of IBD and their application."
"9278359","ABSTRACT The underrepresentation of minorities in basic, clinical and behavioral research has been viewed as a significant barrier to addressing cancer disparities, and the inclusion of minority populations in clinical trials. Thus, there is a need to develop a cadre of racially and ethnically diverse, well-trained scientists. In this application, we will address the following barriers that underrepresented minorities face for a comprehensive rigorous, and innovative approach that will create opportunities and promote careers in cancer research for underrepresented minority researchers and students: (i) the lack of committed role models, (ii) inadequate mentoring, (iii) insufficient preparation, (iv) low expectations, and (v) not being aware of the culture and idioms of science. To achieve our long-term goal of increasing the pool of underrepresented minority (URM) cancer researchers, our primary objective is to augment, promote and sustain an independent, competitive cancer research training program that creates opportunities and promotes careers in oncology for minority students through the Comprehensive Research Training Opportunities for Outstanding Leaders (C-ReTOOL) program. This program will apprise and culturally sensitize undergraduate and graduate students of the need to reduce the disproportionate cancer burden in minority populations through basic, clinical, and behavioral research conducted in the US, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. The C-ReTOOL program will build on our existing cancer research and training opportunities to grow the number of underrepresented scientists and clinical investigators in higher education and academic leadership."
"9536434","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     PROJECT ABSTRACT : Management of localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with radical cystectomy is associated with risk of significant morbidity, perioperative mortality, and decreased quality of life- especially among the growing number of elderly. A less invasive and morbid, but equally effective means of treatment is needed. Multi-modal treatment of MIBC (maximal trans-urethral resection, followed by combined chemo and radiotherapy) is, for well-selected patients, associated with survival outcomes comparable to cystectomy and lower morbidity and mortality, but also offers bladder preservation. However, in the U.S., multi-modal therapy is not common for 3 reasons: First, there is uncertainty among referring urologists as to whether all tumor is visible at time of resection. Second, no currently available radiographic technologies allow reliable visualization of the bladder tumor site and its margins. Furthermore, the bladder is a deformable, mobile structure, whose location, size and shape vary depending on bladder and bowel fullness. This makes it very possible that the whole bladder and tumor site are not consistently treated, and that collateral radiation occurs. Third, we lack a non-invasive (e.g. imaging-based) means by which to assess for local control after treatment. Emerging data suggests that multi-parametric diffusion- weighted and contrast enhanced MRI can detect occult disease, but this has not been robustly validated because imaging findings, to date, could not be definitively correlated with histology of the same bladder site. We describe a means to reliably mark the bladder margins and tumor site to resolve these limitations of multi-modal therapy. To date, no means of marking the bladder walls has proven effective and reliable. We developed a novel fiducial marker design and placement protocol, initially to simply improve targeting of the tumor-site with high-dose radiotherapy. These ultra-small 24K gold markers are placed endoscopically in submucosa around the tumor site at time of pre-treatment maximal resection, and, at the anatomic boundaries of the bladder, to optimize image-guided bladder radiotherapy. To date, we have placed our markers into 32 patients with MIBC at UCSF. They are visible with any imaging modality, including all on- table imaging. They are safe and easy to place, appear not to migrate, and are durable. We propose that our fiducial markers serve to increase high-dose radiotherapy targeting accuracy and lower collateral radiation. The goals of the work proposed here are to (1.) Assess the efficacy, treatment benefit, and generalizability of our markers and placement technique among a larger sample of patients with MIBC; 2. Use our fiducial markers to assess the degree to which urologists may miss occult tumor outside of the main resection area; and 3. Use our markers to assess the positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) of diffusion-MRI to detect occult tumor pre and post-treatment. To accomplish these goals, we will perform 2 separate but complementary studies at UCSF--one in collaboration with Harvard/MGH."

"9442465","7. PROJECT SUMMARY  The production of functional gametes is of central importance to the survival of all sexually reproducing species. Our goal is to identify the microRNAs that function to control the essential process of spermatogenesis in C. elegans. microRNAs are indispensable regulators of gene expression that are required for animal development and physiology. microRNAs have been found to be misregulated in patients with male factor infertility as well as in testicular germ cell tumors. However, the specific pathways and targets regulated by individual microRNAs in the process of spermatogenesis remain largely unknown. The study of microRNAs in C. elegans has been instrumental in defining the core principles of individual microRNA regulation of targets in developmental pathways. This work will provide new insights into the principles of microRNA function in regulatory networks that function in the process of spermatogenesis.  microRNAs are required for mammalian spermatogenesis but their role in C. elegans spermatogenesis remains uncharacterized. This work will address three central questions: 1) What specific events of spermatogenesis require microRNAs? 2) What individual microRNAs function are expressed in the male gonad and function to regulate spermatogenesis? and 3) What pathways and direct targets are regulated the mir-44 family of microRNAs? This work will identify specific defects in spermatogenesis, pathways, and direct targets regulated by the mir-44 family. This work will provide a resource for future investigation to comprehensively define the functions of the subset of microRNAs that act in the male germ line to regulate the process of spermatogenesis."
"9354175","Overall AACORT Abstract The Alopecia Areata Center of Research Translation (AACORT) at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) is focused on the singular goal of developing new treatments for alopecia areata (AA). The mission of the AACORT is to leverage our recent discoveries beginning to unravel the genetic basis of AA and the fact that its pathogenesis is linked to dysregulation of both innate and acquired immunity, and to synergize these findings into translational studies that will lead to novel therapies for this disease, including the repurposing of existing drugs. In the past few years, the AACORT team has made transformative progress in understanding the genetic basis of AA, as well as initiating a series of clinical trials employing mechanism-driven targeted JAK inhibitors aimed at reversing the disease. While this class of drugs is having a profound impact on guiding clinical development efforts in AA, there is much more work to be done, since clearly many patients do not respond to these drugs. The goal of this AACORT is to build upon our established translational pipeline to leverage our basic and preclinical discoveries into the clinical setting. This AACORT is centered around a central Research Project that focuses on the Translational Science of Alopecia Areata, and deals with innovative translational aspects of the disease, including initiating factors such as the microbiome; preclinical studies focused on antigen discovery and testing new therapeutic approaches in vitro and in vivo; and clinical correlative studies designed to rigorously assess the efficacy and safety of new drugs coming available for patients with AA. The Research Project is supported by the Translational and Clinical Resource Core (TRAC), and the Data Analysis and Translational Applications (DATA) Core, which bring together an outstanding cadre of talented, committed and scientifically diverse faculty from across the institution. The AACORT is supported by a highly capable and experienced Administrative Core that provides its vitally important organizational infrastructure. The goal of the AACORT is to surmount barriers to translational application of basic discoveries that have the potential to revolutionize the management of this heretofore intractable and debilitating disorder."
"9246674","Equal segregation of the replicated genome during cell division is essential for the development and propagation of all living organisms. Errors in mitotic processes are a hallmark of cancer cells and major chemotherapeutics target the mitotic spindle. One critical function of the kinetochore is to generate the spindle checkpoint signal until each kinetochore has properly attached to microtubules. This signal is initiated by the localization of the MPS1 protein to the calponin homology domain of the Ndc80 complex, which is regulated by Aurora B. However, this domain of Ndc80 protrudes on a long coiled coil far from Aurora kinase, making it unclear how it could be phosphorylated. We have employed a vastly improved super-resolution microscope to visualize human kinetochores. This microscopes unique ability to provide super-resolution in the Z-plane is essential for the study of cellular structure the size of a kinetochore. This visualization of single molecules of Ndc80 in unattached kinetochores has identified a novel pool of the MPS1 binding region of the Ndc80 complex in the central region of spindle checkpoint signaling kinetochores. We hypothesize that this internal pool is a more efficient generator of the spindle checkpoint than the previously appreciated outer pools. We are employing super-resolution microscopy to both test this hypothesis and further map the sub-kinetochore location of key events in generating the spindle checkpoint signals. We will also identify how the spindle checkpoint is turned off by when kinetochores attach to microtubules. We are building upon two important new discoveries about the Ska complex. First, we have identified the steps that enable Ska to be recruited to kinetochores after microtubule attachments. Second, we have shown that Ska binds PP1 providing a mechanism to specifically recruit a phosphatase to properly attached kinetochores. Building upon this strong foundation we will determine how the Ndc80, Ska and PP1 proteins turn off the spindle checkpoint and generate the kinetochore microtubule attachment that allows kinetochores to remain bound to depolymerizing microtubules to move chromosomes."
"9561181","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Molecular and Cellular Cancer Biology Program (MCCBP), a basic research program, is to gain new insight into the molecular and cellular basis of cancer development and progression that can eventually be translated into the development of novel biomarkers of progression and treatment regimens. MCCBP research activities fall under three central themes: 1) genome stability; 2) signal transduction; and 3) mitochondria and metabolism. Specific aims of the MCCBP are to: 1) elucidate mechanisms of genome instability; 2) understand aberrant signal transduction in tumor cells; 3) investigate bioenergetic alterations and loss of apoptotic signaling in tumor cells; and 4) provide capacity building in support of the three research themes. Through collaboration and communication with other UPCI programs and translational disease-site groups, novel research findings by MCCBP investigators are translated into promising clinical applications, including the development of new targeted therapies and identification and validation of biomarkers. During the last funding cycle, the Program has lost 15 members but has added additional investigators and has grown by about 71% from 39 to 55 actively participating members, representing 17 departments and three schools at the University of Pittsburgh and one at Carnegie Mellon University. New members have been strategically added each year. Currently, MCCBP members receive over $9.8 M annually in direct funding, including $4.1 M from the NCI and $5.1 M in other peer-reviewed support. Between January 2010 and April 2014, MCCBP members have authored 771 cancer-related publications, of which 25% resulted from intra-programmatic and 38% from inter-programmatic collaborations. Approximately 42% of the papers represent collaborations with external investigators. The overall aim of the Program is to make fundamental discoveries in cancer biology in the key thematic areas. MCCBP leadership and members continue to achieve scientific impact through successful translation of pre-clinical research findings to clinical problems through strategic interactions with UPCI membership of other translational and clinical programs. UPCI support, including shared resources, specifically the Animal Facility, Biostatistics Facility, Cancer Bioinformatics Services, Cancer Genomics Facility, Cancer Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Facility, Cancer Proteomics Facility, Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility, Chemical Biology Facility, Cytometry Facility, Immunological Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, In Vivo Imaging Facility, and Tissue and Research Pathology Services facilitates and enhances MCCBP research."
"9262749","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Infections due to the Gram-negative bacteria Neisseria meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae represent major public health problems around the world. Meningococcal infections total 0.5-1.2 million and cause death of 50,000-135,000 individuals annually worldwide. Infections by N. meningitidis can present with a range of symptoms including sudden onset of fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, and alterations in mental state. The bacteria primarily infect the central nervous system causing cerebrospinal meningitis, but can also cause disseminated disease leading to an overwhelming inflammatory response known as sepsis that can result in vascular leakage, failure in multiple organs, and death or long term sequelae including amputation of limbs, deafness, and seizures. Declines in meningococcal disease have occurred in the last decade in many developed countries due in part to use of polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines to specific serogroups of N. meningitidis, although the vaccines are not 100% effective and do not provide protection against all serogroups or strains. In addition, two new vaccines for serogroup B disease have been approved recently, however approval is only for persons aged 10-25 years, and unanswered questions exist regarding efficacy. Paradoxically, N. meningitidis infects the nasopharynx of 8-20% of the population without causing disease.  There are an estimated 106 million new cases of sexually transmitted gonococcal infections worldwide each year. Those most affected by the disease are women in whom infections are often asymptomatic. From 10- 20% of infected women suffer from pelvic inflammatory disease that can cause chronic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Importantly, a growing number of studies have shown that gonococcal infection can facilitate the transmission of HIV. The lack of a vaccine and increasing number of strains of N. gonorrhoeae that are resistant to treatment with antibiotics have heightened the possibility of loss of control of the transmission of gonorrhea.  Our work has focused on understanding the interactions of a major component of the bacterial membrane, the lipooligosaccharide (LOS), with the human immune system. Preformed components of what is termed the innate immune system are the first line of defense in protection against Gram-negative bacteria such as Neisseria. We have found that the ability of Neisseria to induce a feedback down-regulation of the innate immune response is positively correlated with the inflammatory potential of the bacteria which in turn is mediated by the expression of particular molecular substituents on the LOS. Our data also show that certain elements of the LOS structure assist the bacteria in evading lysis by the complement cascade in the blood and recognition by human antibodies that facilitate phagocytosis by white blood cells. These data are supported by the findings from several other laboratories in the field and previous results from our own research.  This project is focused on testing and developing potential new therapeutic agents that will inhibit the bioactivity of the LOS by enzymatic removal of phosphate and acyl groups on the lipid and by inhibiting the genetic expression or competing for binding specifically to the active site of LOS biosynthetic enzymes. In addition, we will exten our observations regarding the inflammatory potential of the LOS and invasive ability of the Neisseria to interactions with an extensive set of relevant cell types that play a role in Neisseri infections. We will study models of infection in whole blood, in nasopharyngeal, cervical, and endothelial epithelial cells, monocytic cells, vascular endothelial cells, and brain cells, and analyze the bioactivity of LOS when inside of cells. We expect that the results will demonstrate the validity of new therapeutic targets, identify and develop potential new agents for the treatment of Neisseria infections, and increase our understanding of the complex relationship between these uniquely human pathogens and the innate immune system that enables the bacteria to cause disease."

Each DS/IS pair was designed to contain a restriction enzyme (RE) site for selective removal of fluorescence permitting cycles of re-staining and imaging. Currently, little functionality exists to optimally extract the wealth of information in 60+ biomarker channel images. We introduce a novel tool that can dynamically visualize such images, take advantage of the many channels for better cell segmentation even in complex tissue, and automatically correct and register the multiple cycles. In Phase I, a prototype of the imaging system will be built and tested with a subset of labels. Upon confirming feasibility, Phase II will focus on the creation of specific kits and software products in close harmony between biochemistry, software, and research needs."

"9470756","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Adaptation is a critical implementation process that represents the intersection between evidence-based practice (EBP) design by intervention developers and EBP use in practice. Adaptation encompasses not only changes made to EBPs, but also changes made within organizations and service systems to accommodate new practices. Clients, direct service providers, and other organizational and administrative actors influence adaptation over the course of EBP implementation. Current literature acknowledges that adaptation can positively or negatively influence EBP implementation. Because adaptation can bridge?or thwart?translation of a practice into mental health service settings, it is integral to the public health impact of an EBP. Improved understanding of the adaptation process, including how it affects EBP sustainment, will aid in the management of adaptation during EBP implementation. The proposed study systematically explores the process of adaptation and builds upon a series of NIMH-funded research projects that examine SafeCare implementation (two projects under R01MH072961 and R01CE001556). SafeCare is a well-established and behaviorally prescriptive EBP designed to prevent child neglect and improve outcomes for at-risk children. A mixed methods approach will be used to conduct an analysis of the adaptation process among 18 community-based organizations that are implementing SafeCare in California and Oklahoma. A variety of data sources will be used including qualitative interview data from agency administrators and providers, annual survey responses from providers, and fidelity ratings from SafeCare coaches. The aims of the proposed project are to: (1) characterize engagement in adaptation across diverse organizational contexts, (2) examine organizational level predictors of adaptation patterns, and (3) assess the relationship between adaptation and SafeCare sustainment. The applicant will be completing these aims in a rich learning environment comprised of targeted training activities and structured mentorship from an exceptional, well-rounded team of experts. This proposed research and training plan will significantly surpass what the applicant would normally have access to during the dissertation process, enhance her EBP adaptation and sustainment research trajectory, and allow her to meaningfully contribute as an early career implementation science scholar."

This existing infrastructure provides a unique and solid  foundation on which to build the Center?s Community Engagement Core. FIU?s health disparities researchers have built  trust with South Florida communities; the success of the Community Engagement Core, and the Center itself, relies on  this trust. This core will encourage participants to engage in research that addresses minority communities? health  concerns, not only as research participants, but also by contributing to the early design of studies and dissemination of  research results. Many of the FIU investigators in the Community Engagement Core come from underrepresented  backgrounds in science, such as women, and racial and ethnic minorities, with a composition similar to that of our  community. It is these investigators? intimate and long-standing knowledge of the culture and beliefs of the community,  and the ensuing cultural humility, that will facilitate recruitment of local populations into the proposed studies, and the  establishment of long-term relationship with CBOs, such as community clinics, hospitals, wellness organizations, and  others. As in our earlier health disparities work, we will encourage community partners to collaborate with FIU  investigators in study design, study execution, participant recruitment, and dissemination of study findings across the FIU-  RCMI?s proposed, pilot, and preliminary studies. Working with community partners, the Community Engagement Core  will establish and support health disparities research in real life settings."
"9323271","Summary/Abstract Although influenza vaccination is the best available tool for reducing illnesses and deaths due to influenza, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary substantially from year to year, depending on the antigenic match between circulating viruses and vaccine strains. To guide the ongoing development of influenza vaccination recommendations, we propose to conduct annual estimates of influenza VE, influenza burden of illness, and cases prevented by vaccination. We will conduct active surveillance for medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza in a predefined cohort. We will identify patients seeking ambulatory care for acute respiratory illness; eligible and consenting patients will be enrolled in the study. We will collect specimens for respiratory virus testing from all participants, which will be tested for influenza (including type, subtype, and lineage) via nucleic acid amplification. We will determine risk factors for influenza, and illness outcomes, through a combination of questionnaires and administrative healthcare databases. We will determine subjects' influenza vaccination history through self-report, validated using an immunization registry. Data will be shared with CDC and other participating sites to provide mid-season and end-of-season VE estimates. We will estimate VE using a test-negative design, comparing the odds of vaccination among subjects who test positive for influenza with the odds among subjects testing negative. We will provide annual estimates stratified by virus type/subtype/lineage and by age group. Because we are identifying patients with influenza from a defined cohort, we will also estimate the incidence of medically attended influenza in our study population, and estimate the number of influenza cases averted by vaccination.  This project will also serve as a resource for studying VE and epidemiology of a novel influenza virus, should an influenza pandemic occur during the study period. We will work with CDC and other sites to prepare and pilot-test protocols for pandemic studies. In addition, this project provides a platform for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surveillance, which can provide important data on the epidemiology of RSV prior to licensure of RSV vaccines. We will test specimens for RSV and estimate the incidence of medically attended RSV in our study population. Finally, we will use data collected from this study to further explore potential biases and limitations of the test-negative design and to anticipate possible effects of RSV vaccine licensure on influenza VE estimates from test-negative studies.  The proposed research will 1) generate data to guide influenza prevention actions and recommendations; 2) provide baseline data on RSV incidence prior to vaccine licensure; and 3) enhance our understanding of the test-negative study design."
"9484911","PROJECT SUMMARY  Latino youth are a population at risk for chronic diseases because of their growing overweight and obesity rates, lack of adherence to nutrition and physical activity recommendations, and greater rates of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs use than youth of other ethnic groups. Parents are an important agent of change for youth due to their ability to create a home environment that promotes healthful behaviors (including substance use prevention and healthy nutrition), and parents' role as providers of resources to the family (including food). Parenting interventions are efficacious in preventing substance use among Latino youth, but few studies have used a family approach to promote healthy nutrition. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed project is to extend the scope of Families Preparing the New Generation (FPNG), an existing parenting program proven to help reduce substance use among Latino youth, to also promote healthy nutrition. The ecodevelopmental perspective will provide the theoretical foundation for the project for investigating risk and resiliency in Latino youth's drug use and nutrition behaviors. Our main aims are to (1) test the effects of a nutrition-enhanced parenting program (FPNG+) on substance use and nutrition among Latino youth, (2) explore how enhancing parenting skills impact the effects of the enhanced intervention, and (3) understand how social and cultural factors impact how the enhanced program works. We will first seek input from community members to create a nutrition-enhanced program that is acceptable to Latino parents of middle school students. We will then collaborate with the American Dream Academy (ADA), an organization delivering an academic success program to families within middle schools throughout the Phoenix Area, to recruit 1,494 families who have a student in 7th grade to participate in the study. Parents from different schools will be offered one of three 10- week programs (assigned to each individual school): FPNG+ (substance use prevention and healthy nutrition), FPNG (substance use prevention only), and the ADA comparison program (focusing on academic success). We will collect data from the 7th grade student and his/her participating parent before the start of the program, immediately after it ends, and 16 weeks later, to compare how the programs affect nutrition, substance use, and parenting. In a subgroup of 126 families (42 from each program), we will explore how the FPNG+ program affects diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors and whether the program induces changes in the types of foods available at participants' homes. For this, we will collect capillary blood samples from participants to measure glycosylated hemoglobin (a marker of diabetes risk) and cholesterol (a marker of cardiovascular risk), and blood pressure, as well as a list of foods that participants have at home. Our long-term goal is to design and disseminate programs that contribute to helping parents assist their adolescent children develop and maintain long-lasting positive lifestyle behaviors in order to prevent substance use and chronic diseases."
"9444177","Abstract The ability to understand neural circuit mechanisms underlying behavior and motor control is critically dependent on our ability to modulate the activity of functional neural circuits reversibly, and with single cell precision. This project will causally test the predictions from Projects1-4 and in turn inform the models, data analyses and data collection in other Projects 2-4. For a clear understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying motor control, cell-specific cortical and subcortical areas will be optogenetic manipulated through the use of closed-loop paradigms to directly assess the contributions of particular neural populations, or particular types of activity dynamics, on motor control. We will use 3 types of closed-loop operant paradigms: i) closed-loop paradigms where we optogenetically manipulate the activity of specific neuronal populations based on the behavioral state, ii) closed-loop paradigms where we optogenetically manipulate the activity of specific neuronal populations based on their activity, and iii) closed-loop paradigms where the neural activity will produce a specific behavioral outcome. We will test the contribution of cortical and subcortical areas to the activity of specific CSN populations and motor behavior by triggering the optogenetic manipulations on particular epochs of the behavior. We will also characterize the role of functionally identified neurons by using holographic optogenetic manipulations triggered by the neural activity patterns. Finally, we will use optical closed-loop operant brain-machine paradigms to investigate how upstream neural populations contribute to activity of corticospinal neurons versus non-corticospinal neurons in motor cortex. These experiments will test with multiple approaches the same hypotheses, and will permit us to causally establish causal connections between neural activity in different areas, and neural activity and behavior. They will provide unvaluable knowledge about the role of particular corticospinal neurons with specific projection patterns or with specific activity patterns, and also inform us about the identity and the contributions of cortical and subcortical neural populations to corticospinal activity, and to movement."

"9326261","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colon cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women in the United States. It is defined by the transformation of the colon epithelium from regulated crypt growth to uncontrolled proliferation and invasion into the surrounding mucosa. The primary mutations that drive this transformation target the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by stabilizing -catenin to force overexpression of Wnt target genes and Wnt activity. Despite this chronic Wnt activation, the level of signaling activity within the tumoris heterogeneous, with regions of high and low Wnt activity, suggesting environmental signals crosstalk with the pathway. As one in five colon cancer patients are first identified with metastatic disease, and the typical survival for these patients post-diagnosis is five years, there is a pressing need to understand fluctuations in Wnt activity and how the tumor microenvironment can influence colon cancer progression and invasion. This project focuses on how heterogeneity of Wnt signaling in colon cancer is established through its modulation both by autocrine signaling and crosstalk signaling from stromal cells. Our lab and others have recently discovered that decreasing autocrine Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells through inhibition of Wnt ligand secretion leads to increased cell migration and invasion. Based upon published research and my preliminary findings, my overarching hypothesis is that Wnt signaling activity in colon cancer is down regulated during cancer invasion and metastasis. I will address this hypothesis in three specific aims. The first specific aim will identify the Wnt signaling pathway involved in inhibiting mobility. Scratch assays, three-dimensional tumor spheroid assays, and novel microfluidic devices developed here at UC Irvine will be used to measure changes in cancer cell phenotype when various Wnt pathways are perturbed. In the second aim, I will identify the receptors expressed by colon cancer cells that participate in the activation of the pathway. Lastly, I will specifically define the ligand: receptor interaction(s) tat are involved in inhibiting cell migration. Identifying this mechanism has potential therapeutic benefits in understanding how colon cancer metastasizes to distant organs."

"9350788","! Project Summary  A major clinical issue in most cancers is relapse. Patients often respond very well to chemotherapy, and can go years without any sign of disease, but a subset of patients will invariably re- develop their cancer with a poor final prognosis. Relapse occurs because our current chemotherapies are unable to reliably and completely eliminate tumor propagating cells, also known as cancer stem cells. These cells are unique among the tumor cell population in that they can self-renew, meaning that they can replenish a tumor cell population indefinitely, similar to the role of the normal tissue stem cells in tissue and organ maintenance. Preventing self-renewal in tumor propagating cells would cause them to terminally differentiate, thereby blocking their ability to form relapse. Unfortunately, self-renewal of tumor propagating cells is not well understood, precluding rational drug design. A major issue in regards to studying these cells is their rarity; they often comprise 1 in every 105-107 cells within the total tumor cell population in human cancers and mouse models, and culture ex vivo alters their self-renewal capability. Researchers necessarily rely on FACS enrichment based on certain cell surface markers, but this biases towards the cells expressing the markers and excludes some subsets of self-renewing cells.  The goal of this project is to have a major impact in the biomedical field by defining self-renewal in tumor propagating cells in a completely unbiased manner. We will use leukemia propagating cells as a model and determine how these cells differ from normal hematopoeitic stem cells, which can also self- renew, and how are they unique from other leukemic cells that cannot self-renew. Based on these data, we will find ways to detect leukemia propagating cells in patients, and identify drugs that can inhibit their self-renewal ability. Initially, we will use a panel of high self-renewing acute lymphoblastic leukemias and normal hematopoietic stem cells isolated from zebrafish models, which will allow us to use single cell RNA sequencing to identify the unique gene expression profile of self-renewing leukemia propagating cells without the need for FACS enrichment. We will translate our findings to human cells to build a biomarker panel that can detect the frequency of self-renewing cells in patient samples, and tell us whether chemotherapy has successfully eliminated them. We will also characterize the stem cell niche in leukemias with high and low self-renewal rates, to identify how the niche is regulating self-renewal rate. Finally, we will use transplantation approaches in zebrafish, as well as new zebrafish models in which the leukemia propagating cells are fluorescently labeled, for high-throughput, in vivo drug screens to identify compounds that impair self-renewal. In total, this project will provide an unbiased genomic and functional analysis of tumor propagating cells, allowing us to answer fundamental questions about the biology of this important tumor cell type."
"9566490","How do mutations in genes implicated in human mental/neurodevelopmental disorders progressively scale up from a single molecular defect to protein networks (interactome), the physiology of the synapse, and behavior? We seek answers to this question as they hold promising explanatory and interventional power in neurodevelopmental disorders. We have chosen to address this question using the combined power of reverse genetics in Drosophila, cell-free reconstitution, and mutant mouse experimentation on the experimentally defined dysbindin-BLOC-1 interactome. We evaluate mechanisms and phenotypic consequences of genetically manipulating the neurodevelopmental disorder pathway constituted by dysbindin-BLOC-1 and two dysbindin-BLOC-1 interactome mechanisms at the synapse. These mechanisms are NSF- and SNARE-dependent vesicle fusion and Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. In this application, will determine the functional consequences of genetically perturbing these two dysbindin-BLOC-1 mechanisms on the physiology of the Drosophila NMJ synapse and two forms of synaptic plasticity: presynaptic homeostatic plasticity and a simple form of learning, short-term olfactory habituation. We postulate that the dysbindin-BLOC-1 interactome is necessary for presynaptic endosome vesicle traffic to establish presynaptic homeostatic plasticity and olfactory habituation. Our application is an important contribution to the novel and emerging concept that defective actin polymerization and vesicle fusion at synapses are core mechanisms impaired in mental disease."
"9406666","Multiple cognitive processes are related to academic outcomes in learning disabilities (LDs), but how processes influence academic skill, and whether academic skill learning changes cognitive processes is unclear1-7. Studies relating academic outcomes and cognitive processes are often not informed by theories that specify the nature of their relations. The focus of Project 2 is on attention because: (1) cognitive attention is a ?hub? ability that fosters development of higher cognitive functions, making it an important target to study in children with learning difficulties8; (2) behavioral attention difficulties often co-occur with academic difficulties. Their presence increases the severity of the learning problem9; (3) attention may have both ?state-like? and ?trait-like? properties, but little research has tested these ideas in individuals with learning difficulties; (4) (visual) attention has been implicated in theories of word reading10-12, and internal control over attention has been implicated in reading comprehension; however, the nature and size of these relations in children with reading difficulties is unclear; (5) research on attention has a rich theoretical and empirical base that are rarely employed for studying the relation of attention and academic performance; (6) attention is a potential candidate skill that may be advantaged in individuals who are proficient at multiple languages, thereby making Project 2 (Attention) particularly relevant. Consistent with the RFA, we focus on a group with persistent reading difficulties that is historically underserved ? middle-school aged current or former English learners with a range of language proficiencies, and where Spanish is a home language. Project 2 builds on findings from the previous 5 years that focused on executive function and its relation with academic skill. Project 2 intersects with each of other projects in this Center, with three aims that address the relation of attention, reading, and reading difficulties. Aim 1 examines how attention interacts with academic skills over time by assessing both longitudinally, for different types of attention, different components of reading and math, and for students with and without reading difficulties (n = 424 to 1044). Aim 2 is focused on parsing the contribution of two aspects of attention to reading: visual attention and internal control over attention conceptualized as ?mind wandering? (total n = 270). We focus on these aspects of attention because of theories that specifically relate them to word reading and fluency and to reading comprehension, seeking to understand the conditions under which these aspects of attention can be manipulated to impact reading and reading difficulties. Aim 3 uses the Aim 1 sample (n = 424) in a measurement study to address the structure of attentional constructs to one another, and to closely related constructs (processing speed, working memory). Because the aspects of attention we study are chosen from known theory, and situated within a generalized taxonomy of attention13, Project 2 (Attention) will clarify the role of attention for reading in the context of several other reading predictors (e.g., language)."
"9516535","ABSTRACT  The kidney is the major source of erythropoietin (EPO) production in adults. Loss of EPO-producing cells in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients causes depressed red blood cell production and is a significant contributor to morbidity. Although CKD patients can be treated by systemic administration of EPO, this leads to sporadic and excessive peaks in hormone availability, which may provide growth stimuli to certain tumors. In addition, administration of recombinant EPO or EPO stimulating agents (ESAs) to CKD patients is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events including cardiac arrest and stroke. It is not clear whether these morbidities are caused by excessive red blood cell number (polycythemia) stimulated by EPO or off-target effects of EPO itself. Finally, the cost of administering recombinant EPO to CKD patients now represents a significant proportion of the Medicare budget. Therefore, there are strong clinical and economic incentives for deriving an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived EPO-producing cell that could be used to treat anemic CKD patients. We propose to define conditions to generate EPO-producing cells by directed differentiation through recapitulating the developmental process that specifies this cell type within the developing kidney. Genetic analyses have revealed that the renal EPO-producing cell (REPC) is a stromal fibroblast located around proximal tubules in the outer medulla of the kidney. REPCs derive from the Foxd1-expressing stromal precursor population that is present only during the period of active kidney development. The REPC population has been difficult to identify because EPO is only expressed upon hypoxia, and other markers to specifically identify these cells are lacking. A deeper understanding of the molecular identity of the REPC is essential to define a target state for directed differentiation of iPSCs. We therefore propose to: 1. Define the molecular profile of normoxic REPCs through genetic labelling and isolation, and 2. Use EPO-reporter iPSCs to test the capacity of organoid differentiation protocols to generate hypoxia responsive EPO-producing cells. Because the EPO-producing cell has only been spatially defined in the mouse, we see this tandem approach using both mouse genetic tools and organoids differentiated from genetically modified human iPSCs as essential. The experiments are technically feasible, and our group has expertise in stromal cell biology, which will be essential to developing differentiation conditions. In the short term we would aim to functionally test these cells by encapsulating them in microspheres and implanting them into the abdominal cavities of mice subjected to nephrectomy. In the long term, we would aim to incorporate hypoxia-responsive, EPO-producing cells into synthetic kidney tissue destined for clinical translation."
"9568921","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age is the largest single risk factor for the majority of diseases seen in clinics throughout the U.S. Demographic calculations predict that eliminating any single age-related disease would produce only a modest increase in human health span (years of healthy life) or life span. However, postponing or decreasing the rate of aging would retard the course of multiple age-related diseases and thus substantially increase health span and likely life span. Our ability to develop rational approaches to preventing or intervening in th debilitating and costly consequences of aging depends crucially on a thorough understanding of the causes of aging and how they interact with the etiology of specific age-related diseases. Training young scientists to integrate research on basic aging mechanisms with mechanisms of specific age-related diseases is a critical objective of this application. The long-term goal of ths training program is to provide exceptional young scientists with the broad knowledge, skills and interactions they will need to mitigate, through research, the enormous human and financial burdens caused by aging and age-related diseases. Each year, the program will train 12 talented postdoctoral scientists who will conduct research for a 2-year period in one or more of 32 laboratories headed by outstanding preceptors at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University. Trainees will participate in research projects that include basic mechanisms of cellular stress responses, protein homeostasis, genomic and epigenomic stability, stem cell maintenance, bioenergetics and energy metabolism and hormonal, growth factor and nutrient signaling path- ways. They will utilize a variety of model systems including yeast, round and flat worms, fruit flies, fish, mice and human cells and tissues. And they will focus on an array of age-related diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, stroke, cardiac and vascular dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Trainees will be instructed in state-of-the-art techniques in genomics, epigenomics, drug screening, proteomics and metabolomics, as well as genetics, biochemistry, structural biology, cell biology, and cell and organismal imaging. They will receive the benefits of diverse seminar series and other scientific events and frequent networking opportunities. They will also attend courses in specialized scientific topics, as well as courses in ethics, presentation skills, proposal and manuscript writing, and laboratory management skills. The program will fill an important national and international need for high-quality advanced training that integrates basic aging research with research on age-related disease."
"9434501","PROJECT SUMMARY More than 16 million adults suffer from Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in the United States and the estimated annual economic burden of AUD is $249 billion. Approximately 88,000 Americans die from alcohol-related causes each year; untreated AUD is the fourth most preventable cause of death in the US. Four medications have been approved by the FDA to date for treating AUD, but none of these medications have proven to be effective across the heterogeneous groups of people with this disorder. Treating addiction more effectively has become a national priority and accelerating drug development for AUD is one of the priorities for NIAAA. The present proposal is intended to answer this call for accelerating drug development by exploring the potential of a novel anticonvulsant, lacosamide, as a candidate medication for the treatment of AUD. This drug, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of seizure disorders, has unique pharmacological actions that include enhancement of slow sodium channel inactivation and inhibition of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2). Alcohol consumption in mice that had knockdown of CRMP-2 within the nucleus accumbens was decreased from levels seen in control animals. In rodent studies, lacosamide administration has produced reductions in `excessive' drinking and has experimentally-induced decreased expression of the CRMP-2 protein. These findings implicate CRMP-2 as playing a role in the regulation of alcohol consumption. None of the FDA-approved AUD medications or medications commonly used off-label to treat AUD target this CRMP-2 pathway, making lacosamide a promising compound for AUD drug development. The aims of this study are to: 1) test the effects of lacosamide on alcohol self-administration and craving, 2) assess the effects of lacosamide on the reinforcing stimulant effects of a priming drink of alcohol, 3) test the effects of 5 days of lacosamide administration on cognitive function, and 4) test the effects of lacosamide on alcohol consumption and craving during a 5-day period of exposure. The effects of 5-days of lacosamide (300mg) or placebo will be evaluated in a human laboratory using an alcohol self-administration methodology. In this within-subjects crossover design, heavy drinkers (N=24) will be randomized to the order of exposure (lacosamide or placebo) prior to completing two alcohol self-administration trials. Subjects will receive a priming drink of alcohol and will have access to 8 alcoholic drinks over a 2-hour period. We anticipate that subjects will consume less alcohol during an alcohol self-administration trial when receiving lacosamide compared to when they are receiving placebo. Significant lacosamide-induced reductions in the quantity of alcohol self-administered will be considered to be an indication that this drug may have value as an AUD medication. This study may provide a rationale for phase II clinical studies testing lacosamide with a treatment-seeking AUD population. These results may also help to spur further pre-clinical investigation into the role played by CRMP-2 in regulating both alcohol consumption and alcohol seeking behaviors."
"9445873","Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single ?hub? site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the ?hub? where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the ?spoke? sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter."

Detecting these T-cells and their cytokines provide critically needed predictive biomarkers for defining responders versus non- responders. IsoPlexis technology provides both the ability to rapidly isolate TILs from tumor samples and to detect their full functional cytokine excretion response to treatment. In Phase I of our IMAT SBIR Project, IsoPlexis developed a dual-function device that can capture a specific cell type from a complex mixture of cells via DNA tethered (DEAL) antibody technology developed in (SAB member, Cal Tech Professor) Jim Heath?s lab. Upon removal of the non-targeted cells, the captured T cells are then immediately released via site-specific DNA cleavage of the DEAL tether and transferred into a field of single-cell capture micro-troughs. Then these microtroughs are encapsulated by an antibody barcoded slide (SCBCTM). Once isolated in each microchamber, the barcode of antibodies collects 32+ different clinically relevant proteins being sent from each T cell. For Phase II of this project, we will further develop the duo cell capture technology integrating IsoPlexis automation technology to isolate melanoma TILs. Aim 1: Develop TILs capture and release system for immunotherapy and highly-multiplexed SCBC protein capture panel customized for TILs functional response profiling. Aim 2: Develop robust, fully automated assay processing for seamless incorporation into the clinical laboratory. Demonstrate the utility of the automation system for easy-to-use enrichment and analysis protocol validating with 30+ melanoma TILs samples. Aim 3: Implement fully automated workflow at Yale trial site to profile responders vs. non-responders across 20 patients. Combining technological improvements of Aims 1 and 2, IsoPlexis will demonstrate pre-and post-monitoring of responder differences, using multi-functional and phenotypic profile of cytotoxic T cells monitoring a mid-scale cohort of patients (20) over a 6 month period."
"9386096","Project Summary - IFGeneRA OVERALL Component The Individual Findings in Genetics Research in Africa (IFGeneRA) H3Africa ELSI Collaborative Centre aims to progressively build an evidence base that forms the basis for context- and country specific development of policies relating to the return of individual genetic research results for African genomic research, and to act as an ethics resource for the H3Africa Consortium. We will a) collect empirical evidence from a wide range of stakeholders in both rural and urban settings in three African countries, b) combine methodologies from genetic counselling, social science, anthropology, bioinformatics, health economics and normative ethical analysis to progressively develop this evidence base, and c) test the wider acceptability and applicability of findings we generate in a continental survey that will be administered to relevant stakeholders throughout Africa. In Project 1, we will retrospectively investigate the effect of a genetic diagnosis on the lives of families affected by Fragile X in rural Cameroon. In that project, we will also explore the relation between traditional and modern genetic knowledge, and develop a video documentary about our study as part of our community engagement activities. In Project 2, we will conduct a prospective study to explore the expectations and preferences for feedback of individual genetic research findings in a cohort of healthy controls and patients involved in genomics research in Gaborone, Botswana and Cape Town, South Africa. The study involves (parents or guardians of) children and adults enrolled in genomics research projects focusing on HIV/AIDS, neurodevelopmental conditions and psychotic disorders. In that project, we will also conduct in-depth interviews with people involved in developing, implementing and applying ethical standards and policies for return of individual study results in genomics research in Botswana and South Africa. We will use drama as a means to discuss ethical aspects of our work with community members involved in our research. In Project 3, we will focus on exploring practical and normative considerations relating to decisions to feedback findings in African Genomics Research. Step 1 will combine methods from medical genetics, bioinformatics and health economics to generate practical insight into the scope of the feedback of findings discussion in Africa. In Step 2 we will conduct a normative ethical analysis of ethics literature describing obligations to (not) feedback individual genetic findings for researchers based in low- and middle income African countries. In Step 3 we will draw on the findings from all stages of the three projects to develop an online continental survey exploring wider approaches to practical and ethical considerations relating to the feedback of individual genetic research results."
"9176337","Alphaviruses are small enveloped plus-sense RNA viruses with highly organized structures. They include important human pathogens such as Chikungunya virus and the encephalitic alphaviruses, which are classified as category B or C priority pathogens. In spite of the medical importance of the alphaviruses there are currently no licensed antiviral therapies or vaccines. Alphaviruses infect cells through endocytosis and low pH-triggered fusion, replicate in the cytoplasm, and bud through the plasma membrane. Budding requires the specific 1:1 interaction of the E2 viral envelope protein with the capsid protein in the nucleocapsid core. This grant will address key questions on alphavirus assembly and budding and the role of host proteins in these processes. Our studies will focus on the highly- developed alphavirus experimental systems Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus, and the emerging pathogen Chikungunya virus. We propose three integrated aims to define the alphavirus exit pathway: 1. Alphavirus remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Alphaviruses remodel the host cell cytoskeleton to generate long intercellular extensions that contain actin and stable microtubules and can transmit virus particles to new cells. Induction of extensions requires the capsid-E2 interaction and can be recapitulated by expression of the viral structural proteins in the absence of virus infection. We will determine the properties of the extensions, the viral protein requirements for their generation, and the cellular signaling pathways that the virus coopts to cause this dramatic remodeling. 2. Tetherin inhibition of alphavirus release. BST2/Tetherin is an interferon-induced host membrane protein that acts to inhibit the release of a number of enveloped viruses from their host cells. Tetherin has two isoforms, with L-tetherin containing a 12 residue extension of the amino terminal cytoplasmic domain compared to S-tetherin. Our evidence indicates that alphavirus restriction by tetherin has a novel isoform specificity: only L-tetherin causes efficient restriction, without a role for an alphavirus-encoded tetherin antagonist. We will determine the mechanism of this unique restriction profile by comparison of the activities of L- vs. S-tetherin in the alphavirus exit pathway. 3. Pathway of capsid protein incorporation into virus. We are developing a targeted BirA method to tag capsid protein with biotin at specific cellular locations on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or plasma membranes, or in the cytoplasm. We will exploit this novel method to track capsid protein using pulse-chase biotinylation together with biochemical and morphological assays. Results will define the precursor to the alphavirus nucleocapsid and its traffic to the plasma membrane. Together these aims will reveal critical mechanisms in the alphavirus exit pathway and provide important functional information on host cell proteins during virus infection."

UNC-CEHS serves North Carolina, and ultimately the southeastern United States and the nation with innovative and strategic scientific activities and community engagement."
"9404635","Abstract Among the 2.1 million adolescents aged 10-19 living with HIV in 2012, 82% were in sub-Saharan Africa, and among these, 58% were girls. In sub-Saharan Africa, women?s HIV risk is linked with their experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV). Adolescence is a key time to target social norms linked to HIV and IPV because adolescents are forming ideas about normative behavior and their first sexual relationships during this time. A recent systematic review of HIV prevention interventions for young people in sub-Saharan Africa found that few interventions were effective in part because social norms for sexual behavior were overlooked. One intervention approach that has been successful in targeting norms and sustaining changes for HIV-related behaviors is to intervene with social networks. Network interventions often leverage central, trusted, and/or popular network members to deliver risk reduction messages to their known network contacts, thereby diffusing health promoting norms to people in their immediate social environment. The level of cohesion within networks may also amplify the effect of peer norms on behaviors. However, network interventions have not yet been fielded with adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa. Working with networks might also be strategic for reaching adolescent girls who are not in school, an increasingly important population to curbing the HIV epidemic globally. Two key first steps to a network HIV and IPV prevention intervention approach with adolescent girls are: identifying the networks of adolescent girls; and understanding how networks influence adolescent girls? HIV and IPV related behaviors. Our team, with funding from NIMH, has successfully located social networks of young men at risk for HIV in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; we propose using a similar strategy to identify networks of adolescent girls in one ward (equivalent to a US census tract) of Dar es Salaam. Our aims are to: (1) Identify venue-based social networks of adolescent girls, aged 15-19, in Dar es Salaam using the rigorous PLACE methodology, involving community informant interviews and mapping; characterize 15-20 networks (density and centralization, etc.) by conducting surveys with all adolescent girls in 15-20 networks and in-depth interviews with key informants; and describe associations between network characteristics, norms and behaviors related to HIV and IPV. (2) Assess the acceptability of a network approach that seeks to change norms for HIV risk behaviors and IPV, while enhancing cohesion within girls? networks, by piloting approaches, messages and communication channels with girls. This proposal is lead by an early-stage investigator with expertise in youth networks in Dar es Salaam. The proposal is responsive to RFA-MH-17-555 by developing a social network intervention to alter adolescent girls? HIV and IPV related norms and behaviors. Reaching adolescent girls through their networks may prove strategic for implementing a variety of HIV prevention strategies."
"9358767","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement (PAR-16-369) ?Resource-Related Research Projects for Development of Animal Models and Related Materials (R24).? Our proposal addresses the goals stated in the Research Objectives: ?The grant supports research projects that contribute to the knowledge of a model system, making the system more useful and accessible to the research community.? Specifically, we will generate a resource of Drosophila cell lines, markers, and knockouts that will enable cell biological analysis of genes and pathways altered in human diseases, including in disease-relevant tissue lineages and genetic backgrounds. In recent years, we have witnessed renewed interest in Drosophila cell lines and it is now common for Drosophila researchers to go back and forth between in vivo and cell culture studies. However, the full potential of Drosophila cell lines, particularly for disease-related studies, has not yet been realized, as the diversity of cell lines and markers available is limited. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose to use exciting new advances in cell line immortalization and genome engineering to generate reagents that will enable the community to fully exploit the power of Drosophila cell lines to address disease-related cell biological questions. Specifically, we propose to: Aim 1: Generate new cell lines from specific Drosophila cell lineages that will enable screens and other studies in relevant tissue-derived cell lines; Aim 2: Use CRISPR genome engineering to generate a resource of cell lines expressing fluorescent markers of sub-cellular components that will enable the community to perform screens exploring organelles and cell biological events relevant to human disease; and Aim 3: Use CRISPR engineering to generate knockout cell lines for synthetic lethal screens and other applications. We will disseminate information and resources for creating cell disease models by making available to the community detailed protocols and plasmid vectors, as well as the new cell lines and derivatives. Importantly, as Drosophila is an established system for the study of diverse human diseases, the resource and tools that we will develop are relevant to nearly all NIH institutes. Finally, we document that these resources will have benefit beyond the Drosophila community as they can be used in a number of creative ways to uncover exciting new information about conserved gene function, protein complexes and interactions, organelle function under normal or perturbed conditions, and more."
"9562426","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity has reached global epidemic proportions in both adults and children. Obesity has a major impact on cardiovascular (CV) disorders because of its adverse effects on cardiac function, structure, and various CV risk factors. MR imaging has great potential in estimating these changes and stratifying obese subjects for risk of major advanced cardiac events. However, the physiological changes resulting from obesity and associated pulmonary comorbidities often make it difficult for many obese subject to comply with current clinical protocols that require several breath holds and long scan time. Short free breathing protocols are urgently needed for the cardiac evaluation of obese subjects. The main goal of this proposal is to develop a short 3-D free-breathing & un-gated cardiac imaging protocol to evaluate cardiac structure, function, perfusion, and fibrosis in obese subjects in around twenty minutes of scan time. This protocol is enabled by synergistic developments in novel ungated sequences and a novel manifold regularization framework. The reconstruction framework, which exploits the manifold structure of images and patches in the dataset, is ideally suited to harness the flexibility and high acquisition efficiency of ungated 3-D sequences. The main hypothesis is that the implicit motion compensated and motion resolved reconstruction scheme will provide good recovery of the datasets in the protocol from highly under sampled data. We will quantitatively determine the utility of the free-breathing & ungated framework to provide reconstructions that are equivalent to current breath-hold acquisitions. This framework is expected to significantly improve the compliance of obese subjects. In addition, this approach also provides co-registered 3-D volumes with different contrasts, which will greatly improve quantification, visualization, and radiologic interpretation. The manifold learning framework is powerful and highly innovative; it can be readily applied to a variety of dynamic applications beyond cardiac imaging (vocal tract imaging, liver imaging, lung imaging). Our team is well qualified to perform the proposed research because of our combined scope and breadth in expertise (including signal processing, MR physics, and radiology), in addition to the extensive preliminary data."
"9560984","Our current understanding of human cancer highlights the importance of aberrant developmental programs in  cancer pathogenesis. With this in mind, leadership of the Simmons Cancer Center created the Development  and Cancer (DC) Scientific Program as one of its pillars.  Program membership continues to reflect efforts to comprehensively reach across the campus by flanking  laboratory researchers with physician-scientists. The 34 members drawn from 16 departments include 16  faculty members with formal clinical or clinician-scientist training, perfectly poised to close the gap between the  bench and bedside. The DC Program includes investigators from the fields of cancer, stem cell, and  developmental biology, exploiting existing strengths and recent recruitments, to tackle the crucial questions  that will allow us to improve cancer diagnosis, therapy, and ultimately, prevention. Complementing the other  scientific programs in the Cancer Center, DC members investigate the developmentally and evolutionarily  conserved ancestral themes that are fundamental to cell and organism growth, development, and physiology,  and how these factors influence cancer biology. To cover such diverse developmental properties, DC leaders  identified five themes that form the core structure of the program:  ? Theme 1. Tumor-Stroma Interactions;  ? Theme 2. Oncogene and Tumor Suppressor Gene Biology;  ? Theme 3. Cancer Cell Programming;  ? Theme 4. Epigenetics and Cell Fate; and  ? Theme 5. Stem Cell Biology.  The current NCI ($4.1 million) and total peer-reviewed funding ($24.9 million) nearly doubles the grant funding  at the program?s inception in 2009. Critically, several funded projects represent multi-investigator efforts within  and beyond our institution. DC Program members have authored 327 peer-reviewed publications since the  past review, nearly doubling the productivity for the three years prior to the most recent review. The  manuscripts with intra-programmatic (13%) and inter-programmatic (36%) footprints nearly doubled as well,  and 24% of them included investigators from other NCI-designated cancer centers."
"9342731","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide sequencing technologies have allowed an unprecedented discovery of somatic mutations in epigenetic modifiers in human cancers, providing mechanistic links between cancer epigenomes and genetic alterations. The collective number of oncogenic activating mutations in epigenetic regulators has led to the emerging view of driver mutations underlying cancer epigenomes. Nowhere is this better illustrated than with recent findings of high-frequency missense mutations in core histones, such as histone H3 lysine 27 to methionine (H3K27M) and glycine 34 to arginine/valine (G34R/V) mutations in pediatric gliomas, and H3K36M mutations in pediatric chondroblastomas, particularly aggressive cancers that remain poorly understood and for which there are no effective therapies. Our biochemical studies suggest that the 'K-to-M' mutant histones can inhibit the enzymatic activity of responsible histone methyltransferases (HMTs), such as Ezh2 for H3K27 methylation, and SETD2 for H3K36 methylation. Oddly, histone mutations and HMT mutations are never found in the same type of cancer. These observations lead us to hypothesize that H3 'K-to-M' mutations play distinct functions beyond just inactivation of HMTs, which may be key to the lineage-specific pathogenesis of the respective cancers. Here, we propose multidisciplinary and integrative approaches, using genetics (cell line and mouse models), epigenetics (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq), proteomics (quantitative mass spectrometry) and chemical biology (designer chromatin) to gain mechanistic insights into how a mutated histone code functions towards disrupting epigenetic landscapes that, in turn, lead to cancer progression. A world-class team of experts in cancer, chromatin and chemical biology are assembled to explore novel approaches to these devastating childhood cancers. The single goal of our Program is to illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying oncohistone mutations to advance the diagnosis and exploration of therapeutic avenues for the associated pediatric cancers. Specifically, we will: i) investigate how histone mutations affect the cross-talk between other histone and DNA modifications; ii) identify the changes in chromatin landscape by histone mutations using cell-based systems, animal models and patient tumor samples; iii) characterize misregulated developmental programs that help establish tumorigenesis; and iv) specifically engineer chemically-defined chromatin templates for use in in vitro biochemical reactions aimed at a detailed mechanistic dissection of how histone mutations alter HMT activities. These studies will provide guidance for the development of therapeutic strategies designed to ameliorate the pathogenic effects of histone mutations and HMTs in these childhood cancers. Also, novel immunological reagents will be generated for much-needed immunohistochemistry (IHC) diagnosis of tumor samples."
"9557685","Project Summary  The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT, 1983-1993) compared intensive therapy aimed at near normal glycemia versus conventional therapy with no specific glucose targets in 1441 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) over a mean follow-up of 6.5 yrs. Intensive therapy reduced the risks of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy by 35-76%, hyperglycemia being a primary determinant of complications. We also described potential adverse effects of intensive therapy; assessed its effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, neurocognition and quality of life; and projected the lifetime health-economic impact. DCCT intensive therapy was then adopted world-wide as standard-of-care for T1DM.  The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and its Complications (EDIC, 1994-present) is the observational follow-up study of the DCCT cohort, with 94% of those surviving actively participating. Participants are evaluated annually. CVD events and deaths are carefully documented and adjudicated. EDIC has notably shown that the early beneficial effects of intensive versus conventional therapy on complications have persisted for more than 15 years despite the similar HbA1c levels in the two groups during EDIC, termed metabolic memory. Former intensive therapy also greatly reduced the risk of CVD events, advanced microvascular complications, such as chronic kidney disease and eye complications requiring surgery, and mortality. DCCT/EDIC collaborators have also conducted numerous ancillary studies with separate funding.  The overarching goals for the next 5 years (2017-22) will be to take advantage of the loyal and highly characterized DCCT/EDIC cohort and study the occurrence of physical and cognitive dysfunction and more advanced complications, and their risk factors, in this aging type 1 diabetes population. Since current-day diabetes therapy has increased the longevity of people with type 1 diabetes, it is critical to understand how aging affects patients with type 1 diabetes and to define the risk factors for the occurrence of aging sensitive deficits. In addition, the accrual of long-term severe complications will allow the study of their risk factors and the quality-of-life and health economic consequences.  The specific scientific aims are to 1) examine the prevalence of cognitive, affective, and physical impairments in T1DM, and the association of DCCT treatment arm, glycemia, and established and putative non-glycemic risk factors on important domains of aging: cognitive, affective and physical impairments, functional limitations, disability, quality-of-life, frailty, falls, fractures, and survival; 2) analyze the risk factors/mechanisms associated with severe/advanced microvascular complications; 3) analyze the risk factors/mechanisms associated with CVD and mortality; 4) develop new research approaches to measure the progression of diabetes outcomes (vectors) in T1DM, derived from the unique long-term, longitudinal follow-up of the DCCT cohort; and 5) study the long-term economic consequences of T1DM."

The long-term objective is to provide administration, resources, and support aimed at increasing the number of research investigators who acquire extramural funding. This will be accomplished by a creating a stimulating environment that promotes a culture of efficient and timely administrative support that will increase the number of funding submissions and/or acquisitions of extramural funding in biomedical and behavioral research. The Administrative Core (AC) will provide multi-functional administrative support through pre- and post-award services, implementation of objectives, directions and guidance, and oversight to ensure that the specific aims and goals are accomplished. The goals of the TU CBR/RCMI Program application for 2017-2022 are to continue development and support for a competitive, multidisciplinary, collaborative environment that advances an understanding of diseases that disproportionately affect African Americans and underrepresented minorities. The AC that will foster this environment consists of the Principal Investigator (PI), Program Director (PD), Program Manager (PM), Planning and Evaluation Manager (PE), and the CBR/RCMI Advisory Committee (RAC). Members of the AC will assist with the development of concepts, directions, monitoring, and review of research activities and will oversee implementation of program initiatives. The AC support staff includes the Research Center Office - Assistant Director, Academic Support Services, Biostatistician, Information/Publication Services, and RCMI Office Manager. Staff members, who are responsible for day-to-day program management, serve as a liaison between the CBR/RCMI program PI and PD, researchers and administrative oversight departments (i.e., Office of Sponsored Programs, Contracts and Grants, federal funding agencies, purchasing, travel and other administrative and academic departments). AC staff will attend meetings and workshops for professional development and ensure compliance with agency and institutional policies. The primary role of the AC staff is to assist with professional growth of investigators by providing services to promote the development of funding for improved quality and quantity of federal/state investigator-initiated grant submissions. Services provided by AC staff will assist in eliminating administrative burdens on investigators to allow efforts advancing biomedical technologies, core development, and training in areas of drug development and molecular biology. A concerted effort will be made to utilize these applications to expand research experiences and expertise of minority scientists directed to diseases disproportionately affecting minority groups in order to eliminate health disparities."
"9351487","ABSTRACT: In Bangladesh, as in other lower- and middle-income countries, the weak research infrastructure reduces the efficiency of research projects that are undertaken, as many Bangladeshi institutions do not have the complete set of skills (technical, statistical, management, methods, or community engagement skills) to undertake a successful research project and disseminate the results. Morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is growing in these countries, and there is growing evidence that country-specific research is needed to identify risk factors that are unique to the context of LMICs. With the resources of this RCRE grant, we would (1) identify institutions that already have expertise in research practice, and develop a formal framework that encourages the sharing of this expertise across institutions, increasing the efficiency of research by supporting a division of labor (2) increase the robustness of the identified existing expertise by research enhancement activities that allow the collaborators at the partner institutions to hone their skills and disseminate the results of their research and (3) use two pilot projects to engage the newly-formulated RCRE protocol, using the expertise of the RCRE?s shared core facilities and enhancing their research capacity. Collaborators at the University of Chicago have a long history of collaboration with institutions in Bangladesh, including a 15-year history of collaborating with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), the only full medical university in Bangladesh. With this local knowledge, the two lead institutions (UC and BSMMU), selected 6 additional regional research institutions to collaborate with. These six additional institutions will make up the shared core facilities of the RCRE, and will implement aspects of a research protocol that are relevant to their expertise. The shared core facilities are National Institute of Cancer Research & Hospital (NICRH), the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), University of Chicago Research Bangladesh (URB), Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), National Institute of Neurological Diseases (NIND), and the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB). In addition Directorate General of Health Services of Government of Bangladesh will also be a partner in this RCRE. Each of these institutions has a proven ability to excel in one of the five areas of research expertise we identified: clinical and diagnostics; data management, statistics, and informatics; biomarkers; population survey and data collection; and community engagement, outreach, and dissemination. After formally establishing this RCRE, we will implement two pilot research projects whose research topics reflect two key areas of NCD research: the establishment of a pathology-based cancer registry in the capital, Dhaka; and the relationship between the microbiome (which varies greatly between populations) and cardiovascular disease. Each of these pilot projects will be undertaken with the collaboration of the RCRE shared core facilities, and supported by workshops, short courses, and colloquium that have been developed to enhance the existing capacity of the RCRE members. This formal network of collaboration will strengthen the capacity of local researchers to investigate the determinants of NCD in local populations, and lead to better informed policies and care."
"9379627","Many older patients at risk for infections are receiving home healthcare (HHC) services. In a systematic review we found little is known about infections occurring while patients are enrolled in HHC and how best to mitigate infection risk for these vulnerable patients. In pilot work (R03 NR013966), using 2010 national Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data, we have found infections to be a common reason for unplanned hospitalizations among HHC patients. However, OASIS data are limited and likely underestimate the true infection rate. We also found agency-level infection rates varied greatly across the country. The variation across agencies may indicate that recommended guidelines are not being adopted and/or that there are limitations in the guidelines themselves. The HHC environment is the fastest growing healthcare sector in the nation but is less controlled than other settings, is increasing in complexity with patients being discharged from hospitals earlier, and care is often provided by patients, family members, or personal aides with little or no formal training in infection prevention. Informed by our systematic review, pilot work, and Andersen's Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, we propose a 4-year, multiple methods study with the following aims: 1) describe the incidence of infections that occur while patients are receiving HHC and the relationship with patients' predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics; 2) describe the current infection prevention and control infrastructure and policies in HHC agencies; 3) compare the effectiveness of various infection prevention and control infrastructures and policies in preventing infections in HHC; and 4) estimate survival and healthcare utilization associated with infections in HHC patients . In Aim 1, we will use the most current (2013-2015) administrative data (e.g., OASIS and Medicare claims) from 3,333 randomly sampled agencies. In Aim 2, qualitative in-depth, open-ended interviews will be conducted in 12 HHC agencies across the nation to inform the phenomena of infection prevention, refinement of our survey, and Aims 3 and 4. Then, we will survey HHC agencies (expected sample n = 1,333). For Aim 3, we will link the survey data with concurrent patient (n = 133,300) and agency (n = 1,333) data. For Aim 4, we will use longitudinal data (2013-2017) on up to 1 million patients. The econometric analyses will address patients nested within HHC agencies, assess individual risk, and minimize threats to validity. Our multidisciplinary research team is ideally qualified to conduct this study, which will be the first of its kind in HHC. Focusing on infection prevention and control efforts in HHC across the nation is innovative and will extend the infection prevention research paradigm. Results will be seminal in the HHC setting, and evidence developed from this project will inform authors of future practice guidelines, clinicians, managers, and policy makers on the problem of infections and how best to mitigate risk. This research is consistent with NINR's strategic mission that emphasizes multidisciplinary research that develops knowledge to improve wellness and prevent disease."
"9409585","Incisional hernia (IH) can be prevented using prophylactic mesh placement (PMP), which involved placement of mesh to reinforce an abdominal fascia closure before herniation occurs at the index of surgery. PMP reduced the absolute risk of IH, with an acceptable complication profile. Open abdominal surgery techniques remain commonplace and contribute to the estimated 153,000 cases of IH performed in the United States (US) and the associated $3 billion spent on hernia treatment. To reduce these hernias, more widespread adoption of PMP is needed, yet barriers exist to adopting PMP in practice. Surgeon-level barriers are a key impediment due to the added time for PMP (20-30 minutes). A rapid mesh application system can reduce this time and increase utilization of PMP. Further, the reliability and technical challenges inherent to PMP pose significant challenges. These barriers highlight an unmet clinical need for an effective, well-engineered, intra- operative technology to decrease the time and circumvent the technical challenges of applying mesh to the abdominal wall fascia for hernia prevention.  The SafeClose Mesh Augmentation System is a medical grade, hand-held, mesh affixing system. The system increases the speed of mesh affixation and circumvents technical intra-operative challenges by integrating several key steps of the PMP process, including positioning, tensioning, and affixation into one system. The system includes sterilized mesh with pre-integrated fastener anchors along with a customized applicator that houses the mesh-fastener system inside. By pulling the applicator along the length of the incision, the mesh rolls out of the applicator and is simultaneously affixed by the fasteners. In one continuous motion, the entire incision can be reinforced. When the surgeon reaches the bottom of the incision, he/she can cut the mesh off using the built-in cutting mechanism. This newly updated design satisfies important end-user needs by providing an ergonomic yet robust application mechanism, while at the same time allowing the device to accommodate for different incision lengths and sizes giving the user full ability to control the length of mesh that is used.  We propose a feasible, systematic, and step-wise approach to refinement and proof-of-concept for the SafeClose System. Success of this Phase I proposal will be defined by creation of a refined applicator whose core functionality includes a built-in cutting mechanism to reliably and safely cut the mesh after the surgeon has completed the procedure AND demonstration that the SafeClose significantly reduces the time relative to a hand- sewn technique (Aim 2 Experiment 1) while achieving equivalent or improved biomechanical strength of the repair (Aim 2 Experiment 2). The proposed research objectives will advance hernia care and begin a shift towards more preventative risk reductive interventions in abdominal surgery."
"9342742","Summary  The broad goal of this project is to develop a suite of chemistry-driven tools to study the detailed mechanism  by which histone mutations associated with cancers dys-regulate chromatin states, leading to disease. We will  focus our efforts on a set of H3 mutants linked to pediatric gliomas (H3K27M and H3G34R/V) and  chondroblastomas (H3K36M). By combining the use of chemically-defined chromatin templates with  biochemical, proteomic and genomic approaches, we seek to develop a sufficient body of knowledge around  the H3 mutants such that logical paths to therapy can be conceived. As an example of this, we will explore the  idea that the toxic effect of these mutants on methyltransferase activities can be neutralized by manipulation of  other epigenetic modification pathways. We imagine that many of the technologies developed in the context of  this project will have broad utility in the epigenetics field generally."
"9354178","The Data Analysis and Translational and Translational Applications Core (DATA Core) of the  AACORT was established to 1) provide a core center for standardized computational and  bioinformatic analysis of human high-throughput sequencing data, and 2) provide an infrastructure  for the standardized annotation, storage, and sharing of high-dimensional, patient matched data. As  the AACORT pursues translational research on new-onset Alopecia Areata patients, the Resource  Project Members will need a standardized manner of accessing and analyzing the data to ensure  efficient use of the resources. The DATA Core will provide these services, tailoring data analysis to  the needs of the Research Project. It will also serve as an interface with the TRAC Core, which will  primarily be responsible for the clinical aspects of patient acquisition and sample processing.  Biosamples acquired through the clinical arms of the TRAC Core will be processed for  corresponding sequencing services, and the data and all clinical annotations will be passed to the  DATA Core for processing, storage, and subsequent analysis. Additionally, the DATA Core will  collaborate with the TRAC Core in the subsequent design of pilot experiments and research  projects to ensure proper experimental design that provides proper power for the computational  analyses. In terms of specific services, the DATA Core and its personnel are equipped both by  training and in facilities, to handle a broad spectrum of data including: genotyping/exome  sequencing, transcriptomics and regulatory modeling, and immunoproteomics/protein structure  analysis. This will include somatic variant identification, targeted exome sequencing, biomarker  development, master regulatory analysis and network-based drug predictions. It will further include  immunotyping for antigen and TCR sequencing, computational antigen predictions, and leveraging  of single-cell sequencing for pathogenic immune cells. We have assembled a highly trained,  multidisciplinary team of scientists and Investigators at the Columbia University Medical Campus in  Systems Biology, Biophysics, and Computer Science to complement the biological, clinical and  immunological expertise of the other modules of the AACORT. We further have the support of  Columbia Core Facilities, as well as the extensive computational infrastructure of the Center for  Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and the Department of Systems Biology to facilitate the  storage and analysis of our data."
"9516276","PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal unites complementary analytical expertise of Mayo Clinic and University of Wisconsin in pursuit of the goal of charting a molecular map of physical activity (PA). The overall goal of the Mayo Clinic Center for Metabolomics and Proteomics (MCCMAPS) is to apply state-of-the-art metabolomics and proteomics approaches to the MoTrPAC samples. We propose a metabolomics workflow that begins with untargeted profiling to identify candidate metabolites. From there, annotated metabolites will be validated, and unknown metabolites will be identified through a combination of novel compound synthesis, MS/MS data and NMR spectroscopy structural elucidation. The important metabolites that emerge from untargeted profiling will guide subsequent targeted quantitative metabolite measurements in plasma and tissue samples. We propose a proteomics workflow that includes global quantitative proteomics in muscle, adipose, and exosomes and assessment of posttranslational modifications using phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and indices of oxidative modifications. Global, discovery proteomics will guide targeted, quantitative proteomics of salient proteins in plasma (e.g., irisin, myostatin). Our peptide synthesis capabilities allows for custom synthesis of any stable isotope labeled peptides for standards for quantitation. In addition, we will measure stable isotope enrichment of labeled amino acids in plasma, muscle compartments, and individual skeletal muscle proteins thus offering an insight on how PA influences amino acid kinetics, protein metabolism, and translation of gene transcripts to individual proteins. Isotopic enrichment of lipids in plasma and tissues will enable measurements of fatty acid kinetics in response to PA. Advanced statistical methods will fuse proteomics and metabolomics data to generate molecular concept maps of PA. Here we propose to leverage a productive ongoing collaboration between metabolomics and proteomics experts at Mayo and University of Wisconsin as a single integrated analytical resource dedicated to uncovering molecular signatures of PA. Our goal is to not only contribute our analytical expertise, but also contribute our knowledge of muscle and adipose tissue biology to the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)."
"9449962","Abstract  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the leading life-threatening malignancy in American men and is disproportionally  higher in African Americans (AAs) than other ethnic populations, underscoring a need to decode the  underlying mechanism and to develop new and effective therapies to cure PCa. Despite androgen-  deprivation therapy, relapse occurs in many PCa patients who eventually still die. The initiation and  progression of PCa are driven by dysregulation of multiple oncogenic pathways secondary to genetic and  epigenetic alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. PTEN (phosphatase and tension homolog  deleted on chromosome ten) is frequently deleted and/or mutated in various human cancers. Loss of PTEN  leads to cancers with the aberration of AKT-mTOR, SKP2, TGF-?, and androgen receptor (AR) signaling  pathways. KDM5B (lysine demethylase 5B, also named JARID1B), a JmjC domain- containing H3K4 histone  demethylase, activates the gene expression of FOXA1, a crucial co-factor for AR function and signaling.  Aberrant elevation of KDM5B is often found in human cancers including advanced PCa. FOXA1 mutation is  4-fold higher in AA PCa samples as compared to Caucasian American (CA) PCa samples, underscoring the  importance of KDM5B/FOXA1 in PCa disparities. However, the mechanism and contributions of KDM5B to  prostate tumorigenesis remain elusive. We recently demonstrated that KDM5B is noticeably increased in  prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice, and that its levels are regulated by SKP2 and TRAF6 through  ubiquitination. Our preliminary data reveal that KDM5B is higher in AA PCa samples than in CA PCa  samples. In addition, PTEN loss results in an increase of KDM5B in mice, and KDM5B knockout (KO)  decreased the levels of FOXA1 and AR in PCa cells. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will investigate the role of  KDM5B in PTEN-null driven prostate tumorigenesis. With application of genetically-engineered mouse  models, we will generate Pten/Kdm5b double mutants from Pten and Kdm5b mice, and define the effects of  Kdm5b deficiency on the suppression of tumor progression in Pten-null mice. In aim 2, we will investigate the  molecular mechanisms of KDM5B signaling network in prostate cancer. We will define KDM5B target gene  by ChIP assay, KDM5B ubiquitination and mutation, its regulation by PTEN-AKT, SKP2 and TRAF6, and the  relevance of KDM5B modification on EZH2, FOXA1, and AR signaling pathways using human PCa cell lines  (PC3, LNCaP, C4-2B, and MDA PCa 2b). In aim 3, we will assess the effects of KDM5B inhibition on PCa  growth of C4-2B and MDA PCa 2b cells, and its implications on PCa disparities. We will evaluate the impact  of KDM5B KO and inhibition with compounds on the suppression of prostate tumor growth in xenografts and  Luc/Pten mice. Results from this proposal should provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of  epigenetic alterations in PCa, and a potential development of a novel therapeutic strategy to control PCa  growth. This study should bring great benefit to all PCa patients and reduce/eliminate cancer disparities."
"9355136","Technical Abstract In any population, with the presence of more than 100 genetic determinants, most breast cancer cases are likely to carry one, yet community occurrence is dominated by non-genetic risk factors. Adult identical twin women are representative of the population of origin in both genetic and non-genetic factors. However, when one gets breast cancer, the lifetime risk to the co-twin is much higher than expected on the basis of risk to an ordinary sister. Even so, only about a quarter of such co-twins become affected, and those that are become diagnosed years later. Thus affected pairs, whether breast cancer discordant or concordant, differ in the level of penetrance, and since the genetic determinants carried by concordant cases are unlikely to differ from those in discordant cases, the difference between such affected pairs, given the same genetic determinants, also reflects a different level of penetrance. We propose to verify the identity of genetic determinants between discordant and concordant pairs (using the Illumina OncoArray 500K), and to document the existence and timing of exogenous determinants of higher penetrance. This will be within discordant pairs, between the members of concordant pairs differing in age at diagnosis, and between cases from discordant and concordant pairs with the same or similar genotype. We will use adult twins' documented ability to accurately recall childhood differences between themselves in behaviors, environmental exposures, and given currant emphasis on adolescence, the rate of development. We will also use the Illumina HM450K BeadArray to evaluate whether the reported global hypo-methylation of WBCs from cases is attributable to the high risk genotype, and whether it persists after successful treatment.

"9347383","ABSTRACT Surgeons performing complex vascular surgeries such as aneurysm clipping or vascular anastomoses could benefit if instantaneous information on blood flow in their surgical field was made available to them. Current technologies that can monitor blood flow at high resolution either engage complex dedicated equipment or rely on administration of contrast agents, both of which are disruptive to the surgical procedure and hence, undesired. We propose a novel method that can noninvasively provide real-time information about blood flow in the surgeon?s field of view at the spatial scale of microvessels. This modular optical imaging system (called the SurgeONTM) will integrate with existing surgical microscopes in operating rooms providing the surgeon-user an on-demand video feed of blood flow information to assist in surgical decision-making. This complementary blood flow information will be obtained using proprietary and licensed laser speckle contrast imaging technology, and optionally presented to the surgeon in his/her visual field overlaid on the region of interest. During Phase I, we assembled a preclinical prototype and successfully demonstrated proof of concept in rodent models of brain and femoral vasculature. Our proposed Phase II project aims to develop novel features that significantly amplify the utility of the device for microsurgical applications, and perform a robust validation of the system in large animal models. We anticipate the results of our Phase II project to facilitate submission of performance data to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for market clearance."
"9397322","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on ? and preferably at neonatal ages ? is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments ? before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur."
"9565088","The pathogenesis of the chronic bronchitis component of pulmonary diseases, defined by chronic cough and sputum production, is not well understood. Despite the bronchitic features of CF, PCD, COPD, and asthma, there has been a general inability to relate changes in mucus properties to disease pathogenesis. The absence of an adequate formulation to describe mucus transport and health, and predict the failure of mucus transport in disease, has limited our knowledge in this area. A novel topographical description of airway mucus the (?gel on brush? model), coupled with a novel application of polymer physics concepts, has been applied to the local biophysical processes that govern mucus flow in health and the failure to flow in disease. However, a full description of the mucus clearance system and health and disease requires a more global/multi-scaled description of mucin/mucus biology in the lung. At one length scale, we need to understand the integration of mucin secretion and flow in different regions of the lung and how secretions from glands and superficial epithelia are admixed in proximal airways to maintain basal flow and respond to irritants by cough. At another length scale, we need to know why mucins require their gigantic size and how these very large molecules are released and integrated into the local airway surface liquid environment. We have selected four key gaps in our understanding of the mucociliary system for investigation. These gaps constitute our four specific aims. Specific Aim 1 How is mucin secretion organized intraregionally in superficial epithelia and proximally with submucosal gland secretion? This aim will test the hypothesis that a new paradigm for mucin secretion in the lung is required, focusing on the role of basal MUC5B secretion in the distal airways (rather than proximal airway glands) in the lung. Specific Aim 2: Are there functional differences in mucus secreted by superficial epithelia vs glands? This aim will test the hypothesis that the mucins secreted by superficial epithelial constitute a ?reversible? gel that dissolves into the local ASL environment whereas mucin secreted from glands constitute a ?permanent? gel configured for plug-like flow/coughability. Specific Aim 3: How are mucins released from granules onto the airway surface? This aim will attempt to distinguish between the hypotheses that are mucins are released in response to an electrostatic Na+ for Ca2+ entropic exchange mechanism vs a HCO-3/pH +/- protease dependent mechanism. Specific Aim 4: Why are mucins organized into gigantic (>100MD) higher-order multimers? The hypotheses tested are that gigantic molecules are required to generate mucus gels with biophysical properties commensurate with transport in dilute solutions and that such large molecules impose unique cell biologic packaging constraints on the cell. Importantly, resolution of the questions/hypotheses generated by this analysis of ?gaps? in knowledge of the MCC system may lead to paradigm shifts in our understanding of normal MCC and how to approach novel therapies for bronchitic diseases.

"9457764","Abstract Mechano-activation of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca2+) signaling has been widely reported in diverse cell types, including skeletal muscle. We are now investigating the mechanisms by which mechano-activated ROS and Ca2+ influence the physiology of normal muscle, as well as the pathophysiology following their dysregulation in muscular dystrophy. This proposal builds upon our recent provocative discovery and characterization of X-ROS signaling which suggested that many critical elements of mechano-signaling arise from the microtubules, their mechano-activation of NADPH oxidase type 2 (NoX2) ROS production (i.e., X-ROS), and its subsequent activation of sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels. We demonstrated that acutely targeting X-ROS components provided a therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical models of muscular dystrophy. Based on our previous research, we have devised a set of specific aims, using both control and genetically altered mice, which will extend our previous discoveries and further characterize the physiologic relevance of X-ROS signaling. The proposed single cell studies are enabled by state-of-the-art techniques, including many newly devised within the laboratory, that allow simultaneous measurements of force, intracellular [Ca2+], Ca2+ influx, and [ROS]i while controlling sarcomere length. These, combined with advanced biochemistry and immunofluorescence, allow the advancement of relevant findings to in vitro whole muscle and in vivo animal studies designed to inform future pre-clinical efficacy studies."
"9464319","ABSTRACT Owing to the adverse impact of vitamin D deficiency on the skeleton and risk of skin cancer associated with prolonged cutaneous exposure to sunlight, oral supplementation with vitamin D3 or D2 has been widely accepted and promoted as the mode of achieving and maintaining calcium homeostasis in children and adults. Given recent appreciation of the profound affect that the gut microbiome has on host human health and disease, with support of this supplement we will be performing the first pilot study to compare and contrast the impact of the most widely used oral vitamin D supplement (vitamin D3) versus the more rapidly acting, experimental 25-hydroxylated metabolite, 25D3, on the gut-residing microbes that have the first opportunity to encounter and respond to those vitamin D metabolites. With support from this supplement, we wish to take advantage of the still-recruiting, multi-ethnic vitamin D replacement trial comparing oral administration of vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D3) in vitamin D deficient subjects (total serum 25D ?20 ng/ml) set forth in Specific Aim 3 of the parent grant R01AR063910. This application includes a plan for supplemental analysis of the gut microbiome in those subjects before and after normalization of total and free serum 25D. We propose that i) there will exist predictable changes in the taxomic 16S rRNA-sequencing profiles of the stool microbiota and 2) the impact of that altered bacterial microbiome on the host's skeletal and immune homeostasis that will be conditioned by the form of vitamin D supplementation and the host's ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian). These new analyses will i) compliment the already-funded program's novel assay technology for determining serum free 25D and 1,25D and ii) further advance our definition of `personalized' vitamin D health in terms of both classical (bone) and non-classical (immune) actions of vitamin D. !"
"9409833","Abstract CellSight is a clinical stage company developing PET imaging tools that can increase the probability of clinical success of immunotherapies by determining early in the therapeutic regimen if the cancer patient is responding to their immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to help fight cancer do not work for everyone; in fact, success rates can be as low as 20%. This means that up to 80% of patients undergoing immunotherapy are spending over $100,000 and investing 6 to 10 months on ineffective treatments. Our lead imaging tracer, [18F]-FAraG product named VisAcT, leverages existing health and PET imaging infrastructure but is specific for visualizing immune response. This whole body visualization will provide clinicians critical information to help make early decisions in the treatment regimen and increase chances of patient survival. CellSight is partnering with pharma and academia on various projects to validate this critically needed immune response monitoring tool as immunotherapies and combinational therapies are showing great promise. The sheer number of combinations are staggering yet there are no blood biomarkers or imaging tools available that can be predictive of responders versus nonresponders. Even if accurate blood biomarkers were to became available in the near future, whole body imaging will still be critically needed to determine local immune response site by site in the metastatic patient who are the ones being administered immunotherapies. Clinical symptoms during immunotherapy are very perplexing, as it might seem a patient is progressing when in fact their immune system is actively fighting the cancer or there might be a delay before immune response is apparent through traditional measures. An immune response monitoring tool, such as VisAcT, will be key in enabling success for immunotherapies. VisAcT was first discovered and developed in the Gambhir lab (Chair of Radiology at Stanford) and is exclusively licensed to CellSight. CellSight has obtained an IND primarily through funding from the NCI. We are currently conducting Phase 1 clinical trials at University of California San Francisco for various solid tumors including Melanoma, Lung and Bladder under Drs, Daud, Gubens and Fong respectively and are about to launch a Head/Neck cancer trial at Stanford under Dr. Colevas. Our primary target market is the immuno-oncology market however since the tracer shows immune response that is specific to activated T cells it can be useful for other immune modulated diseases such as Graft vs Host Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis."
"9524669","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the late phase of HIV-1 infection, the Gag protein is synthesized and folds in the cytoplasm into an assembly inactive form in which not only the nucleocapsid (NC) domain but also the matrix (MA) domain interacts with RNA. As a consequence of this folded conformation, the capsid (CA) domain becomes incapable of assembling. During or upon transport to the plasma membrane (PM) site of assembly, a conformational switch occurs in which the interaction of MA with NC is exchanged for an interaction of MA with PM components. This switch liberates the CA domains for assembly and this conformational rearrangement, essential for activation of Gag, is driven by the binding affinity of specific PM components for MA. To understand this essential switch, it is fundamentally important to elucidate at the molecular level the interaction of MA with PM components. Interestingly, the Gag proteins of closely related retroviruses such as avian sarcoma virus (ASV) contain structural domains with functions essentially identical to those of HIV-1 Gag; however, the mechanisms for Gag assembly on the PM appear to be different. Understanding the molecular basis of this switch will not only shed light on the assembly of HIV-1 but is likely to provide insight into the control of assembly in other retroviruses that assemble at the PM. Subsequent to assembly on the PM, the Gag proteins recruit the envelope (Env) protein for incorporation into virus particles. There is mounting evidence that incorporation of th Env protein in nascent virions is mediated by interactions between the MA domain of Gag and the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of gp41. The mechanism by which Gag mediates Env incorporation is not known. In this proposal, we will employ NMR, biophysical, biochemical and in vivo tools to provide a macromolecular picture of how the Gag protein binds to the PM, and to determine the molecular elements for Gag-gp41 interactions that mediate Env incorporation into virus particles. In Aim 1, we will determine the precise molecular mechanism for HIV-1 Gag binding to the PM. We have devised innovative approaches to characterize interactions between MA and membrane mimetics. In Aim 2, we will identify the molecular elements of ASV Gag assembly on the PM. We present evidence for a novel molecular switch in ASV MA upon binding to PM components. In Aim 3, we will characterize the interactions between HIV-1 MA and gp41 CT. We devised a new strategy to reconstitute and mimic the physiologically relevant conditions for interactions. These studies will provide details on the molecular switches that activate Gag assembly on the PM and help in the recruitment of the Env protein to assembly sites. We hope that the outcome of this proposal will help in the development of new antiviral therapeutic agents that inhibit assembly and virus production."
"9311531","SUMMARY  Alcohol use disorder is estimated to affect 17 million Americans, with great costs to the individual and to society. Although available therapies and counseling can be effective in some drinkers, long-term recovery remains difficult to achieve. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a peptide that has both hormone and neurotransmitter functions. It is produced in the digestive tract and regulates blood sugar and food intake, and GLP-1 receptor agonists are used clinically to manage type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 is also produced in the brain, and GLP-1 receptors are expressed in brain regions important in addictions, such as the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens. Emerging evidence suggests that one or more GLP-1 receptor variants are associated with alcohol use disorder and modulate effects of ethanol in humans, and that GLP- 1 receptor agonists can reduce ethanol intake in rodents. The long-term goal of this research, in a collaboration spanning molecular and behavioral studies in laboratory animals to a clinical trial, is to validate and optimize GLP-1 receptor agonists as a treatment approach for alcohol use disorders. The goal for the present studies is to understand how GLP-1 receptor agonists modulate alcohol use, at a circuit/mechanism level. Aim 1 is to identify the GLP-1 receptor populations necessary and sufficient to mediate decreases in ethanol intake, using microinfusions of the GLP-1 receptor agonist Exendin-4 or the GLP-1 receptor antagonist Exendin(9-39) into the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, paraventricular region of the hypothalamus, or central region of the amygdala in mice. Systemic administration of Exendin-4, and of a non-brain penetrant Exendin-4 fusion molecule, will be evaluated for comparison. GLP-1 receptor ligands modulate food and fluid intake, making it difficult to separate effects on ethanol seeking specifically from effects on consummatory behaviors generally. Therefore, the present studies will make use of intravenous ethanol self-administration as a non-oral assay of ethanol reinforcement, as well as of a drinking relapse assay. Aim 2 is to determine the effects of Exendin-4 treatment on ethanol-induced neuronal activity, both acute and persistent changes induced by ethanol intake. This aim will use immunohistochemical detection of the immediate early gene c-Fos as a marker of neuronal activity, in brain slices from mice allowed to self- administer ethanol intravenously for at least three weeks, or to drink ethanol daily for at least four weeks. Control groups will self-administer saline and drink only water, respectively. In striatal tissues, c-Fos expression will also be evaluated at the cellular level, distinguishing between direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons by use of transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent reporter in specific neuron types. Blood ethanol levels will be determined in all experimental groups."
"9565791","Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. but 300,000 babies are born with SCD every year globally. 11% of these children will have a major stroke by age 16, and up to 35% will have a silent stroke, affecting cognitive regions of the brain. Elastic lamina fragmentation in the cerebral arteries were hallmarks identified in autopsy specimens of children with SCD, but mechanisms behind this accelerated arterial remodeling in these children are not known and therefore cannot be prevented. Cysteine cathepsins are powerful proteases implicated in elastin degradation in cardiovascular disease (i.e. atherosclerosis), and our previous studies demonstrated that when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from people living with SCD adhered to endothelial cells, they significantly increased cathepsin K (catK) activity compared to wildtype PBMCs. This is highly suggestive of a role for cysteine cathepsins in SCD arterial remodeling and strokes, but a major gap remains between proteolytic mechanisms of arterial remodeling and the cellular and inflammatory processes unique to SCD. Our long term goal is to identify therapeutic targets to inhibit proteolytic activity and accelerated elastin degradation in children and adults with SCD. The overall objective of this application is to determine the roles and regulatory mechanisms behind cathepsin mediated arterial remodeling in SCD, and then mitigate arterial damage to prevent strokes. Our central hypothesis is that catK accelerates elastic lamina degradation that precedes strokes in SCD, and catK is induced by inflammatory monocyte signaling, endothelial cells, and interactions between these two via cytokines and microparticle generation. To test this, we will use the Towne's mouse model of sickle cell anemia and the following aims: Aim 1. Determine the role of cathepsins in accelerated elastic lamina degradation due to SCD, and test the efficacy of blocking elastin fragmentation with cathepsin K inhibitors and pathways upstream of cathepsin K expression. Aim 2. Determine cellular mechanisms of SCD-mediated induction of cathepsins in arteries. Aim 3. Determine role of cathepsins in SCD-mediated strokes using assays developed to monitor spontaneous micro-infarcts in young animals using both immunohistochemical methods, but also with the design goal of optimizing 9.4 Tesla MRI scans to quantify stroke lesion number and size. This work is significant because its success will identify novel pharmaceutical treatments to preserve the integrity of carotid and cerebral arteries and to prevent pediatric strokes in people with SCD. Cathepsin inhibitors are already highly sought after products by pharmaceutical companies and identification of cathepsin inhibition as treatment will provide a non-transfusion based drug to prevent SCD strokes in children at risk. Innovative aspects of this project include: 1) Studying arterial complications of SCD, 2) implicating cysteine cathepsins in SCD, a family of enzymes that have been previously unexplored in this context, 3) developing MRI protocols to monitor spontaneous strokes in sickle cell transgenic mice."
"9431483","Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD."
"9406651","Abstract.  Conventional asthma therapies are often ineffective for patients with severe and exacerbation-prone asthma, conditions accounting for up to half of the morbidity, mortality and economic burden of asthma. We and others have identified subsets of these patients (endotypes) for whom there are treatable mechanisms contributing to airflow obstruction. The investigators in our proposal have collaborated for the nearly two decades to define the biology of severe and exacerbation prone endotypes. We have also developed biomarkers that will likely predict response to therapy targeted specifically to each endotype. Many of these biomarker/endotype pairs may ultimately be studied by the PrecISE consortium. Here, we have focused on treating three of these that our data suggests will overlap minimally with one another and will be safe, effective and cost-saving. These are 1) urinary bromotyrosine to identify the 70% of eosinophilic patients for whom ant-IL5 will be effective; 2) serum superoxide dismutase activity to identify patients who will respond to oral Coenzyme Q; and 3) serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate to identify patients who will respond to oral DHEA. We propose to use an adaptive trial design to test and improve the predictive and response biomarkers for all three endotypes. These studies fit into the framework of a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) or equivalent, where each patient will start an initial treatment based on the baseline biomarker profile, followed by re- assignment of non-responders to other treatments at each subsequent stage (Figure 1). Our key objectives are summarized by three Aims. Precision treatment Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that Anti-Interleukin 5 (Mepolizumab) will decrease eosinophil activation as measured by urine bromotyrosine (BrTyr) in the Th2-high severe asthmatic patient and consequently improve lung function and asthma control. Precision treatment Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that CoQ supplementation will restore the antioxidant capacity and reducing-oxidizing balance in severe asthmatic patients with decreased serum SOD activity, and will consequently improve lung function and asthma control. Precision treatment Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that DHEA supplementation will improve FEV1, asthma control and DHEAS levels in older women and younger male adolescents with SA and EPA .To accomplish these Aims, we plan to participate in the PrecISE network, enrolling 100 subjects with severe and/or exacerbation prone asthma. These will include both children (12-18) and adults, reflecting our longstanding Pediatric/adult collaboration.

It is also the most common of the primary malignant brain tumors, which are the most frequent cause of cancer death in children and young adults. In contrast to current therapy which is limited by off-target toxicity, immunotherapy promises an exquisitely precise approach, and substantial evidence indicates that, if appropriately redirected, T cells can eradicate large, well established tumors.  We have developed a novel bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) that effectively tethers CD3+ T cells to the surface of tumor cells that express the tumor-specific epidermal growth factor receptor mutation, EGFRvIII. Our first EGFRvIII-CD3 BiTE eradicated well-established EGFRvIIIPOS human GBM in a xenograft model reconstituted with human T cells without evidence of autoimmune toxicity. Based on these data, we developed a developed a EGFRvIII-CD3 BiTE from fully-human antibody segments, increasing clinical safety by drastically reducing the potential for immunogenicity. Because all available antibodies specific for human CD3 do not cross-react with any other species including primates, we have rederived a unique, pharmacologically responsive, immunocompetent, human CD3 transgenic murine model that will allow for direct assessment of the humanized BiTE destine for clinical trial, drastically increasing the validity and translatability of pre-clinical efficacy and toxicity studis.  Our overall goal is to translate the BiTE therapeutic platform for safe, effective immunotherapy in patients with EGFRvIII-expressing GBM. In this proposal, we seek to perform Investigational New Drug (IND) required experiments, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has outlined to us in our formal Pre-IND meeting. The in vitro cytoxicity and in vivo efficacy of the lead human construct, shown to bind to both targets, will be validated in Aim 1. Aim 2 will complete the necessary optimization of protocols for current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production of the lead human construct and will yield a sufficient quantity for IND-enabling studies. Aim 3 will document the activity and pharmacokinetics of the cGMP drug product, producing information critical in determining the first-in-man dose. Formal toxicology and stability testing will be completed in Aim 4, allowing for assessment of any potential off-target activity and guiding manufacturing timelines for clinical trial respectively. The sum total of data generated in this proposal, as requested by the FDA during our Pre-IND meeting, will be used to assemble the necessary documents and file an IND application with the FDA in Aim 5."
"9408298","Heavy alcohol drinking and HIV-1 infection are independently associated with the development of abnormalities in the brain function and cognition, and increasing evidence indicates that the combinatorial effects of HIV infection and alcohol are likely to worsen these abnormalities. Significantly, both HIV- 1 infection and chronic alcohol abuse cause alterations in gut microbiome (dysbiosis) and increase intestinal permeability and microbial translocation (MT) which are major pathogenic factors driving local and systemic inflammation. The dysbiosis is characterized by loss of gut bacterial biodiversity, a reduction in beneficial bacteria, and/or an expansion of harmful or pro-inflammatory bacteria. However, there is limited understanding of (i) the interactive effects of heavy alcohol drinking and HIV-1 infection on gut dysbiosis and (ii) the longitudinal qualitative (microbial membership) and quantitative (relevant abundance) determinants of dysbiosis. The current proposal addresses these gaps with an overall goal to promote the development of rational therapies targeting gut dysbiosis. Accordingly, we pursue a unifying hypothesis that in HIV-infected individuals, heavy alcohol use compounds gut dysbiosis and consequent peripheral immune inflammation leading to exacerbation of neuro- inflammation and cognitive dysfunction. To test these hypotheses, we will enroll 100 HIV+ participants from ?30-to-90-day challenge? Florida SHARC study (AA020797). This is a funded prospective cohort study in which enrolled heavy drinkers are challenged to stop drinking for 30 to 90 days, assisted by contingency management (CM) payments and motivational interviewing. This application, Alcohol associated Comorbidities and Microbiome Evaluation in HIV (ACME HIV 2/2) leverages the existing resources of ?30-to-90-day challenge? Florida SHARC study: participant recruitment, measures of alcohol consumption, biospecimen and biomarker collection; expertise in alcohol, HIV and neuroimaging. New data include: longitudinal changes in gut dysbiosis, correlative changes in peripheral inflammation, and measures of cognition and neuroinflammation. In response to RFA-AA-17-014, we will partner with the St. PETER HIV study (ACME HIV 1/2) to corroborate our findings in Aims 1 and 2 and to conduct combined cross-cohort analyses. We will complete the following Specific Aims among HIV+ heavy drinkers: AIM 1: To assess longitudinal qualitative and quantitative changes in the gut microbiome (dysbiosis) associated with very heavy alcohol consumption. AIM 2: To determine the impact of HIV infection and alcohol abuse induced gut dysbiosis on intestinal permeability, microbial translocation (MT), and resultant peripheral endotoxemia, immune activation and inflammation. AIM 3: To investigate the impact of dysbiosis and peripheral inflammation on development of neuro-inflammation and cognitive function. Completion of these aims will lay groundwork for an intervention targeting alcohol-associated dysbiosis, which could profoundly reduce inflammation and improve cognitive functions in HIV+ heavy drinkers."

"9403151","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Here we seek to investigate components directly involved in activation of Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), an endoplasmic reticulum trans-membrane protein that is responsible for key events in immunopathogenesis of early alcoholic liver disease. Activation of STING leads to phosphorylation of Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3), a transcription factor that plays an important role in the activation of innate immunity and in activation pro-apoptotic signaling in hepatocytes after ethanol administration. In immune cells, STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides. 2'3'-cGAMP is a mammalian cyclic dinucleotide synthesized by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), an intracellular dsDNA sensor. c-di-GMP, the bacterial dinucleotide, is synthesized by diguanylate cyclase (DGC) in over 90% of bacteria. Recently, cyclic dinucleotides have been shown to pass from cell to cell through gap junctions. We have previously reported that mice deficient in STING or IRF3 are protected from alcoholic liver disease. Here, we show that mice deficient in cGAS are protected from acute or acute-on-chronic ethanol-induced liver injury and phosphorylation of IRF3. We also show that pharmacological inhibition of hepatic gap junctions protects from acute or acute-on-chronic ethanol-induced liver injury. We show evidence that both mammalian and bacterial cyclic dinucleotides are capable of activation STING and IRF3 in primary hepatocytes. Lastly, we show that gap junctions propagate ethanol-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 to neighboring cells in vitro. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that cyclic dinucleotides from the host animal and gut microbiome converge in activation of STING and IRF3 in early alcoholic liver disease. The aims proposed as part of this research proposal encompass basic molecular biology, analytical chemistry, as well as the use of small-molecule inhibitors and viral vector-mediated gene transfer technology as therapeutic interventions in two models of early alcoholic liver disease in mice. The main objectives can be summarized as follows: 1. Detect and quantify mammalian and bacterial cyclic dinucleotides in serum, whole liver lysate after  ethanol-induced liver injury. 2. Study the spatiotemporal dynamics of gap junction-mediated cyclic dinucleotides that lead to ethanol-  induced STING and IRF3 activation in the liver. 3. Characterize the potential of bacterial diguanylate cyclase and its associated cyclic dinucleotides as  viable therapeutic targets in the treatment of early alcoholic liver disease using small-molecule  inhibitors and/or adeno-associated virus associated gene therapy.

"9274516","PROJECT SUMMARY  This application requests funding to purchase a General Electric Healthcare SPINlab? Carbon-13 (C13) polarizer needed to expand our molecular imaging capability by initiating a new hyperpolarized carbon-13 (HP-C13) metabolic imaging program. This state-of-the-art C13 polarizer is the only dynamic nuclear polarizer capable of producing large amounts of HP-C13 substrates suitable for animals of various sizes, and the only one equipped with sterile operations for potential clinical applications. Two nearest SPINlab systems are located 210 miles away in New York. Thus the proposed C13 polarizer will be an invaluable resource for the rich body of bi-directional translational research at the Martinos Center and the larger MGH research community, as well as at other institutions in New England.  Providing more than a 10,000-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to thermal equilibrium 13C nuclei, hyperpolarized MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) forms an important bridge between MRI and molecular imaging. Metabolic MRSI using HP-C13 substrates allows objective measures of the injected substrate and its metabolic products to track key metabolic pathways, a novel imaging technique for dynamic in vivo detection of metabolism in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The potential of HP-C13 metabolic imaging has been demonstrated in preclinical studies of a range of diseases, as well as in clinical trials of prostate cancer patients. The proposed polarizer will enable sophisticated metabolic imaging studies of cancer, traumatic brain injury, and heart diseases, by our users, while ensuring the successful development of this promising technique for years to come.  The proposed C13 polarizer will be located within the MGH Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, which operates as a NCRR-funded National Research Resource, supplying state-of- the-art molecular imaging instrumentation and services to MGH and the broader research community nationwide. The Martinos Center has a renowned molecular imaging program, consistently producing successes with every new modality that has been incorporated into our program, such as MEG, PET, Nano-particle MRI and Optical Imaging. With the same rigor and dedication, we anticipate the successful development of a new HP-C13 metabolic imaging program. The proposed instrument will be used with the existing PET-MR systems for HP-C13 metabolic imaging research. Therefore, by offering the usage of the proposed C13 polarizer to researchers across New England, we are also sharing our advanced pre-clinical and clinical MRI as well as PET resources to our users throughout the region."
"9546177","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone grafting is currently the gold standard for filling in massive skeletal defects. However, once a bone graft is infected by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) a common pathogen, infection is very difficult to treat due to the lack of vascularity and perfusion for antimicrobial bioavailability. Bone graft infection results in not ony microbial habitation, but also triggers innate immune inflammatory cytokine storms. Inflammation is meant to repel pathogens but excessive inflammation destroys bone just as the Ebola viral infection through a series of cytokine storms destroys its host. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is pushing to minimize infection, one of the most important 'Quality and Safety' indicators. Therefore, there is a desperate need for developing a new strategy to prevent or reduce bone graft-associated infections. Our proposal formulates a therapeutic application of bisphosphonate-conjugated nano-micro-size-bubbles (BNB) that can load vancomycin and inflammatory kinase inhibitors for the treatment of MRSA bone graft infections. Technically, we optimized drug loading, release-kinetics, bone attachment, and the bactericidal effect of BNB. From a mechanism perspective, microarray, protein kinase array, and confirmatory RT-PCR showed MRSA- induction of inflammatory-osteoclastogenic cytokine storms that were primarily mediated by pERK1/2 in MRSA-infected osteoblasts. Osx-Cre;DN MEK1 mice with defective ERK1/2 phosphorylation in osteoblasts or AZD 6244 (a clinical grade MEK1-ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor) treatments exhibited suppressed innate inflammatory response and osteoclastogenesis in response to bacterial toxins or MRSA in vivo and in vitro. We posit a central hypothesis that vancomycin+AZD6244-loaded BNB reduce post-operative bone infections and inflammatory graft resorption following MRSA infection. Three Specific Aims are Aim 1 (Anti-Microbial Technology): To establish the efficacy of drug-loaded-BNB grafts to prevent infection and innate immune inflammatory reaction against MRSA infection in vitro; Aim 2 (Mechanism): To determine a role of pERK1/2 in MRSA-induced cytokine storms by osteoblasts and subsequent inflammation-associated bone loss in vitro and in vivo; and Aim 3 (Pre-Clinical Translation): To establish a new preventive & therapeutic regimen concurrently treating MRSA infection and inflammation with BNB in an animal model of infected bone grafting. We will conduct a series of mechanistic experiments using a clinical-grade pERK1/2 inhibitor and Osx-Cre;DN MEK1 mice with defective ERK1/2 phosphorylation regarding mRNA expression of RANKL, MCSF, TNF, IL-1b, IL-6 in MRSA-infected human and murine osteoblasts in vitro. We will conduct clinically relevant intercalary femoral bone grafting experiments in mice and determine whether vancomycin + AZD-BNB prevents or reduces infection and excessive inflammation following MRSA-infected bone grating by analyzing radiographs, microCT, histology, and biomechanical testing data. The proposed technique and therapeutic concepts may be extended to prevent or treat other types of bone or bio-implant infections and bacterial strains with high impact."
"9370687","The overall goal of the CWRU Psoriasis Center of Research Translation (CORT) is to combine new  bioinformatic methodologies with advanced murine and human experimental approaches to translate scientific  findings into clinical applications that more nimbly advance therapy for psoriasis and related inflammatory  comorbidities. Our highly innovative, synergistic and cross-disciplinary CORT will use a collaborative research  project (CRP) as a central hub with bi-directional input from 2 highly interactive research cores, to refine and  test hypotheses, identify and test repurposed drug leads and advance understanding of psoriasis and related  inflammatory comorbidities. To do so, the CRP will integrate input from the: 1) Preclinical Modeling Core  (PMC), that will provide and customize our many validated, unique transgenic psoriasiform animal models and  translatable human xenograft approaches, essential to translating new mediator/pathway roles and drug leads;  and the 2) Applied Meta-?Omics Core (AMC), that will apply multi-platform (transcriptome, metabolome,  micro/mycobiome) bioinformatics to individual patient and murine samples to identify novel pathway-specific  targets. Iterative experimental testing of these targets and feedback from the PMC and CRP will identify novel  pathways in psoriasis pathogenesis that are likely to benefit from intervention by new or repurposed drugs that  will translate to psoriasis therapy. Our overarching hypothesis is that we can powerfully combine existing and  developing psoriasis basic science datasets, patient records, bioinformatics and computational systems  biology with bi-directional mouse and human studies to identify new therapeutic targets and repurposed drugs  that can be expeditiously moved to clinical trials, improving psoriasis treatment and patient care. To test and  refine this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are: (1) Identify new pathways central to psoriasis pathogenesis and  new psoriasis drug candidates by analyzing psoriasis patients' EMR data, tissue and blood samples and; (2)  Evaluate AMC-identified gene targets and efficacy of pathway-specific drug candidates using preclinical  molecular genetic psoriasis mouse models. The concentrated interactions between the CRP and Cores will  provide value-added research output, far beyond any incremental advances that a given Core or specific  project could provide. Our novel, highly integrated and synergistic CORT design, powered by exceptional  resources and expertise of our interdisciplinary translational investigative team, will exert a transformative and  sustainable impact on the psoriasis field and patient care."
"9374698","EM/PROTECT Study Abstract Elder mistreatment afflicts up to 10% of adults 60 years and older. Approximately 1/3 of victims have clinically significant depressive symptoms. We developed EM/PROTECT, a behavioral intervention for depressed EM victims to work in synergy with EM mistreatment resolution services that provide safety planning, support services, and linkages to legal services. PROTECT is built on a model, which postulates that chronic stress promotes dysfunction of the cognitive control (CCN) and the reward networks impairing the victims' ability to flexibly respond to the environment and limits their rewarding activities. EM/PROTECT utilizes simple to use mobile technology to support the victim's action plans, help therapists to target their sessions, and track mood, stress and social interaction. EM/PROTECT has been designed in an iterative process with community EM providers of the NYC Department for the Aging (DFTA) to use agencies' routine PHQ-9 depression screening and referral for services. This project will examine the reach, feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of EM/PROTECT with the goal of building a sustainable mental health program that can be broadly implemented. Our primary hypotheses postulate that victims who receive EM services and PROTECT therapy (EM/PROTECT) will have greater reduction in depression and improvement in quality of life compared to victims who receive EM Services and a mental health referral (EM-MH). We propose that reductions in stress will mediate the differential impact of EM/PROTECT. With two NYC EM agencies, we will develop procedures for PHQ-9 screening, hand-off, linkages, consent process, tracking of EM actions, and clinical progress. EM victims will be recruited from two randomly assigned EM agencies that will yield a sample of 60 subjects (40 EM/PROTECT and 20 EM-MH). Research assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6, 9 and 12 weeks to evaluate depression, quality of Life, chronic stress, rewarding activities and incidents of financial, physical and psychological abuse and neglect. We will assess reach by recording the rates of screening, identified depressed victims, referrals to each condition, refusal and lack of follow-through; feasibility of EM/PROTECT will be based on drop-out, completion of assessments, and use of smartphones; and acceptability will be based on client satisfaction. We will analyze measures of effectiveness in separate linear mixed models with a subject-specific random intercept and slope and fixed effects for time, treatment, and EM agency. The results of this project will be used to support an R01 application to formally test the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, non-billable costs, and barriers to implementation of PROTECT in in a rigorous randomized controlled trial. We plan to conduct the trial with EM agencies nationwide."
"9416014","OVERVIEW: Project Summary A comprehensive understanding of how neural circuits spanning the entire brain generate the full repertoire of perception and behaviors requires a list of brain cell types, as well the means to target each cell type in order to interrogate the functional interactions that give rise to the emergent properties of the whole system. To address these challenges, the ?Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas? (CEMBA) will focus on ?epigenetic profiling?, for identification, cataloging, characterization and genetic targeting of mammalian brain cell types, an approach that is complementary to RNA expression analysis. The Center will conduct an integrated set of experiments that together will serve to identify, characterize and make genetically accessible, cell types across the entire nervous system. More than 1 million single neurons across the whole brain will be subjected to single cell epigenetic profiling. Cell types emerging from these profiles will be linked to anatomy for detailed characterization of their locations, morphology, and brain-wide connectivity and projections. And genetic profiling data will be used to generate tools to target gene expression to and interrogate the roles of cell types. By focusing on epigenetic profiling, the Center will harness knowledge of gene regulatory mechanisms to identify cell-type specific genetic enhancers. As has been the case in previous efforts to generate mouse lines on the basis of gene expression profiling, efforts will include both bottom up and top down approaches. Knowledge of differences in the connectivity/anatomy of cell types will be used to allow epigenetic profiles to be linked to anatomy. Knowledge of epigenetic differences between cell populations will be used to identify enhancers, which restrict gene expression to neuronal populations that will be subsequently subjected to detailed characterization. The CEMBA-Data Core will collect, manage, analyze, visualize and distribute brain cell-type and anatomical data. Finally, the Administrative Core will effectively coordinate activities within the center and between cooperating centers in the Brain Cell Census Network."
"9423889","Uterine fibroids, benign tumors of the human uterus, affect 77% of women by menopause in the U.S. and account for $5.9-34.4 billion in annual healthcare costs. Until recently, tumor tissue and cell culture studies investigating fibroid growth have been the primary sources for understanding fibroid pathophysiology. Genetic predisposition to fibroids has been documented in twin studies, where up to 69% of risk is heritable. We propose to identify common and rare variants associated with fibroid risk through GWAS, whole genome, and exome resequencing. We have convened a consortium of studies with GWAS data and imaging-confirmed fibroid cases and controls in the Electronic Medical Record and Genomics (eMERGE) Network. We have developed and validated a phenotyping algorithm in the BioVU DNA databank at Vanderbilt with stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria that requires pelvic imaging. Our phenotyping algorithm was implemented at seven eMERGE sites to generate harmonized phenotypes classified by common criteria across cases and controls with GWAS data in eMERGE. Among subjects with GWAS data, exome sequencing is available for 3,045 cases and 8,598 controls from Geisinger Health System MyCode Community Health Initiative (MyCode) and 500 cases and 500 controls from BioVU. We will conduct multi-stage transethnic GWAS and association studies in next-generation sequencing data for fibroid risk, leveraging existing genetic data, data generated by other funding (R01HD074711, R03HD078567), and new data from this application. Our Specific Aims are to: 1. Conduct a multi-stage transethnic EHR consortium meta-analysis of fibroid risk. We will conduct fixed effects meta-analysis of SNP summary statistics with 7,242 cases and 14,895 controls from eMERGE for Discovery. We will conduct in silico analysesof the strongest associated SNPs in over 7,000 cases and 14,000 controls for Replication. 2. Conduct a large-scale whole genome and exome resequencing study using BioVU and MyCode. We will use existing exome sequencing data for 3,645 cases and 9,098 controls from MyCode at 75X and BioVU at 50X to assess rare coding variants, and conduct whole genome sequencing at 15X in an additional 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls from BioVU for Discovery. We use 4,500 independent cases and 12,000 controls that will accrue in MyCode with exome sequencing, and additional existing 1,920 cases and 1,920 controls from BioVU with de novo genotyping of 50,000 SNPs for Replication of findings. 3. Evaluate the biological significance of associated variants in fibroid risk using bioinformatics approaches. We will use PrediXcan and PheWAS to further examine the SNPs/genes identified in Aims 1 and 2 for evidence of pleiotropy and mediation by regulation of gene expression. Little is known about the genetic causes of risk in fibroid disease. We propose an efficient and cost-effective approach to identify genetic risk factors for fibroids by taking advantage of available imaging, existing GWAS, sequencing, and DNA. This study will provide unparalleled genomic coverage for a large gold-standard collection of image-confirmed participants."
"9356314","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): PD: Pascual, V. / PI: Project 1 Pascual, V.  Project Summary  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by widespread inflammation  and development of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens. SLE is clinically heterogeneous and molecularly  diverse. This heterogeneity might contribute to the high occurrence of clinical trial failures, underscoring the  need for biomarkers to stratify patients according to individual pathogenic drivers of disease. In an attempt to  understand the complexity of SLE, we established a pediatric cohort and have followed it for the past decade  using validated clinical disease activity (DA) measures as well as blood gene expression profiles during flares  and remissions. Our studies confirm the prevalence of IFN, neutrophil/myeloid and plasmablast gene  signatures and their correlation with DA at the cohort level. Personalized immunomonitoring revealed,  however, significant heterogeneity in how these major signatures correlate with DA at the individual patient  level. We hypothesize that decoding the cellular and/or molecular components of these signatures in well-  defined groups of patients will enable development of biomarkers and computational tools for stratification,  which will enable rational clinical trial design.  Towards this goal, we are proposing two aims: 1) to establish the origin and composition of three major  SLE blood signatures at the single cell level. We will examine the cells that give rise to these signatures  using high definition immunophenotyping and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell levels; 2)  to determine if molecular DA markers correlate with altered cytosolic and/or endosomal nucleic acid  (NA) sensing pathways in ex vivo patient blood cells and in vitro assays. Here, we first propose to apply  a sensitive and robust assay to quantify the endogenous activity of cGAS, a universal cytosolic DNA sensor, in  PBMCs from patients during flares and remissions. Second, we will test the response of patient cells to  relevant endosomal and cytosolic nucleic acid ligands in vitro using multi-dimensional readouts. Through the  implementation of our aims, we will i) reveal the source of SLE molecular signatures; ii) understand the extent  of heterogeneity of blood SLE myeloid cells and plasma cells; iii) determine which cell subsets/molecular  pathways and/or NA sensors contribute to immune activation leading to SLE flares. Understanding SLE  heterogeneity and developing tools to assess it in the clinical setting will ultimately open new paths towards  personalized therapeutic approaches."

The Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) requests funding to address the shortfall of URMs and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals engaged in cancer research related careers. Our specific goal is to engage the scientific curiosity and promote the academic success and future research careers of promising young scientists from underrepresented communities. For over 15 years, DF/HCC has connected high school and college students from underrepresented populations to the world of cancer research by placing them in real research settings at Harvard University-affiliated cancer research institutions through a continuously funded P30 CURE Supplement ending this year. More than two thirds of our alumni have gone on to complete STEM degrees and to successfully pursue science and health-related careers. We propose to continue and expand this work through the YES for CURE Program, which will provide multi-year cancer and cancer disparities research experiences and educational programming for high school students and undergraduates in the Boston area. Each year, 40 talented high school and college students from the Boston area, selected through a competitive application process, will engage in a program comprised of three interrelated components: (1) mentored, full- time summer research experiences in DF/HCC cancer research labs; (2) a year-round innovative Strategies for Science Success curriculum focused on building scientific and professional competency; and (3) community and family engagement and outreach geared towards developing a supportive, informed, and engaged network who will nurture and empower program participants to achieve academic success and pursue careers in scientific research. These three components will be woven together into a comprehensive, multi-year experience that will prime participants for further academic training and careers in scientific research and the pursuit of further, program-independent research experiences. Further, we will leverage our extensive student tracking expertise to assess the impact of the YES for CURE Program on student interest in and preparation for cancer and cancer disparities research careers and their scientific skills and concepts acquisition. By focusing on students at the beginning of their academic career, we anticipate that the YES for CURE Program will spark and nurture participant interest in pursuing science degrees and cancer research careers and increase the retention of underrepresented participants in cancer-related fields."
"9331657","Box jellyfish envenomations account for myriad clinically significant sequelae, including debilitating sting-site pain and Irukandji syndrome, as well as in rare instances acute cardiovascular collapse and death, among residents and visitors to the U.S. coastal areas of Hawaii, Guam, Saipan, Florida, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Cubozoan stings are also an increasing public health threat worldwide in tropical and subtropical areas of Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Caribbean basin, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of Irukandji syndrome, a potentially life-threatening sequelae with multi-systems symptoms and signs, suggestive of ?cytokine storm? and ?catecholamine surge?. Our long-term goal is to develop rapid diagnostics and effective treatments for the full spectrum of cubozoan envenomations. For the proposed research, our primary objective is to clarify the role of venom porins in the pathogenesis of Irukandji syndrome, by employing previously established in vitro and in vivo model systems. Our central hypothesis is that the cubozoan pore-forming proteins, or porins, induce a domino-type cascade of time-dependent pathophysiological effects on platelets, erythrocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including an initial dose-dependent release of biogenic amines and stored cytokines, which in turn causes a secondary induction of cytokine release from nave leucocytes, as well as endothelial cells, that comprises Irukandji syndrome. A venom biochemist and an animal model expert will achieve the following specific aims. Aim 1. Compare the in vitro dose- and time-dependent effects of cubozoan whole venom and purified porin on human peripheral blood monocytes and platelets. Aim 2. Compare the in vivo dose-dependent effects of cubozoan whole venom and purified porin in piglets. Whole blood cell-based assays and a piglet animal model will be used to determine whether cubozoan porins cause specific systemic inflammatory effects and to track sequential physiological and biochemical responses in time-course experiments. Preliminary studies demonstrate that a central aspect of the pathogenesis of life- threatening jellyfish envenomation and Irukandji syndrome involves immune cell responses to cubozoan venom. Thus, this exploratory research project addresses a critical unmet need to better understand the pathophysiological role of cubozoan porin in order to develop rapid diagnostics and effective treatments."
"9439988","PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is increasing each year among young adult smokers but more than half of young adult smokers who start using e-cigarettes do not quit smoking, instead they become ?dual users.? While dual use could lead to reduced use of cigarettes, the long-term impact of using e-cigarettes on nicotine dependence, smoking behaviors, and health are unknown. Smoking behavior is generally viewed negatively by others. However, identifying as a ?vaper? (e-cigarette user) provides a more positive social image and allows young adult dual users to distance themselves from a smoker identity. Smoker identity is associated with smoking behavior in young adults. However, there is no research on vaper identity, how smoker and vaper identities influence each other, and how these identities influence smoking and vaping behaviors over time. The Aims of this study are 1) administer 2 online surveys to examine how smoking and vaping behaviors and identities change over 6 months in 18-29 year old young adult smokers who have initiated e-cigarette use in the past 6 months; 2) conduct on-line individual interviews with fifty of the participants who complete the second survey to explore the influence of social identity and social stigma on smoking and vaping behaviors; 3) validate measures of vaper identity and vaping stigma scales in young adult dual users. Young adults (n=500) who regularly smoke cigarettes, identify as a smoker, and initiated e-cigarette use in the past 6 months will be recruited to complete two online surveys 6 months apart. Participants will be recruited through online postings on social media sites popular with young adults including Buzzfeed, theSkimm, Craigslist, and Facebook. Young adults who see the posting and click on the link will answer a series of eligibility questions on a secure website. Eligible participants are then asked if they would be willing to take two online surveys and participate in an online interview if selected. Those who agree will take an online survey and another survey six months later. Eighty percent (n=400) of those who take the first survey are expected to take the second survey. Fifty of the young adults who complete the second survey will be invited to participate in an online interview for a more in-depth discussion of vaping and smoking identities and if/how these changed over 6 months. This study directly addresses FDA research questions #4 dual use, and #9 by examining identity which influences susceptibility to marketing messages. Smokers who have a stronger smoker identity are more susceptible to tobacco industry marketing messages. In this way, the e-cigarette industry can increase susceptibility to e- cigarette marketing messages by targeting young adult vaper identity. These findings will inform FDA regulations on e-cigarette industry marketing messages and practices. Findings can also assist the FDA in developing effective anti-smoking messages for dual users who may no longer identity as smokers to help extinguish smoking."
"9414126","Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain?s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER?s containers ? a standardized packaging for software ? this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery."
"9495035","Project Summary/Abstract The immune system surveys the skin and other barrier tissues such as lung and gut, but mechanisms for failed immunity in the periphery that lead to cancer or autoimmune diseases are unknown. The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to tolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different populations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have identified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining lymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance by unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely genetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of shared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully targeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed immune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are of great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during autoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these mechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in immunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete aims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular mechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining consequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth."
"9464140","PROJECT SUMMARY Advanced Chemotherapy Technologies (ACT) has developed a proprietary implantable iontophoretic device that facilitates the infusion of chemotherapy agents directly into a cancer tumor, minimizing toxic exposure to the vascular system and other organs. ACT is focusing specifically on treating pancreatic cancer with gemcitabine for this proposal. Pancreatic cancer has a five-year survival rate of less than 7% and relies on surgery as the only opportunity for a cure. 40% of patients are not eligible for surgery due to tumor expansion into nearby major blood vessels or nerves. ACT will implant the device, which delivers the drug using iontophoresis principles, directly into the tumor, and connect the device to the outside of the body through a catheter terminated in a skin port. ACT has designed a pre-clinical device used in extensive bench top and animal testing and will adapt the design for clinical testing. The animal models demonstrated very little systemic gemcitabine delivery when using iontophoresis to target drug delivery to the pancreas while showing marked tumor regression. In this application, ACT proposes to redesign the preclinical device and develop GMP manufacturing processes to produce clinical devices and conduct safety and efficacy testing to ensure the device is safe for human use. This application will include a limited small first-in-human trial that will assess the safety of iontophoretic infusion of gemcitabine into the pancreas. The proposed studies will serve as a critical step in device development and proof-of-concept demonstration of the targeted delivery of the chemotherapeutic agents by the device increasing the ability of the agent to reach the target while decreasing systemic impact."
"9391608","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Background/Rationale. About 15% of service members have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI)  on one or more occasions while deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation  New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). The long-term effects of TBI in civilians and in Vietnam veterans are known to include neurodegenerative conditions. However, little is currently known about TBI sustained during the ongoing conflicts and it is timely to investigate the chronic effects of blast and non-blast-related TBI in OEF/OIF/OND veterans and service members.  Project Objectives. The study's broad objective is to characterize the chronic effects of TBI sustained by OEF/OIF/OND veterans and service members, and the specific aims include the evaluation of these effects on cognition, neurologic status, and functional outcome in relation to secondary pathology shown by multimodality brain imaging. Related objectives include an examination of how genetics, cognitive reserve, and brain reserve moderate the chronic effects of TBI on outcome.  Project Methods. This dual cohort, longitudinal study would enroll 200 OEF/OIF/OND veterans and service members, including 150 who reported at least one TBI and 50 with an injury to body regions other than the brain or no injury. Participants would be enrolled at the Michael E. De Bakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MEDVAMC) and from a coordinated site at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) and Darnall Army Medical Center (DAMC) at Fort Hood. Following informed consent and screening for eligibility, participants who are least two months post-injury would complete a baseline, in-person assessment at the MEDVAMC or BAMC/DAMC that would include cognitive testing, functional status, neurologic examination, and brain imaging.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be performed to assess brain region and total white matter volumes and cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) would examine microstructural integrity of white matter tracts, resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) would measure spontaneous brain activation, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) would assess levels of neurotransmitters that are thought to be altered following TBI. A blood draw would provide serum for genotyping. Follow-ups would include web-based assessment of cognition and functional status at six and 18 months after baseline and a second in-person assessment at 12 months that would repeat the outcomes measurement and brain imaging that had been performed at baseline. Data would be archived in an object-oriented database designed for the storage and mining of scientific data in collaborative environments. Data management and statistical analysis would be performed by the senior project statistician at the MEDVAMC in coordination with the other study investigators.  Administrative oversight would be provided by subgroups of investigators and project staff organized by their expertise and roles, including Administration, Recruitment and Retention, Imaging, Neuropsychological Assessment, Neurological Examination, Genetics, and Data Management/Analysis. To ensure uniform procedures between the project sites, a workshop would be held and a project manual completed during the first three months. Quality assurance (QA) testing of the similar MRI scanners at the two project sites would ensure high quality image data and audits of the cognitive and behavioral data, including monitoring by neuropsychologists, would provide QA for those measures.  Relevance to the VA Health Mission. The chronic effects of single and repetitive TBI sustained by OEF/OIF/OND veterans and service members are poorly understood, but potentially include neurodegenerative conditions that impact the long-term health and quality of life of veterans and their families.  This project would enhance the capability of VHA to monitor and identify late effects of TBI, including the use of advanced brain imaging to inform planning of rehabilitation and healthcare resources."
"9561231","Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Epidemiology (CE)  The goal of the Cancer Epidemiology (CE) Program is to provide a platform to synergize research efforts of  epidemiologic and clinical researchers in order to elucidate pathways to cancer occurrence and progression  that can impact clinical treatment and prevention strategies. The program brings together experienced, NCI-  funded epidemiologists, molecular biologists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticists and NCCC clinicians around 3  central interactive program themes: (1) population genomics, (2) emerging risk factors, and (3) life course  epidemiology. Program investigators design, execute, and analyze population-based research aimed at  understanding cancer etiology, second malignancies, progression, and survival, as well as develop novel  methods for these lines of research. This work is based on outstanding efforts to use population-based studies  of the catchment area population and also to engage in research with national and international epidemiologic  resources, including clinical trials, cohort and case-control studies. Currently there are 22 members, including  3 clinical members and 1 joint member, spanning 11 departments with expertise and experience in all facets of  modern molecular epidemiology. The NCCC has been instrumental in supporting the efforts of the CE  program, most notably with its support of strategic, targeted recruitment efforts, including the recruitment of  Chris Amos, Olga Gorlova, Jennifer Doherty, Diane Gilbert-Diamond, Scott Williams, Amarendra Das, Zhigang  Li, Brock Christensen and Carmen Marsit, the latter who serves now as Co-Director of the program with  Margaret Karagas. Spurred by these recruitments and their synergies with existing member interests, the  present program has developed and evolved, from a broader program in Cancer Epidemiology and  Chemoprevention, to focus its efforts on cancer epidemiology research and translation. The program aims to  expand collaborative research efforts within its membership and across NCCC Programs, utilizing monthly  program meetings to encourage these activities, which are subsequently catalyzed by pilot grants funded by  NCCC. The support of the NCCC was paramount in the successful creation and funding of the new COBRE  Center for Molecular Epidemiology, the development of an interdisciplinary training program in the Quantitative  Population Sciences in Cancer, and a second COBRE in Integrative Biology. These initiatives have been  instrumental in the recruitment of talented faculty and trainees that continue to energize and grow cancer  epidemiology research. More than 580 cancer-related articles have been published over the reporting period  (85 [15%] in high impact journals), with all 22 members on intra-program (158=27%) and 19 members on inter-  program (74=13%) collaborations. Total funding for the program is currently $11.5M, of which $10.8M is peer-  reviewed and $2.9M is from NCI. These efforts will allow the CE program to continue to perform cutting-edge  molecular epidemiologic research, on the etiology and outcomes of cancer, to reduce the burden of human  malignancies and impact prevention and treatment strategies."
"9565785","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  The NIH has been a global leader in supporting research toward the improvement of both behavioral and biomedical, as well as combined, HIV prevention and treatment interventions. Although there have been significant advances in both general HIV basic and intervention trials research, and in research on the acute effects of alcohol on HIV-related sexual risk, a gap remains on the intersection of these two bodies of knowledge. NIAAA has long supported basic behavioral and social research as a foundation for HIV prevention interventions as part of its HIV/AIDS research portfolio. Recent examples of NIAAA's support of such research include its subscription to NIH FOAs PA-13-121, Research on alcohol and HIV/AIDS, and PA-14-061, Substance use and abuse, risky decision-making, and HIV-AIDS. Of direct relevance to the proposed application, since 2005 NIAAA has sponsored three (2005, 2007, and 2014, respectively) workshops held in the Washington, DC area dedicated to bringing together invited basic and prevention science alcohol/HIV/AIDS researchers to discuss their research and to foster communication and collaborations between the basic research and prevention science communities. The main objective of this application is to use the foundation laid through NIAAA's prior efforts by convening alcohol/HIV researchers in order to discuss and disseminate recent research findings toward the explicit end of integrating that knowledge into models of HIV prevention and thereby HIV behavioral primary and secondary interventions ultimately to enhance their effectiveness. The proposed series of four conference meetings/workshops, given their timing and context, will allow presentation of information to a wide array of alcohol/HIV researchers in a focused, timely manner that will accelerate the advance of behavioral HIV prevention interventions in a way that is not feasible given current limitations in the resources available to NIAAA programs to sponsor conferences and workshops."
"9552339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The mission of the Southwest Environmental Health Sciences Center (SWEHSC) is to understand the mechanisms behind the modulation of human disease risk by environmental exposures. This is essential to the long-term goal of bringing an improvement to the lives of the people of the Southwest by developing rational approaches to mitigating their risks of hazardous environmental exposures and by maximizing their protective environmental exposures. The geographic location of the SWEHSC, with its rich Hispanic and Native American cultural heritage, provides unique opportunities for basic environmental health sciences research to impact the health of these minority populations.  Moreover, the strengthening of ties between    SWEHSC faculty and academic and governmental agencies in northern Mexico will facilitate the enhancement of bi-national initiatives in the environmental health sciences, with the real ability to improve public health along the U.S./Mexico border.  Focusing the investigators' efforts on arid environment, diseases, and people common to the Southwest will allow broad translation to global stakeholders with similar populations and environments.  Research at SWEHSC is coordinated within themes.  Leaders of each thematic area have been charged with developing interdisciplinary groups aimed at integrating investigators with diverse expertise to produce environmental health deliverables through the incorporation of key elements of the investigators' philosophy for environmental health science, including i) a human/translational focus, ii) defining protective as well as harmful environmental exposures, iii) viewing environmental problems through an international perspective, and iv) utilizing cutting edge technology to enable systems-level biological analysis. The SWEHSC embraces 4 major scientific themes: Southwest Hazardous Environmental Exposure (RFG1), Environmental Lung Diseases (RFG2), ROS and Disease Prevention (RFG3), and Exposure, Fate, and Disposition (RFG4).  The research efforts of SWEHSC are complemented by four Facility Cores (FC) offering state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise to assist investigators in developing and utilizing cutting-edge technologies: Cellular Imaging, Genomics, Proteomics, and Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core. The Administrative Core provides enrichment programs, including seminars, workshops, an annual Science Fair, newsletters, and supports the activities of the Internal and External Advisory Boards.  The SWEHSC also promotes innovative research through the Pilot Project Program, and in the recruitment of new investigators. The Career Development Core provides mentoring to junior investigators and cross-training of researchers in current techniques to enhance the environmental health science research programs of fellows and clinicians, and for bench researchers establishing human studies research. The Community Outreach and Education Core (COEC) supports the SWEHSC mission of community involvement by translating and disseminating the research findings of SWEHSC scientists.  During the next five years SWEHSC will continue to extend basic environmental health sciences research into the public health and clinical arenas. Such translational initiatives are integral to the goals of SWEHSC."
"9386342","SUMMARY The Administrative Core is the essential infrastructure that will enable synergy and coordination of the projects, scientific cores and the collaborating sites of SickleGenAfrica. The goals of the administrative Core are necessarily broad and include administration and management aimed at providing oversight of the research program of the Center and to coordinate all internal and external meetings of investigators and staff. The core will ensure that projects remain scientifically competitive, and aligned with the scientific premise of the Center by recruiting experts outside of the H3African Center to continually evaluate center research. It will oversee travel centrally by coordinating the travel of investigators, staff, and advisory board members to internal center meetings, H3Africa consortium meetings, and other scientific meetings. The core will be responsible for all non-science-related ordering where practically feasible and provide a budget overview of each project and core at monthly meetings. A major goal of the core is to provide career enhancement opportunities throughout the academic pipeline and promote faculty career development. To this end the core will offer opportunities to students (undergraduate, graduate and postdocs) and early-stage investigators across sub-Saharan Africa with an interest in hemoglobin disorders to acquire cutting-edge training and skills to move-up the academic ladder through a series of short-term and long-term research education programs. It will leverage several existing training programs directed by its Leadership to develop career enriching programs. The administrative core will ensure career development and milestone achievement of junior investigators in the Center. The core will ensure compliance with regulatory requirements before research is able to proceed and will prepare all NIH progress reports and other required information in a timely manner while conforming to NIH and H3Africa policies/guidelines regarding intellectual property and conflict of interest. Center personnel will be committed to following the ethical principles that all human subjects should be afforded; autonomy, beneficence, equity, and privacy, and insuring the appropriate care, use, and humane treatment of animals used for research. The admin core will be responsible for information dissemination via multiple media with peer-reviewed publications being the predominant means. The Core will provide support for planning, graphics support, bibliography generation, proofreading, and submission of manuscripts. In addition, study results will be disseminated through a new website. Additional outlets to reach internal and external entities will be utilized, including related programs at all collaborating institutions, the H3African Consortium, and the press. A primary goal of the administrative core will be for information and data to be quickly and accurately disclosed, and to build community trust in the work of the Center."
"9453181","ABSTRACT  We propose to develop and evaluate simple, variable-specific indices of non-ignorable selection bias for researchers in the health sciences working with data collected from non-probability samples. Classical methods of scientific probability sampling and corresponding ?design-based? frameworks for making statistical inferences about populations have long been used in the health sciences to advance scientific knowledge. The random selection of elements from a population of interest into a probability sample, where all population elements have a known non-zero probability of selection, ensures that elements included in the sample mirror the population in expectation. That is, for all variables of interest, the mechanism of selection of a subset of elements into the sample is ignorable, following the theoretical framework for missing data mechanisms originally introduced by Donald Rubin. Unfortunately, the modern survey research environment has had a severe negative impact on these ?tried and true? methods of survey research that rely on probability samples: it has become harder and harder to contact sampled units, survey response rates continue to decline in all modes of administration (face-to-face, telephone, etc.), and the costs of collecting and maintaining scientific probability samples are steadily rising. Health science researchers are thus turning to volunteers and relatively inexpensive sources of ?big data? collected from samples where the probabilities of selection are unknown (e.g., commercial databases, or social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook).  A key question that arises from analyses of these non-probability samples is how good the resulting population inferences are. If the mechanisms underlying selection into the non-probability sample depend on the variables of research interest, then estimates of population parameters may well be biased. The proposed research aims to draw on recent developments in the survey statistics literature related to assessment of the bias arising from non-ignorable nonresponse in surveys, and develop simple but novel model-based indices of non-ignorable selection bias for non-probability samples, in addition to methods for adjusting population inferences based on those indices. The proposed indices offer advantages over competing indices in terms of their focus on specific survey variables. They are also entirely model-based, enabling researchers to develop appropriate models relating their key survey measures to auxiliary variables that are known for the responding persons and available in aggregate for the target population. This research will have widespread impact, enabling quantification of (and adjustment for) the bias in estimates arising from non-probability samples."
"9312120","Project Summary/Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease and affects about 1% of the population aged 65 and older. It is often thought of as a condition that selectively targets the dopamine (DA) neuronal system for destruction, giving rise to the well-known motor deficits of tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. The first-line pharmacological treatment for PD is L-DOPA, which is intended to replenish brain DA levels and thereby provide significant relief from these movement problems. It is not widely appreciated but the serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) neuronal systems are also severely degraded in PD. While it is appropriate that so much attention is focused on the motor symptomatology of PD, increased interest in non-motor manifestations of PD is called for in light of the fact that approximately 80% of PD patients suffer from co-morbid neuropsychiatric conditions such as sleep disorders, anxiety and dementia. The most prevalent affective disorder is depression. The non-motor symptoms (NMS) of PD, whether related to the disease process or induced by L-DOPA, are not trivial and contribute to worsened disability, impaired quality of life and shortened life expectancy. In fact, it has been determined that NMS of PD have a greater impact on health-related quality of life than motor symptoms. It is also clear that affective disorders in PD are not simply a consequence of psychological distress due to the development of a chronic debilitating disease. Many of the NMS of PD can be rationally linked to reductions in function of the 5HT and NE neuronal systems and this is reinforced by the strategy usually followed when treating the NMS of PD- use of drugs that increase the synaptic levels of these monoamines or that activate their receptors. These treatments (i.e. blockers of the 5HT and NE transporters, receptor agonists) have not been that effective and in some cases, they even oppose the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA. The rationale for studies in this application starts with the recognition that 5HT and NE deficits, in the face of extensive losses of DA neurons, likely contribute to the NMS of PD. The appearance of NMS cannot be accounted for by the singular loss of DA neurons in PD. The proposed work in this application will take advantage of the availability in our laboratory of an innovative mouse model that lacks the gene for tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2). This new model was created using a Cre-ERT2-Lox recombination approach to induce the loss of TPH2 and 5HT after tamoxifen treatment of adult mice. Mice with 5HT deficits will be treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a neurotoxin that targets dopamine neurons for destruction, and/or with N-(2- chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), a highly selective toxin that targets NE neurons. The emergence of NMS will be assessed using a battery of behavioral, neurological, neurochemical and cognitive tests. Thereafter, mice lacking the monoamines will be treated with L-DOPA, L-DOPS (Droxidopa) and/or 5- HTP to replenish brain levels of DA, NE and 5HT, respectively. It is hypothesized that the NMS of PD emerge when DA neurons are lost on a background of 5HT and NE depletion. It is further hypothesized that 5-HTP and L-DOPS will effectively relieve the NMS of PD without diminishing the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA in treating the motor deficits. 5-HTP and L-DOPS are amino acid precursors to 5HT and NE, respectively, and have been used to treat humans in numerous clinical trials. Therefore, their use to reduce the NMS of PD represents a safe, simple and translational approach."
"9569861","PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a greater burden of HIV/AIDS than any other population group in the US, comprising only 2% of the population but 56% of individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Although much of the increased incidence in HIV has been reported among young MSM (YMSM), especially among racial and ethnic minority groups, and is linked to high-risk sexual behavior, there remains a dearth of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions for YMSM ? and none that address racially/ethnically diverse YMSM. To address this need, our study, in response to RFA-MD-15-012, leverages mobile technology and MyPEEPS, an existing theory-driven, multi-ethnic, group-level, evidence-based intervention for diverse YMSM. MyPEEPS is a manualized curriculum, developed by members of our proposed Investigative team, comprised of 6 modules focusing on key intermediate social and personal factors, including knowledge (e.g., correct way to use a condom), self-efficacy for safer sex, interpersonal communication skills and behavioral skills. MyPEEPS is one of the only HIV prevention interventions in the literature that focuses on diverse adolescent MSM. Long-term sustainability of face-to face, group-level behavioral interventions, such as MyPEEPS, have been problematic for dissemination in at-risk populations, particularly among young racial and ethnic minority groups. In response to this challenge, we propose to translate MyPEEPS from a face-to-face, group-based curriculum to a mobile, responsive-driven web-based platform, accessible by smartphone or other web-enabled devices, to increase accessibility and scalability for diverse YMSM. The ubiquitous nature of mobile phones in daily life, especially among 13-18 year olds, has created opportunities for health interventions in a portable format with enhanced privacy. Using a participatory approach, our study will incorporate user-centered design in the translation of the MyPEEPS intervention onto a mobile platform. MyPEEPS Mobile will be tested in an RCT with racially and ethnically diverse HIV-negative or unknown status YMSM aged 13-18 at four geographically diverse sites: Birmingham, Chicago, New York City, and Seattle, allowing for increased generalizability of findings. The proposed MyPEEPS Mobile intervention is a novel and evidence-driven intervention using mobile technology to deliver HIV prevention information specifically developed for at-risk YMSM. This will be the one of the first studies to test the efficacy of a scaled-up, mobile version of an existing HIV prevention intervention originally developed for, designed by, and piloted for, a diverse group of YMSM. The research team has unique experience and expertise to conduct this important work and has conducted significant preliminary work related to the project goals. If efficacious, the public health impact is large, as the intervention will already be in mobile format which is well-suited for widespread dissemination."

"9377855","Abstract Immune-based therapies are generating considerable excitement due to the success of drugs targeting immune checkpoints. Only small subsets of patients are benefitting from this therapeutic approach, implying that important molecular modifiers of the tumor microenvironment need to be better understood. Endometrioid- type endometrial carcinoma (EEC) accounts for approximately 75% of all endometrial carcinomas, the fourth most common cancer in women in the US. From TCGA data (and validated from our own patient data) we have identified four transcriptome subtypes of EEC with distinct clinicopathologic characteristics and mutation spectra. Cluster II consists of younger, obese patients with low grade EEC yet diminished survival. Although the Cluster II tumors had the lowest overall mutation rate, CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations were very common. These mutations were associated with activation of the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, exon 3 mutations of CTNNB1 are likely a driver for a subset of more aggressive EEC. We hypothesized for the parent SPORE proposal that CTNNB1 mutations reprogram the molecular and cellular landscapes leading to clinically aggressive EEC. In aim 2 of the parent proposal, we will test the hypothesis that CTNNB1 mutation and Wnt/?-catenin pathway activation result in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that would contribute to worse survival. For the expansion proposal, we will focus on 2 other molecular pathways, PTEN and CD73-generated adenosine, that are also important for endometrial carcinoma and may contribute to localized immune suppression. PTEN loss leading to activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in EEC is common, occurring in more than 50% of cases. Recent evidence in melanoma suggests that PTEN loss leads to increased expression of immunosuppressive cytokines, decreased T lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor, and decreased T lymphocyte-mediated tumor cell death. CD73 is the rate-limiting enzyme in adenosine biosynthesis. We have recently shown that CD73 helps to maintain cell-cell contacts via filopodia and membrane zippers that require cortical F-actin polymerization. Loss of CD73 was associated with higher endometrial cancer grade, advanced endometrial cancer stage, and worse survival. Loss of the cell-cell contacts leads to defects in the normal epithelial cell barrier function, which may lead to alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment. The expansion project hypothesis is that PTEN loss and decreased CD73 contribute to endometrial cancer progression by promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Expansion Specific Aim 1. Determine if PTEN protein loss is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in EEC. Expansion Specific Aim 2. Determine if loss of CD73 is associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment in EEC. For both aims, we will focus on microsatellite-stable EEC and characterize immune cell infiltrates, PD-L1 expression, and tissue cytokines levels."
"9465866","ABSTRACT  Thetis plans to investigate TP-317, an innovative and potential first in-class therapeutic agent, as an oral therapy for the induction and maintenance of remission of intestinal inflammation symptoms in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. While the precise etiology of UC is unknown, it is thought to result from an inappropriate inflammatory response to commensal gut bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals. Current treatment regimens for treatment of UC can be: 1) excessively broad in scope, inducing a pan-suppression of host immunity and a predisposition to infection and malignancy, and 2) not uniformly effective or durable, as evidenced by the high percentage of complications of the disease. Novel oral agents that are safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of UC remission would represent a major improvement in treatment options.  TP-317 is a unique derivative of Resolvin E1 (RvE1), a metabolite of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). RvE1 is part of the resolvin family of specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), a group of enzymatically hydroxylated metabolites derived from EPA. SPMs, including RvE1, are particularly important for maintaining immunological homeostasis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is constantly exposed to bacterial antigens and other inflammatory stimuli. By delivering RvE1 to the intestinal mucosa, TP- 317 has prospects to promote the resolution of inflammation, accelerate intestinal tissue repair and minimize exposure to potentially harmful inflammation without sacrificing host-protective functions of the innate immune system. RvE1 has been shown in several well-designed studies to be effective in treating UC in animal models. Through innovative medicinal chemistry, Thetis has developed proprietary technology to convert bioactive lipids into solid, stable, small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Using this technology, Thetis chemically transforms RvE1 into TP-317, an innovative NME with pharmaceutical and IP credentials that represents a novel approach to immunoresolution-based therapeutics for UC. TP-317 offers several key advantages including (1) rapid dissociation in aqueous solution to deliver RvE1 as the natural material that is an endogenous mediator regulating inflammatory processes; (2) an anticipated favorable safety profile with prospects for minimal off-target effects; and (3) favorable physico-chemical properties that make TP-317 amenable to formulation as a tablet or capsule for oral administration.  Phase 1 of this SBIR Fast Track will demonstrate the efficacy of oral TP-317 for the treatment of UC (Specific Aim #1) and characterize the pharmacokinetics of oral TP-317 (Specific Aim #2). Phase 2 of this project will include initial characterization of TP-317 safety and toleration (Specific Aim #3), synthesis and qualification of TP-317 for use in GLP studies (Specific Aim # 4), and conduct of full GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies (Specific Aim #5). On completion of this Fast-track SBIR project, Thetis will be in a position to complete CMC activities and subsequently prepare and submit an IND filing to initiate Phase I clinical studies."
"9539140","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy (3DEM) is emerging as a powerful method for determining the three-dimensional structures of large biological assemblies in solution and in the cell, enabling elucidation of complex biological interactions that are integral to understanding the inner workings of cellular machinery, and yielding novel insights into fundamental biological processes. Hundreds of 3DEM experiments are now reported in the literature each year and more than 1,300 structures are available in public archives through EMDataBank (EMDataBank.org). The major goal of this project is to establish methods to assess the reliability of these structures and to create uniform standards for data exchange, in order to bridge the current substantial gap between 3DEM and established structure determination methods (X-ray crystallography and NMR) in the ability to evaluate and interpret the experimental results. EMDataBank will take a leadership role in facilitating the processes necessary to assess, establish, and disseminate validation methods and data standards. The approach will leverage the expertise and experience of the EMDataBank team in validation, standards, and 3DEM methods development. Validation methods for both 3DEM maps and map-derived models will be established using our own test data sets and software packages as well as those contributed by other electron microscopists. Our results will be made publicly available for comment and review on the EMDataBank website. The PDB exchange dictionary will be extended to support 3DEM community-reviewed validation procedures. Map and map-derived model validation procedures developed through this project will be integrated into the deposition and annotation pipeline of the Protein Data Bank. The work is expected to have a strong transformative impact on both the 3DEM and the wider bioscience communities, enabling independent assessment and interpretation of 3DEM experimental results by both expert and non-expert scientists, and leading to higher reliability and improved consistency of 3DEM structure data."

To address these disparities, our team of academic and community partners through support from NIMHD and the Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center has collaborated for 10 years to develop, implement, test, refine, and expand a community based-based, family- focused diabetes prevention intervention for obese Latino adolescents. Every Little Step Counts (ELSC) is a comprehensive lifestyle intervention that is framed within an Ecodevelopmental Model to leverage individual, social, community, and cultural factors in order to improve health behaviors (nutrition and physical activity) and reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes among obese Latino adolescents. Preliminary results from our current P20-funded trial support the efficacy of the ELSC intervention to improve glucose tolerance among 90 obese Latino adolescents (age 14-16). We now propose a long-term follow-up of participants who completed ELSC over the past four years and are now young adults (age 18-22) in order to 1) describe individual diabetes- related health profiles following the lifestyle intervention and 2) examine how cultural family norms, the home food environment, and neighborhood environment are associated with changes in health profiles over time. We will use latent profile analyses to examine the following aims. Specific Aim 1: To describe individual diabetes risk profiles over a 5-year period in response to a culturally-grounded diabetes prevention intervention for obese Latino adolescents. Specific Aim 2: To examine whether cultural family norms that include family cohesion, familism, and supportive parenting styles are associated with individual diabetes risk profiles over time. Specific Aim 3: To examine whether the home food environment (availability of fruits, vegetables, high- sugar foods and beverages) is associated with individual diabetes risk profiles over time. Specific Aim 4: To examine if the neighborhood built environment (walkability) or social environment (disadvantage, cohesion, and trust) are associated with individual diabetes risk profiles over time. The project builds upon an established academic-community collaboration and a comprehensively characterized cohort from a vulnerable and underrepresented population. The team has an extensive track-record for translating research findings into meaningful health promotion and disease prevention interventions in the community. This project targets an understudied population that has undergone a critical developmental transition that is associated with future health outcomes. Lastly, the contextual factors of interest have not been studied in the context of long-term health changes following lifestyle intervention. The findings from this project will directly inform further refinement of a successful intervention in order to make a greater impact in a population at very high risk for diabetes-related morbidity."
