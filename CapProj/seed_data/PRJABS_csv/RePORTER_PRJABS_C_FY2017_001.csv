"9164537","ABSTRACT  The long-term goal of this research project is to understand the role of scaffolding proteins in the regulation of opioid receptors. Opioids are commonly administered as systemic analgesics to treat acute, chronic, and intractable pain syndromes. However, activation of mu opioid receptors (MOPr) throughout the central nervous system produces negative side effects that often contraindicate continued use. Targeting peripheral MOPr reduces pain and circumvents systemic side effects (Stein et al., 2003), yet peripheral opioid receptors behave differently than those expressed in the central nervous system, and their regulation is poorly understood. This represents a large gap in knowledge and an important unmet need, since the careful identification of contributors to opioid receptor responsiveness in the periphery would provide new, peripheral therapeutic targets for analgesic drug development. The overall objective of this application is to determine whether the scaffolding protein A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 79/150 (AKAP) regulates MOPr responsiveness. The central hypothesis for this study is that AKAP supports MOPr signaling. This hypothesis will be addressed through two specific aims that (1) determine the contribution of AKAP to MOPr signaling in sensory neurons and (2) evaluate AKAP association with MOPr. AKAP regulation of signaling pathways downstream of MOPr will be investigated through a combination of pharmacological, biochemical, and molecular techniques. Furthermore, primary sensory neuron cultures will be utilized to increase translational relevance with future behavioral studies. The contribution of this research is significant because it is the first step towards identifying specific regulatory components of the peripheral opioid receptor signaling system. Together with preliminary data, research results will demonstrate that AKAP association with MOPr positively regulates signaling downstream of the receptor, thereby increasing opioid analgesia.  "
"9168399","Abstract Human organs such as the brain are stunningly complex. They consist of hundreds to thousands of separate functional areas, each containing a comparable number of distinct cell types and innumerable molecules. Understanding how these multi-scale components work together to generate systems-level responses is essential for many fields of biology, but advancement in this area is hampered by the prevalent methodology of dividing biological systems into known cell types and then separately studying each population. Although powerful, this reductionistic approach makes it difficult to interrogate complex interactions at multiple levels ? molecular (e.g., proteins), subcellular (e.g., synapses), cellular, and area level. Moreover, this approach could ignore many potentially important but unidentified functional networks. Our inability to thoroughly identify multi- scale functional networks and interrogate their system-wide, multifactorial interactions has limited our ability to understand the function and dysfunction of complex biological systems. Here, we aim to fundamentally transform our approach from a reductionistic to a holistic one by developing cutting-edge platforms for proteomic reconstruction of organ-wide multi-scale networks. Using murine and human clinical samples and organoids as our models, we will develop four broadly applicable cross-disciplinary platforms that integrate chemical and material engineering technologies. These platforms will enable: (1) scalable tissue transformation into an indestructible, proteome-containing three-dimensional (3D) framework; (2) unlimited rounds of molecular phenotyping of a single intact tissue with precise volume co-registration of multiple datasets; (3) rapid, scalable, and uniform tissue labeling by synchronizing target-probe binding reactions organ-wide; (4) superresolution proteomic imaging of intact organs. If successful, our proposed work will enable proteome- driven holistic reconstruction and high-dimensional quantitative phenotyping of intact biological systems at unprecedented resolution. Using the technology platforms and human brain organoid models, both healthy and diseased, we will investigate the following fundamental questions: (Q1) How many cell types/regions exist at different developmental stages of the brain organoids? (Q2) How these cells and regions form networks? (Q3) How proteomic states of subcellular components, individual cells, circuits, and regions change throughout the development. (Q4) How morphological features of cells change? (Q5) how Q1-4 are altered in diseased organoids? This study may provide new insights into understanding human organ development in health and disease."
"9257211","PROJECT ABSTRACT Reports estimate nearly 2 million unaccompanied homeless youth aged 13-24 in the United States each year.1 Nearly 40% of these youth were formerly a part of the foster care system.2 Research has demonstrated that homeless youth are at elevated risk for HIV3-10 and a separate body of research has reported elevated risk for HIV among foster and former foster youth.11-14 Thus, the accumulation of risk factors common to both homeless youth and former foster youth place this large population of homeless former foster youth in the nexus of life experiences that position them at extreme risk for engaging in a number of HIV risk behaviors, and necessitating an increase in intervention research to address the unique needs of this population. While interventions targeting HIV prevention efforts have focused on homeless youth, little research has focused on the impact of unique foster care experiences on HIV risk behaviors. And because studies have begun to discover the role of foster care in network disruption and network engagement10 and we know that HIV risk behaviors are impacted by network engagement,30 a need exists to better understand the network characteristics of homeless young adults with a history of foster care and associations between these characteristics, and HIV-risk behaviors. While current studies have examined some HIV risk behaviors by foster care status,10 limitations in the current data do not reflect the heterogeneity of foster care experiences. Based on our knowledge of the impact of networks on HIV risk behaviors, and the lack of research on the impact of foster care experiences on network engagement, the current state of the literature lacks a focus on the unique experiences of homeless former foster youth, and the ways these experiences impact network engagement and HIV risk behaviors, in order to better inform and adapt HIV interventions for homeless youth. The study?s goals include drastically increasing knowledge regarding HIV risk among homeless former foster youth. This study proposes primary data collection of a sample of homeless youth with a history of foster care, utilizing the data collection site and methods used in the quantitative survey data and social network data from an NIMH-funded R01 study (MH903336; PI: Rice). The use of primary data will provide a unique contribution to the literature and increase our understanding of the impact of foster care experience and network engagement on HIV risk among homeless youths. These findings will be used to inform new directions in homeless youth interventions; specifically what network-level interventions could be adapted to prevent HIV risks in the homeless former foster youth population. Training goals include in-depth coursework and mentoring to apply the findings of these results to intervention adaption and development focused on network-based HIV interventions for homeless former foster youth."
"9343202","PROJECT SUMMARY  The DIAN-TU was formed to design and manage interventional therapeutic trials and find a treatment that provides cognitive benefit for those certain to develop autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). The DIAN-TU trial platform is now fully operational in 6 countries, 24 sites, 3 languages and nearing completion of enrollment in October 2015 for the first two drugs. Initial funding for the DIAN-TU trial platform established the infrastructure and operations for executing clinical trials in ADAD and acknowledged the need for evolution within this platform.  The DIAN-TU Next Generation Prevention Trial will add two new drug arms to the DIAN-TU trial platform and propose key design changes that allow the platform to test next generation drugs with diverse mechanisms of action more quickly. Significant innovations include: (1) cognitive run-in period prior to drug administration to provide greater power to detect drug effects, (2) self-administered cognitive testing, (3) pre- defined dose escalation algorithm to safely maximize target engagement, (4) four year cognitive endpoint adaptive trial design that includes both early biomarker and later cognitive interims to inform early efficacy or futility, (5) novel imaging (e.g. Tau PET and diffusion basis spectrum imaging MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid measures (6) ADAD Disease Progression Model to detect changes in cognition earlier and with fewer participants compared to Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure. Taken together, this innovative approach for testing disease modifying therapies has the potential to definitively test the amyloid hypothesis and accelerate identification of effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of AD.  Many disease modifying therapies currently in development target A?, which is believed to be the initiator and earliest change in the AD process. These A? therapies may be most beneficial in the ADAD population and earlier in the disease to delay the onset of dementia. A fundamental and unresolved question is which target will provide the best cognitive response.  The trial design is a multi-center, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, four year cognitive endpoint registration study of two potential disease modifying therapies in 230 individuals at risk for and with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. The study will test the ability of a BACEi and an anti-oligomeric A? antibody to slow or prevent cognitive decline in asymptomatic (CDR 0, >70%) or mildly symptomatic (CDR 0.5 or 1, <30%) ADAD mutation carriers in the range of -15 to +10 years with respect to estimated age of cognitive symptom onset. 115 subjects per drug program will receive either drug or placebo with 3:1 randomization for four years to determine clinical benefit of the primary outcome of DIAN-TU cognitive composite and secondary outcomes of cognitive and clinical measures, safety, and AD biomarkers."
"9127517","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Untreated PTSD elevates risk of concurrent alcohol and drug dependence (>50% and >30% respectively), which in turn elevates risk of HIV sexual-risk behavior (HSB). A meta-analysis of HIV prevention, found few interventions address risk factors such as trauma exposure, mental health, or SUD and interventions which failed to do so had poorer condom use outcomes and were less effective for those with PTSD. From a public health perspective addressing PTSD and substance use disorders (SUD) is an important but overlooked means of preventing HIV/STI. American Indian (AI) communities are at disproportionate risk for untreated PTSD, SUD and HIV/STI risk. Self-medication of PTSD through substance use leads to development of SUDs, and exacerbates HSB. Therefore, treatment of PTSD that also decreases substance use in individuals may prevent the initiation or relapse of HIV risk behaviors. Similarly, directly intervening to reduce substance use via increasing motivation to decrease use and enhance coping strategies should prevent SUD development, and improve HSB and PTSD. Thus addressing PTSD or substance use may effectively prevent HSB. Built on an 8-year community-based participatory partnership, in full collaboration with the Tribal Nation, this study proposes a 5-year two-arm randomized comparative effectiveness trial to evaluate prevention of HIV/STI sexual risk behavior by directly addressing PTSD or substance use. We will evaluate Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) versus Motivational Interviewing with Skills Training (MIST) in HIV/STI prevention. AI elder and community leaders have insisted that we can keep providing substance use or sexual risk programs but until we get to the underlying cause - trauma - then we'll keep replacing one means of avoidance for another. This study will help address this community-generated clinical and empirical question. The overall goal is to compare two evidence based treatments, each addressing a different HSB causal pathway. NET addresses PTSD preventing SUD and HSB. MIST addresses substance misuse preventing SUD and HSB. Aim 1: To examine a PTSD versus a substance use-focused intervention to prevent HSB. We will conduct a two-arm randomized comparative effectiveness trial comparing NET (n=100) to MIST (n=100) among AI men and women with PTSD symptoms. We will evaluate the effect of reductions in PTSD severity and substance use (e.g., frequency, quantity, intentions, relapse, and initiation of use) on HSB (e.g., number of partners, sex while using substances, unprotected sex, and sex with high-risk partners) at post, 6, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 2: To examine theoretical mediators of treatment on HSB outcomes including emotional regulation, cognitive reappraisals, coping self-efficacy, communication skills, assertiveness, and community connectiveness."
"9137681","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular functional decline is worsened in patients and animals models with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) due to increased structural remodeling of cardiovascular tissues. Previous studies evaluating molecular mechanisms underlying these cardiovascular changes have revealed a central role for Na/K-ATPase (NKA) receptor complex activation in cardiac fibrosis. Signaling by the NKA receptor complex is induced by increased plasma levels of the cardiotonic steroid (CTS), Marinobufagenin (MBG). In accordance, inhibition of NKA signaling by Src or mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitors led to attenuation of cardiac fibrosis. However, these inhibitors also caused increased cardiac cell death when used in conjunction with elevated levels of CTS. Strategies to prevent fibrosis were then shifted to seek a more specific target that directly regulates fibrotic growth in the heart. Using heart tissue from 5/6th partial nephrectomized (PNx) or MBG-infused animals, data shows that PNx and MBG infusion significantly decreased microRNA 29b (miR29b) expression, which directly targets mRNA of collagen, an essential component for fibrosis. The role of miR29b in collagen synthesis and fibrosis in vitro has been well established. In animal models, significant down- regulation of miR-29b correlates with significantly increased collagen mRNA levels in cardiac tissues. Given the in vivo data and evidence from literature, it is hypothesized that miR29b is an important regulator of cardiac fibrosis with specific inhibitory effects on profibrotic signaling in cardiac cells and that miR29b mimics can be used as a potential in vivo therapeutic agents to prevent cardiac fibrosis induced by CKD.  Specifically, in vitro it is aimed to test if over-expression of miR29b prevents collagen synthesis induced by MBG in cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. In vivo, the aim is to test if chronic miR29b mimic infusion prevents cardiac fibrosis in the PNx model of CKD. Research has shown that PNx and MBG-infusion cause cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyopathy. Both increase plasma MBG-Levels, NKA-receptor complex signaling activation and decrease miR-29b expression in cardiac tissues. To determine whether exogenously increasing miR29b levels prevents cardiac fibrosis in the PNx model of CKD, rats subjected to PNx-surgery will be infused with either miR29b mimic or scramble miRNA through an osmotic minipump. Four weeks following PNx, rats will be sacrificed and the left ventricle evaluated for miR29b levels and physiological measures of cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular function. This study if successful will provide a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing CKD induced cardiovascular decline associated cardiac fibrosis, while also providing proof of concept approaches to utilizing miRNA mimics to treat diseases."
"9132918","Project Summary/Abstract Several studies have explored associations of air pollution with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), with all but one suggesting that some aspect of air pollution increases the risk of ASD, but details of this association remain uncertain. While these studies have found associations with, in particular, traffic-related pollutants and particulate matter (PM), they have in general been relatively small and most have been limited to California. One study in Taiwan, one in Sweden (among twins), and one combining several European cohorts are the only non-U.S. studies, and they came to different conclusions. More exploration of these exposures are needed outside the U.S. context. Furthermore, understanding critical windows of exposure, and susceptible populations is critical. A study of ours and one other have suggested effects specific to the 3rd trimester. Prior work of ours has also suggested that associations with air pollutants may be specific to boys, but the numbers of ASD cases among girls were too small to adequately address this. Our goal is to examine the basic question of the association between maternal exposure to air pollutants and ASD, and details of any association, in a very large cohort in a very different setting: the population of Israel. Israel represents a unique setting for the study of air pollutants and ASD for several reasons: 1) Air pollution levels are higher and with a wider range than in the US; 2) Dust storms occur sporadically that create very well timed extreme exposure events to a very different form of PM; 3) we have well-validated, highly resolved?in both space and time?models of both PM and nitrogen dioxide (NO2, a marker of traffic-related air pollution) exposure; and 4) the database is very large with over 8,000 ASD cases across the entire Israeli population going back several years. With these data we will examine the association between maternal exposure to PM, NO2, and dust storms and risk of ASD in her child. We will have exposure estimates on a weekly time scale and can examine susceptible windows of exposure in the perinatal period, and whether any association is specific to boys or modified by other key factors, such as whether the family is simplex or multiplex, to an extent not previously done."
"9206969","Motivational Interviewing (MI) is the only behavioral intervention to date shown to be effective to improve self- management for youth living with HIV. Implementation science is the scientific study of methods to promote the uptake of research findings and evidence-based practice (EBP) to improve the quality and effectiveness of behavior change approaches such as MI in health care settings. A primary challenge of scaling up EBPs is to balance flexibility (adaptation to context) and fidelity (provider adherence and competence). The goal of this proposal is to test a multi-faceted Tailored MI Implementation intervention (?TMI?) based on the dynamic adaptation process to scale up an EBP in multidisciplinary adolescent HIV care settings while balancing flexibility and fidelity. The dynamic adaptation process guides tailoring of MI implementation through a series of phases: exploration, preparation, implementation, and sustainment. The proposed project is a hybrid implementation-effectiveness (Type 3) trial. We will test the effect of TMI on fidelity to the EBP, and secondarily on HIV care cascade-related outcomes, using a dynamic wait-listed design with 165 providers nested within 10 ATN4 HIV sites. With this design, the clinics will be randomly assigned in 5 clusters to receive TMI. For each randomization, 2 clinics receive TMI and the others remain in the wait-list condition. This will continue until the 5th cluster has been randomized to TMI. After one year of TMI?s external facilitation, a second randomization will compare internal facilitator monitoring and coaching plus the encouragement of Communities of Practice versus Communities of Practice alone. Fidelity will be assessed on a quarterly basis through the 24 months of intervention and an additional 6 months of follow-up. We will nest our qualitative method (in-depth interviews) within the quantitative study to provide a deeper understanding of the implementation context and understand why or why not MI is integrated with fidelity across the 150 providers. Providers and key stakeholders will complete qualitative interviews and brief assessments at baseline, after one year of TMI (first randomization), and after 1 year of follow-up (second randomization). We hypothesize that MI competency ratings will be higher among providers during the TMI phase compared to the treatment as usual phase. We also expect that successful implementation will be associated with improved cascade-related outcomes, namely undetectable viral load and greater number of clinic visits among youth living with HIV as well as increased numbers of youth tested and linked to care."
"9182415","ABSTRACT The deterioration of neural circuits in the brain is a contributing factor to the perceptual deficits associated with aging. The long-term goals of our research are to understand the molecular and neural alterations that underlie age-related perceptual impairments. The primary objective of this R03 pilot proposal is to characterize the molecular neuropharmacological alterations to Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which enable glutamatergic inhibition at forebrain synapses. The central hypothesis is that the expression of these Group II mGluRs is altered with age in the neocortex. This is rationalized to result in changes to the balance of excitation and inhibition in the neocortex and contribute to the emergence of age-related sensory perceptual deficits. Several neuroanatomical and neurophysiological features of these receptors have been identified, which forms the basis for the proposed investigation. The specific aims of this project are to characterize the alterations to Group II mGluRs in the neocortex with age by examining: 1) changes in the neuroanatomical expression patterns of these receptors and 2) alterations to forebrain neurophysiological responses mediated by pharmacological activation of these receptors. The proposed experiments are expected to identify the age- related changes to Group II mGluRs in the neocortex and guide our future investigations aimed at directly linking these receptor alterations with the perceptual deficits experienced during aging and ultimately restoring normal behavior in this model system. These experiments will have a positive impact by illuminating the potentially important role of Group II mGluRs in age-related perceptual deficits and as a prospective therapeutic target for these conditions."
"9309833","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) is a national longitudinal study of individuals aged 50 and older in Mexico, with three waves of data covering from 2001 to 2012, and wave-4 planned for 2015. Since its inception, the MHAS has been highly comparable to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the United States, using similar protocols and survey contents. The overall goal of the proposed project is to assess the prevalence and risk factors of dementia and other cognitive impairments in Mexico with a harmonized approach, working with similar studies globally that use national samples and a population-based approach. The specific aims are: 1) Contribute to harmonization in the global study of dementia by launching an ancillary study of the national sample of older adults in Mexico, the MHAS. 2) Estimate the national prevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment in Mexico, harmonized with other countries, by using comparable data analysis strategies and methods. 3) Maximize the utilization of the MHAS data for cross-national dementia studies, by archiving, documenting, and disseminating the ancillary study databases and its resulting constructed variables. The ancillary study will include approximately 3,000 subjects, a sub-sample of the full MHAS wave-4 sample. The databases for the ancillary interview will include results from in-depth cognitive assessments and biomarkers, anthropometric measures, and performance tests. The harmonization goal will be achieved by collaborating with a `coordination project' conducted by researchers of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the United States and through them, with the family of similar studies in the rest of the world. We will harmonize as much as possible, from the fieldwork training materials to the data cleaning, treatment of non-response, and methods used to cross-walk from the ancillary study to the full MHAS sample to estimate national prevalence of dementia and other cognitive impairments. The proposed ancillary study in Mexico will further enhance the analytical power of the parent study MHAS, enabling rigorous cross-national examination of the risk factors and consequences of dementia, an under- studied condition in developing countries that are aging rapidly."
"9207388","Project Summary/Abstract Gay/bisexual/transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) in large metropolitan areas in the U.S., including Los Angeles (LA) and New Orleans (NO), have the highest prevalence of HIV in the U.S. adolescent population. Efforts to engage and retain these at risk youth into the prevention and treatment cascades have generally failed with many not identified as HIV infected or at risk. We propose a multi-disciplinary approach of community outreach, behavioral intervention, and prospective surveillance in LA and NO to identify undiagnosed youth at risk/ infected with HIV & STI. Emerging data of perinatal ?Mississippi baby,? a French adolescent with prolonged HIV remission, and adults with acute HIV treatment with early potent ARV have shown that early and sustained viral suppression is associated with a decrease and accelerated decay of HIV reservoirs (VR), which is likely a predictor of long term HIV control and drug free remission. This contrasts with treatment of already established infection where the ½ life of the HIV CD4 T cell reservoir is stable and more than an average lifetime. We hypothesize that very early ARV treatment of adolescents with acute HIV infection will be associated with decreased VR size, and VR size will be significantly different between adolescents with acute, recent or established HIV infection. Individuals with low VR size may be able to attain extended periods of drug free HIV remission. Through innovative point of care screening of at risk youth N=4,500 and prospective testing of high risk seronegative youth N=1,500, we propose to identify 60 youth with established HIV and 36 with acute infection based on lab assays and Fiebig score. These youth will receive prompt potent cART and be followed for treatment response and serial assays of viral dynamics, decay and persistence of VR [(quantitative assays of HIV RNA, proviral DNA (HIV integrated/unintegrated) digital drop DNAPCR, 2LTR circles, spliced/unspliced RNA), replication competent, HIV antibody, cellular assays (HIV specific CTLs, immune activation markers)] in order to characterize biomarkers predictive of HIV remission (ARV-free undetectable HIV viremia). Viral / immune biomarkers will be compared between groups and over time for rate of VR decay. Treatment of youth who stop/ interrupt treatment will be closely followed for evidence of HIV remission and will be encouraged to restart ARV with viral rebound or clinical symptoms."
"9172622","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Many Veterans have lower-limb amputations due to traumatic injuries or complications associated with diabetes and vascular disease. Walking on uneven terrain is unbalanced and uncomfortable for persons with lower-limb amputations because most current ankle-foot prostheses do not adapt their function for different sloped surfaces. This project will examine the  advantages of a new adaptable ankle-foot prosthesis that can adapt to different terrain on every step of walking using only passive mechanical parts (i.e., without the need for motors or batteries). This new system also provides plantarflexion in the late stance phase of walking, which should increase the efficiency of walking. To examine the potential benefits of the new adaptable ankle-foot system, twenty Veterans with unilateral transtibial amputations will be recruited for the study. During the first visit, the prosthetic ankle torque versus ankle angle curves will be measured while the Veterans walk on a treadmill at five surface slopes (-10, -5, 0, +5, and +10 degrees). Subjects will also walk up and over a series of ramps to examine first-step adaptation to surface slopes. A load cell in the prosthesis coupled with motion analysis will allow for the measurement of ankle torque vs. ankle angle as the Veterans walk on the various sloped surfaces. It is anticipated that the ankle torque versus ankle angle curves will shift towar dorsiflexion for uphill slopes and toward plantarflexion for downhill slopes when using the adaptable ankle-foot system. These shifts in the ankle torque vs. ankle angle curve are not expected for similar use of a non-adaptable ankle-foot system (Ossur VariFlex with EVO). In the second and third visits, the same Veterans will walk with both the adaptable and non-adaptable ankle- foot prostheses over a range of speeds and surface slopes while their submaximal oxygen uptake is measured. For each condition (prosthesis/speed or prosthesis/slope), subjects will walk for six minutes on a treadmill, followed by at least ten minutes of rest (or longer if needed to return to baseline oxygen uptake). During the second visit, subjects will walk at three speeds (0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 m/s) with both the adaptable and non-adaptable ankle-foot systems (in a random order). During the third visit, subjects will walk with both ankle-foot systems on three slopes (-5, 0, and +5 degrees) in a random order. The adaptable ankle-foot system is expected to reduce submaximal oxygen uptake compared with the non-adaptable ankle-foot system for both speeds and slopes due to its ability to store and release more energy than current passive non- adaptable ankle-foot systems and its ability to adapt its function on every step to changes in surface slope. Durability testing of the adaptable ankle-foot system will be conducted in parallel with research experiments. The adaptable ankle-foot system will be tested using the International Organization of Standards (ISO) 22675 testing protocol. Design revisions will occur throughout the funding period to improve the durability of the adaptable ankle-foot system. The goal of the development activities is to pass the ISO 22675 test of 2,000,000 cycles of testing without failure. The research and development activities planned for the new adaptable ankle-foot system are designed to provide evidence of the system's ability to adapt to different surface slopes on every step of walking as well as to increase walking efficiency. These activities will provide useful information regarding the design approach used by the current system, while improving the chances for commercialization of the technology for Veterans."

Our long-term objectives focus on expansion of scientific knowledge and increased use of evidence-based public health programs that advances the national health agenda as reflected in Healthy People 2020's adolescent-focused goals (5 of 7 priority areas), promotes health equity as articulated in the National Prevention Strategy, and addresses CDC adolescent-related Winnable Battles (i.e., reproductive health).  The UMN PRC core project, Partnering for Healthy Student Outcomes (PHSO) is a comparative study of the relative effectiveness of a school-based, social-emotional learning (SEL) prevention program for students attending culturally diverse, economically disadvantaged middle schools in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN metro area. Our primary research question is: Will a multi-year, school-based prevention program, infused with professional development (PD) aimed at increasing the capacity of middle school teacher teams to engage their students in learning, yield changes in middle school students' health risk behaviors and academic outcomes that exceed outcomes from a school-based student-focused prevention program alone? The research has two primary aims:  Primary Aim 1: Conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a school-based, SEL+PD program (Positive Action plus teacher-team professional development and support) designed to reduce health risk behaviors (violence, bullying, substance use, sexual risk behaviors) and increase academic achievement among middle school students; and  Primary Aim 2: Implement a SEL plus teacher-team professional development program and evaluate its effectiveness on student outcomes compared to a SEL program alone.  We will evaluate the two conditions in a matched pairs, randomized trial involving approximately 840 students in 4 urban middle level schools across 3 school years."
"9169521","PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of genome sequencing and functional genomic data in multiple cellular contexts across healthy and diseased individuals provides a unique opportunity to decipher the regulatory and genetic architecture of diseases and traits. Novel computational methods are required that can address fundamental problems involving data representation, data integration, learning accurate predictive models from large-scale datasets and extraction of novel biological insights from complex models. We propose novel machine learning frameworks based on deep neural networks with new interpretation and hypothesis generation engines capable of integrating a wide variety of key genomic data types to learn predictive models of chromatin architecture and chromatin state; integrative models of transcription factor binding; determinants of macroscale three-dimensional genome architecture involving long-range chromatin contacts and the regulatory basis of functional non-coding, regulatory variants. Our methods are highly generalizable to several other related problems in regulatory genomics and lay the foundation for a paradigm shift in computational genomics."

"9230163","X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA, Kennedy's disease) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA is caused by CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansions in the human androgen receptor gene, and is one of nine neurodegenerative disorders that result from polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins. We set out to determine the cellular and molecular basis of SBMA disease pathogenesis. To achieve these goals, we created novel mouse models of SBMA, including BAC transgenic mice containing a floxed first exon (i.e. the BAC fxAR121 line) to permit cell-type specific excision of the AR transgene. We crossed BAC fxAR121 mice with Human Skeletal Actin (HSA)-Cre mice, and documented that excision of the AR transgene from skeletal muscle prevented development of both systemic and neuromuscular SBMA phenotypes, revealing a crucial role for muscle expression of mutant polyQ-AR in SBMA motor neuron degeneration. We produced antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) directed against AR, and upon peripheral delivery, we demonstrated that peripheral suppression of polyQ-AR rescued motor deficits, reversed alterations in muscle gene expression, and markedly extended lifespan in SBMA mice. These provocative findings implicate skeletal muscle as a key site for SBMA disease pathogenesis. To determine the contribution of motor neurons (MNs) to SBMA, we crossed BAC fxAR121 mice with vChAT-Cre mice, and noted a modest, but significant improvement in motor performance in bigenic mice. Hence, SBMA disease pathogenesis involves a convergence of alterations stemming from pathological interactions between skeletal muscle and MNs. We also uncovered autophagy dysregulation as a defining feature of SBMA MN disease by analyzing in vivo and in vitro models, including a human SBMA stem cell model. These studies revealed abnormalities of autophagosome maturation and lysosome fusion in SBMA cell models, mice, and neuronal progenitor cells derived from iPSCs, thereby linking autophagy dysfunction to the onset of SBMA. To delineate the basis of this effect, we considered the transcriptional regulation of autophagy, uncovered an interaction between AR and transcription factor EB (TFEB), and determined that TFEB dysregulation accounts for autophagy defects in SBMA. In this project, we will define the molecular contributions of skeletal muscle and MNs to SBMA by performing transcriptome analysis in our various conditional deletion SBMA mouse models; delineate the cellular basis for MN demise by developing skeletal muscle and MN models of SBMA from patient iPSCs, and determining if non-cell autonomous toxicity can be recapitulated in these stem cell models; and define the basis for AR co-activation and polyQ-AR repression of TFEB by identifying co-regulators whose interactions and functions with AR and TFEB in complex are altered in the presence of polyQ-AR."
"9166775","Project Summary:  Globally, the majority of people (>80%) in industrialized countries harbor latent Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infections in sensory neurons with trigeminal ganglia that innervate the orofacial region being commonly involved. A variety of stressors can reactivate the virus resulting in asymptomatic shedding of virus or in lesions in the orofacial region including the cornea, eyelids and periocular skin. Curiously, while many people shed HSV1 in tears or develop corneal epithelial lesions that are usually self-healing, recurrent disease in some people involves virus replication and vigorous inflammatory responses in the stroma that cause corneal scarring and impairment of vision ? referred to as herpes stromal keratitis (HSK). Repeated bouts of HSK result in severe scarring and damage to the cornea that can progress to blindness.  We speculate that people who suffer from recurrent HSK have gut microbiota dysbiosis that alters host immunity and thereby predisposes to development of HSK. Furthermore, it is conceivable that in these people HSV1 might also reactivate in enteric neurons, resulting in gut barrier malfunction and inflammation, which could cause/exacerbate microbiota dysbiosis. We postulate that as regulators of immunity, the microbiota are important determinants of HSV1 induced inflammatory diseases including HSK and encephalitis (HSE) because oral antibiotic depletion of the gut microbiota prior to ocular HSV1 infection significantly reduced angiogenesis and HSK (4) and our preliminary studies showed that altering the gut microbiota can modulate HSK and HSE development.  We propose two specific aims to test this hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, the objective is to identify gut bacteria, gut bacterial genes/gene products/pathways, and host immune processes that correlate with varying susceptibilities to and severity of HSK and HSE following HSV1 infection. In Specific Aim 2, we will causally test bacteria for their abilities to alter the susceptibilities to and severity of HSK and HSE following HSV1 infection, and identify the associated changes in host immunity.  By demonstrating that manipulation of the gut microbiota can modulate HSK and HSE severity, we anticipate that this project will change our understanding of the pathophysiology of HSK and HSE. We also envision that by validation of our hypothesis this project will spur research to identify and characterize consortia of bacteria (or individual bacteria) with the potential to function as effective probiotics, providing alternative natural prophylactic therapies for recurrent HSK and HSE"
"9229869","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Nathan Brummel, MD, MSCI is an Instructor in Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) with a strong background in aging and critical care research through his prior studies of long- term outcomes in survivors of critical illness and formal training in clinical research. His immediate career goal is to gain the skills necessary to lead an independent, productive program of interdisciplinary aging critical care research. His long-term career plan is to become a physician-scientist recognized as the national (and eventually international) leader in advancing the understanding of disabling processes following critical illness through publications involving better tools by which to understand mechanisms and then design and conduct randomized controlled trials of novel interventional strategies to improve patients' clinical outcomes. Research Project: Nearly two-thirds of all patients hospitalized for a critical illness are age 65 years or older. While these patients are more likely than ever to survive their illness, up to 75% will suffer with newly acquired or worsened disabilities. Thus, there is a looming and under-addressed public health problem that is emerging in the form of large and growing numbers of survivors of a critical illness with life-altering disabilities. A better understanding of the underlying risk factors for disability following critical illness is greatly needed. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are: a) To test the hypothesis that greater activity during critical illness will be independently associated with a lower prevalence, less severity and shorter duration of disability in activities of daily living and mobility at 3- and 12-month follow-up, b) To test the hypothesis that greater activity during critical illness will be independently associated with better physical function and cognitive function at 3- and 12- month follow-up, and c) To test the hypothesis that greater physical activity during critical illness will reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation and coagulation at hospital discharge. Career Development: Dr. Brummel's career development plan integrates formal coursework with personalized training with his mentors and collaborators to: a) develop a strong scientific foundation in the disability process, physical and cognitive impairments after critical illness, the measurement of activity during critical illness, and the biological mechanisms of disability after critical illness; b) bolster his skills in clinical trials and biostatistics; c) strengthen his already robust leadership skills; and d) augment his training in geriatrics and gerontology. Environment: VUMC is the ideal environment to allow Dr. Brummel to become a nationally recognized leader in aging and critical care-related translational research of the disabling process following critical illness. The environment includes a strong team of NIH-funded mentors and collaborators, an internationally known ICU Delirium and Cognitive Impairment Study Group, and dynamic support from the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research. Using data obtained in the proposed study, Dr. Brummel will develop and test future interventions to reduce disability after critical illness that will ultimately impact ICU care worldwide."
"9172207","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Peripheral nerve damage is a consequence of blast injury to the extremities of soldiers and a secondary outcome following cervical spinal cord injury. Functional recovery from peripheral nerve damage is often poor, resulting in impaired motor function, sensory loss, and pain. Clinical complexity and prognosis for recovery is further compounded for Veterans, whose injuries are surgically repaired or revised following separation from the armed forces. This timeline results in a chronic nerve injury, which results in a fundamentally different clinical scenario from acute injury, and one for which therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies are lacking. The significance of strategies for enhancing function of chronically denervated nerves for a Veteran's population is highlighted by the prioritization of nerve regeneration and spinal cord rehabilitation by the VA RR&D Spinal Cord Injury and Regenerative Medicine Program.  We have developed an innovative strategy for nerve regeneration that takes advantage of the inherent capacity of intact proximal nerve stumps to grow in response to tensile deformation (stretch). Our novel, modular internal-fixator device lengthens the proximal stump towards the distal stump in a controlled manner, and will facilitate reconnectivity of nerve stumps more rapidly than other strategies, including gold- standard autologous grafts. Importantly, this acceleration of nerve regeneration will also enable more distal connectivity, which is particularly  crucial to bypass large swaths of the distal stump of chronically injured nerves, which severely inhibits regeneration. We hypothesize that more rapid and more distal reconnectivity will, in turn,  enhance motor and sensory functional recovery.  Towards these goals, we will use an integrative, cross-disciplinary approach to address two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the impact of moderate levels of tensile loading on nerve regeneration and functional recovery in moderate 10mm rat sciatic defects, following acute injury and chronic denervation. In this animal model, which allows us to efficiently and practically test our proposed concept, we hypothesize that in both acute and chronic injury groups, moderate levels of continuous nerve strain imposed on the proximal nerve stump will accelerate nerve regeneration as well as sensory and motor functional recovery compared to autologous grafts. Efficacy will be evaluated statistically by comparing a comprehensive battery of biological, structural, and functional outcomes. In Aim 2, we will examine the impact of moderate levels of tensile loading on nerve regeneration and functional recovery in massive 20mm rabbit sciatic nerve defects, following chronic denervation. The longer length scale in a rabbit model creates a more clinically relevant regenerative challenge, and also enables direct measurement of nerve conduction velocity across the injury site. Based on comparison of biological, structural, and functional outcomes, we predict that lengthened nerves will display dramatically enhanced regeneration and functional recovery across a 20mm gap following chronic denervation, compared to gaps repaired with autologous grafts.  Successful completion of our proposed aims will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of nerve lengthening as a novel strategy for regeneration of previously irreparable injured peripheral nerves. We anticipate that these efforts will contribute to improved motor and sensory recovery for injured Veterans."
"9223371","PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a devastating medical condition that affects more than 1.7 million civilians in the US and represents an unmet clinical need. Effective therapies are urgently needed, as TBI is associated with high rates of hospitalization, mortality, and disability. Previous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate thera- peutic efficacy in patients with TBI. This project focuses on evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of a novel multifunctional biologic?recombinant human proteoglycan 4 (rhPRG4), also known as lubricin?in TBI. rhPRG4 effectively interacts with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, and has strong anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory properties. When administered peripherally in a rat model of TBI, rhPRG4 crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the injured brain parenchyma, but is absent from the uninjured parts of the brain. Our preliminary data show that rhPRG4 dramatically decreases the post-traumatic production of proinflammatory mediators and matrix metallo- proteinases, and reduces the influx of inflammatory cells into the injured brain parenchyma. rhPRG4 also has a unique ability to stabilize the BBB, whose function is affected by TBI. These observations suggest that the rhPRG4 biologic could limit the destruction of neural tissue observed in TBI and, consequently, improve neurological outcome after injury. There are two major goals of this study: (1) to assess the efficacy of rhPRG4 in engaging with its putative targets and enhance our understanding of rhPRG4's ability to stabilize the BBB in acute phase of injury, and (2) to obtain preclinical data on long-term efficacy of rhPRG4 in reducing the neuronal loss and improving functional outcome after TBI."
"9239152","Project Summary Transplantation is currently the treatment of choice for a number of end stage kidney diseases. Considerable progress has been made in the past decades to prevent early rejection of kidney grafts. Yet, long-term survival rates remain poor, due presumably to antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). Although antibodies specific to donor HLA molecules (DSA) indisputably contribute to mechanisms of ABMR, other types of antibodies, especially autoantibodies, have also been implicated. Previous studies from our lab associated natural antibodies (Nabs) reactive to apoptotic cells with ABMR. Moreover, we found that high level of IgG Nabs in pre-transplant serum correlated with long-term graft loss independently of anti-HLA antibodies. Based on this data, we hypothesize that Nabs are important elements in the development of ABMR and subsequently graft loss. Here, we propose to continue these studies by extending our analysis to a larger group of patients treated at other centers. We will also investigate the source of Nabs and characterize the pathogenic potential of these antibodies in vivo. Our experiments will be carried out in 3 aims: Aim-1. To determine whether serum IgG Nabs correlate with ABMR and long-term kidney graft loss. We will carry out a blinded multi-center large-scale assessment of IgG Nabs in pre- and post-transplant serum samples from an extensive cohort of kidney transplant recipients. Serum IgG Nabs measurements will be correlated with donor specific antibodies, other non-HLA antibodies as well as a comprehensive series of clinical parameters including different types of rejection and causes of graft loss. A predictive model will then be built to evaluate the clinical relevance of Nabs levels as a significant factor predicting rejection and graft failure. The synergistic effect between Nabs, DSA and other types of antibodies will also be evaluated. Aim 2. To determine the source of Nabs during ABMR. Using ELISPOT assays we will assess the frequency of IgM and IgG Nabs-producing cells in the blood and graft tissue of kidney transplant recipients and determine whether this frequency correlates with serum Nabs levels and ABMR. We will also attempt to characterize the phenotype of Nabs-producing innate B cells. Aim 3. To verify the pathogenicity of Nabs in vivo. In this aim we will use a mouse aortic transplantation model to study the pathogenicity of IgG Nabs in vivo. Through passive transfer of Nabs and DSA in transplanted mice, we will also investigate the synergistic effect of both types of antibodies. Lastly, we will use a series of mutant mice to investigate the molecules, immune cells and pathways involved in Nabs-mediated vascular rejection."

"9106191","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly heritable, common complex disorder. It is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes in women and the leading cause of anovulatory infertility. Male as well as female first- degree relatives also have metabolic and reproductive phenotypes characteristics of the syndrome thereby substantially amplifying its public health impact. We recently completed two genomewide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with PCOS and its quantitative traits in PCOS women of European (EU) and Han Chinese (HC) ancestry. We mapped common genetic susceptibility loci in women of EU ancestry with PCOS fulfilling criteria for the classic NIH phenotype that confers the highest risk for re- productive and metabolic morbidities. Both PCOS diagnosis and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were associated variants in or near the gene for follicle stimulating hormone B polypeptide (FSHB) at genomewide significant levels (P<5x10-8). In the HC PCOS GWAS, including cases fulfilling the broader Rotterdam criteria, genomewide significant associations were found with variants in or near the gene for luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) and the receptor for FSH (FSHR). These findings implicate neuroendocrine changes in disease pathogenesis. We also found overlap in association signals that reached genomewide significance in one of the two populations in genomic regions not currently known to be involved with the neuroendocrine system, specifically c9orf3, DENND1A, and THADA, which suggests disruption in additional biologic pathways contribute to PCOS etiology. We will test the hypothesis that low frequency and rare genetic variants found in high linkage disequilibrium with these common variants contribute to the defined associations and that the functional consequence of the causal variants will include altered gene expression in the following Aims. 1) To use targeted genomic capture and next generation sequencing to comprehensively identify low frequency and rare variants within six of the associated loci (c9orf3, DENND1A, THADA, FSHB, LHCGR, FSHR). This will be done using DNA from in a multiethnic cohort of three ancestry groups (EU, HC and African American [AA]) in the highest and lowest counts of risk alleles for PCOS cases and controls, respectively. 2) To functionally characterize putative regulatory variants contributing to PCOS and infer potential impact in tissues of interest (theca and HepG2 cells) to PCOS. 3) To demonstrate that variants with a functional impact are associated with PCOS and associated quantitative traits by genotyping the most highly prioritized SNPs in ? 8,500 additional PCOS cases and controls in the same multiethnic cohort of three ancestry groups (EU, HC, AA). If these aims are achieved, the findings will have a sustained and lasting impact on the field by elucidating the functional consequences of genetic variation in PCOS pathogenesis. These findings could identify novel therapeutic targets and genetic variants conferring substantial risk that could be used for disease prediction."
"9281241","Project Summary Sexual violence is a widespread public health problem, with as many as 40% of women and 23% of men experiencing forced sexual contact at some point in their lives.1 The research and practice communities have expanded efforts related to understanding and preventing perpetration of sexual violence, rather than focusing exclusively on preventing sexual violence victimization. The CDC has identified a number of shared risk factors (such as exposure to relationship and family violence, low familial cohesion, and association with at-risk peers) that are connected with multiple forms of violence, including sexual violence. Using a matched pair control design, this study will evaluate the efficacy of a strengths-based curriculum, the Council for Boys and Young Men, to reduce risk for future sexual violence perpetration with middle school-aged boys (ages 12-14). We will collect baseline data at enrollment, and post- intervention data immediately after the course, then at 6 and 12 months after training. We will measure several outcomes linked to sexual assault perpetration, including bystander behavior, attitudes related to gender roles and acceptance of sexual violence, interpersonal relations, and youth-adult connectedness. Factors that impact implementation will also be assessed in order to examine the extent to which fidelity and quality influence participants' outcomes. The results of this study will inform future Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) program activities and expand the understanding of upstream sexual violence prevention."

"9227343","Abstract The objective of this proposal is to use redox amplified radionuclide deposition to enable the non-invasive imaging of pancreatic beta-cells in type 1 diabetic patients using positron emission tomography (PET). It is becoming increasingly clear that diabetes is an epidemic and may be one of the 21st century's greatest health concerns. Molecular imaging tools are needed to monitor the progression of disease, the effectiveness of novel therapeutics, and to track the viability of transplanted cells. However, despite this need, the development of a whole-body molecular imaging technique to monitor beta-cells has remained elusive primarily due to inadequate signal-to-background, which prevents the resolution of target rare beta-cells (~1-2% of tissue) against background pancreatic cells. Here we propose an innovative solution, the amplification of PET imaging signals through enzyme catalyzed radionuclide reporter deposition. If successful, this method would represent a fundamentally new approach to signal amplification in radionuclide imaging. Such methods could dramatically increase signal output from beta-cell specific reporters while simultaneously suppressing background. A fundamental analysis of the problem suggests that such novel solutions are a requirement if we hope to detect rare cells using PET imaging. The development of generic methods to amplify PET signals could lead to valuable imaging tools for monitoring beta-cell mass and have an enormous impact on the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of type 1 diabetes."

Training in the principles of neuropsychological assessment and neuropathology related to patients with dementia will fill out the candidate's preparation for the proposed research activities. One of the candidate's goals is to learn how to integrate multiple methodologies in a new approach to long-term memory research. Results from multiple methodologies converge on a more complete understanding of how functional brain networks support memory retrieval. Three mentors with distinct areas of expertise will advise the candidate on different aspects of the proposed activities, including essential training in neuropsychological assessment, advanced neuroimaging analysis techniques and translation of experimental work into diagnostic tools for clinical populations. The candidate has established a record of productivity with impactful, original research that examines long-term memory retrieval. The proposed research in behavioral neuroscience, and its translation to diagnostic tools for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), will provide  new and important insights about how neural networks support recognition memory. Environment: The exceptional resources and scientific community at UCSF make the university an ideal environment to foster the candidate's development into a successful and creative independent investigator. These institutional resources will give the candidate daily opportunities for interaction with distinguished experimental and clinical researchers from various disciplines. The new Neurosciences Building brings together under one roof many of the key resources needed for the candidate's advanced training (i.e., co- mentors, state-of-the-art neuroimaging equipment and the Memory & Aging Center). Courses and services from the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute are available to the candidate to accelerate his aims to make results from basic memory research more useful for clinical diagnosis of patients with amnestic MCI and different phenotypes of dementia. Research activity: A new psychometric paradigm will be used to acquire objective measures of performance on tests of explicit recognition memory. Results will be interpreted using a neural-computational model of processes (i.e., pattern completion and separation) that underlie generalization and discrimination in recognition memory. Groups of younger and older adults will complete memory tests in the MRI scanner while their functional neural data are collected. Within-group analyses of associations between behavioral and fMRI results will elucidate the functional neural networks that support recognition memory- in particular, high fidelity memory. Between-group comparisons will reveal alterations in the functional networks associated with age- related decline in memory performance. The behavioral paradigm used in the neuroimaging studies will be translated to a clinical tool useful in objective assessment of dementia patients' recognition memory. Finally, additional experiments with younger adults will use repetitive TMS to test the causal role of cortical regions of interest in the functional memory networks."
"9257800","PROJECT SUMMARY  The dentate gyrus (DG) is a subfield of the hippocampus that has been implicated in multiple psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia. Functions of the DG include pattern separation, novelty detection, and the expression of innate anxiety, which have all been disrupted in patients with schizophrenia and in schizophrenia mouse models. While neuromodulators including dopamine are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of hippocampal dysfunction in schizophrenia, the biological mechanisms that underlie defects in DG-dependent behaviors in schizophrenia are unknown.  Most studies of DG function and its role in disease have examined the DG principal cells, granule cells (GCs), and their unique ability to undergo adult neurogenesis. The DG also contains a second population of excitatory neurons called mossy cells (MCs), which have unique anatomical properties and extensive hippocampal connections that position them to modulate DG activity and affect behavior. They have also recently been linked to schizophrenia, in which the schizophrenia-associated protein dysbindin-1 localized to MCs. The involvement of MCs in schizophrenia may be tied to dopamine, as they are the only hippocampal neurons to express the dopamine D2 receptor subtype, and dopamine was recently shown to have a prolonged excitatory effect on them. This is significant in light of the fact that antipsychotics act at the D2 receptor and produce hippocampal changes, suggesting that these changes may be mediated by MCs.  Despite recent evidence that MCs contribute to clinically relevant DG functions and are involved in psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, so far there has been a lack of studies directly examining their role in DG circuitry and in behavior. This proposal will utilize a recently developed Cre-transgenic mouse line in combination with Cre-dependent viral vectors to answer a number of outstanding questions about dopamine inputs to MCs, the role of MCs in the DG circuit, and the link between MCs, dopamine, and behaviors that are dysfunctional in disorders, particularly schizophrenia. The first aim will use a modified rabies virus in MC- selective Drd2-Cre mice to perform monosynaptic retrograde tracing to specifically identify monosynaptic inputs to MCs, especially dopaminergic and neuromodulatory projections. Aim 2 will employ specific optogenetic activation and silencing of MCs in hippocampal slices of Drd2-Cre mice to determine the effect of MC activity on GC output, and the influence of dopamine on the MC ? GC synapse. The third aim will utilize DREADD-mediated silencing of MCs in Drd2-Cre mice in vivo, and probe the resulting effects on DG-linked behaviors that are influenced by dopamine and are impaired in schizophrenia. Overall, this research will greatly enhance our understanding of MC anatomy and function at both a circuit and behavioral level, and will help elucidate the role of MCs, dopamine, and DG dysfunction in the pathogenesis of disorders like schizophrenia."
"9200420","Summary VisionQuest Biomedical LLC (VisionQuest) has developed a diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening system (EyeStar?) enabled by automated screening software (DR-RACS) that was developed under the EY018280 Phase II SBIR project. Our product provides immediate feedback to the physician on the state of diabetic eye disease without burdening an eye care specialist to review those cases without retinal disease. Diabetes affects over 29 million Americans, and DR is one of its main complications. If not detected early, DR leads to vision loss and blindness. With the number of diabetics projected to grow to over 50 million by 2025, worldwide DR has become a serious healthcare concern. DR- RACS will improve DR screening rates by providing a solution that is low-cost and integrated at the point of care, and that will result in increased revenues for insurance companies and healthcare providers. The main objective of this grant application is to complete the final steps needed to commercialize VisionQuest?s EyeStar? DR screening system. For commercialization, VisionQuest requires FDA clearance of the enabling component, the DR-RACS software. This objective will be achieved through two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will make VisionQuest and the DR-RACS product compliant with the quality system regulations (QSR) in preparation for regulatory submissions. In Aim 2 we will prepare DR-RACS for FDA 510(k) submission. To achieve this goal, we will prepare a 510(k) pre-submission, carry out a multi-center clinical study, and submit a De Novo/510(k) application to the FDA. At the completion of this project, we will have the first FDA-cleared automated DR screening software. We will then be positioned to commercialize our automatic retinal screening system, EyeStar?, to serve the needs of the healthcare industry in the US and worldwide."
"9125423","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use disorder (SUD), a chronic, relapsing disorder with limited treatment options, costs the US ~$700 billion annually. A few, moderately effective replacement therapies exist for opiate, nicotine and alcohol dependence. However, no such options exist for stimulant dependence and, further, there are no pharmaco- therapies to prevent or even reduce relapse associated with any drug class. Associations that have formed during periods of drug use serve as powerful relapse factors by triggering motivation to seek the drug. Recently, the synaptic actin cytoskeleton, a critical regulator of memory, was identified as a biological target for the selective disruption of these associations. Indeed, intra-CNS actin depolymerization produces an immediate and persistent loss of well-established memories associated with the stimulant methamphetamine (METH), without affecting other types of memories. However, ?-actin, the isoform implicated in neuronal plasticity, serves critical functions throughout the body. Therefore, efforts turned to an upstream regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, nonmuscle myosin II (NMII), a more selectively expressed molecular motor that promotes synaptic actin polymerization. All results with direct actin depolymerization have been recapitulated with Blebbistatin, a small molecule inhibitor of NMIIs. Importantly, a single treatment with Blebbistatin is sufficient to produce a seemingly permanent loss of METH-associated memories. In addition to its efficacy in animal relapse models, several properties make Blebbistatin an excellent scaffold for medicinal chemistry. Paramount among these are the molecule's small size, selectivity for myosin IIs, high brain penetration, and rapid clearance from plasma and brain (short-acting is sufficient and reduces unwanted peripheral and central effects). Unfortunately, Blebbistatin's activity at cardiac muscle myosin IIs is likely a liability Optimization efforts have been limited because the therapeutic potentials of NMII inhibition have only been realized in the past few years. Thus, the central goal of this proposal is to develop a safe and selective NMII small molecule inhibitor with improved potency and solubility, that retains its existing, advantageous DMPK properties with minimized toxicological parameters. To accomplish the overall goal of developing an IND ready compound, an extensive pharmaceutical approach to drug discovery and development centered on Blebbistatin analogs will be employed, centered on a detailed structure activity relationship approach. A team has been assembled with many years of preclinical drug development experience that encompasses all of the methodologies employed in this project (medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, neurobiology, in vivo pharmacology, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), toxicology, and clinical research), making this team uniquely qualified to direct the program. By capitalizing on the unique therapeutic discovery and development capabilities at Scripps Florida, this proposal is expected to yield a safe, efficacious compound with sufficient preclinical safety data to support human clinical trials focused on SUD relapse."

"9147566","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most commonly diagnosed hematologic malignancy in the U.S. with over 70,000 new cases and about 19,000 deaths due to NHL expected in 2015. Over one third of all cases are slow-growing or indolent NHL (iNHL) which affect older adults and typically present as advanced disease. The initial treatment of iNHL consists of an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab) alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Although first-line therapies are effective in most patients, they are not curative and long- term complications due to chemotherapy are a major concern. Thus, there is a need for effective, durable and well-tolerated treatments for iNHL. Since the antitumor activity of rituximab relies in part on the mechanism of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells, it has been suggested that immunotherapeutic agents which enhance the function of these cells may also augment rituximab therapeutic activity. Interleukin-15 (IL-15), a crucial factor for the development, proliferation and activation of effector NK cells and CD8+ memory T cells, exhibits potent antitumor activities against established tumors in animal models. Based on its properties, IL-15 is considered by NCI as the most promising immunotherapeutic product candidate that could potentially cure cancer. We have generated a novel proprietary IL-15 mutant with increased biological activity. The immunostimulatory properties of this superagonist IL-15 was further improved by creating a complex with an IL-15 receptor ?-IgG1 fusion protein. This IL-15 superagonist complex (referred to as ALT-803) is currently in four ongoing IND-supported studies in patients with hematologic and solid tumors. Initial results from these studies indicate that ALT-803 can be administered to patients at a dose capable of inducing NK cell proliferation and cytokine release without causing significant toxicity We postulate that ALT-803 in combination with rituximab will induce durable, potent antitumor immune responses, which could result in potentially curative efficacy in patients with iNHL. This approach is supported by results of our feasibility studies indicating that ALT-803 activation of human NK cells in vitro can enhance rituximab-directed ADCC against human CD20+ B cell lymphoma cell lines and primary human lymphoma cells. These results were further verified in two efficacy models showing that ALT-803 plus rituximab immunotherapy provided greater NK cell antitumor activity and longer survival than either ALT-803 or rituximab alone in mice bearing human lymphoma cells. These studies provide a strong rationale for advancing ALT-803 plus rituximab into clinical testing against relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) iNHL. Under this SBIR Phase II proposal, we plan to conduct a multicenter Phase 1/2 study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunostimulatory and clinical activities of ALT-803 in combination with rituximab in patients with rel/ref iNHL. Successful completion of the proposed study will pave the way for further evaluation of ALT-803 in combination with rituximab in other B cell malignancies and with other approved therapeutic antibodies in other malignancies."

"9265151","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The function of a brain region is an emergent property of many cell types. The criteria needed to understand a network have been established in studies of invertebrate simple networks, but there has not yet been an attempt to provide such a full, mechanistic understanding of any network in the vertebrate brain. We believe that the time is now ripe for such an effort. Specifically, we propose to understand how the CA3 network in the hippocampus generates sharp-wave-ripples (SWR). These events are of great interest because of their cognitive function: they represent replay of episodic memory sequences and are required for subsequent memory recall, as demonstrated at the behavioral level. Our efforts to understand the SWR will build on previous work establishing the cell types of the hippocampus. However, to meet the criteria for understanding, a great deal of additional information about connectivity and intrinsic properties of cells must be obtained. We will use recently developed large-scale electrical and optical recording methods and ontogenetic to obtain this information. In addition, several new methods/tools will be developed. Notably, we propose to optimize a novel synapse localization optical method to obtain high-throughput cell type-specific information about the connective of the CA3 network. We will also construct the first full-scale computational model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, in which every cell and synaptic connection is explicitly represented. This strictly data-driven, full-scale model will provide a widely applicable tool for synthesizing experimental results and testing our ability to understand the principles that underlie SWR generation."

This trend is concerning because IMRT and robotic surgery are both substantially more expensive than the older technologies they have replaced?start-up costs for each of these advanced technologies hovers around $2 million (Barbash and Glied 2010; Carreyrou and Tamman 2010)?but the new technologies offer no additional benefit in terms of survival for low-risk disease (NCCN 2011, Nguyen et al. 2011).  Moreover, the greater use of aggressive treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer has occurred despite evidence suggesting that more conservative monitoring approaches may be more appropriate for patients with indolent disease. Recent findings from randomized trials of aggressive (radical prostatectomy) compared to conservative (watchful waiting) modalities do not contradict recommendations for conservative treatment of low risk disease (e.g., Bill-Axelson et al 2011; Wilt et al 2012). Several observational studies find low mortality rates among men with well-differentiated disease treated conservatively (Albertson et al. 2005; Klotz et al 2010; Lu-Yao et al 2009). However, these observational studies do not control for patient selection into conservative treatment, despite evidence that patient selection into treatment is significant for clinically localized cancer (Harlan et al 2001). Moreover, previous observational studies have not controlled for physician characteristics, including compensation structure that may affect treatment modality. Previous research has also not fully assessed the consequences of aggressive versus conservative treatment of low- risk prostate cancer for outcomes beyond mortality, including side effects and episode treatment costs.  Our proposed research addresses these significant gaps in knowledge using a sample of men age 65 and older with newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer during the time period 2005-2014. Our data includes Medicare claims records merged with state cancer registry data from California, Florida, New Jersey, and Texas. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1: To evaluate whether and how provider attributes affect type of treatment received after controlling for clinical factors and patient characteristics. Aim 2: To evaluate whether receipt of aggressive treatment compared to conservative management affects the probability of experiencing adverse health outcomes including death and complications from treatment. Aim 3: To evaluate whether receipt of aggressive treatment compared to conservative management affects cancer-related episode expenditures."
"9165131","Project Summary/Abstract The discovery that a subset of mesenchymal cells, termed ?mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),? possesses unique self-renewal and regenerative capacities in vitro has generated immense optimism in their therapeutic potential. Despite the overwhelming enthusiasm to utilize MSCs as adoptive cellular therapy in a broad array of diseases, there is little evidence that MSCs constitute a true tissue stem cell niche in vivo, and it remains unclear if they have physiological roles in maintaining the function of their native organs. This knowledge gap has hindered the rational application of MSC therapy, and prevented insights into the role of the stroma in mediating organ function over time. We and others have recently identified a putative MSC population in adult organs that endogenously regulates tissue repair. Furthermore, we demonstrate that epithelium-secreted factors actively maintains cellular quiescence within these MSCs in the lung, providing a clue as to how the epithelium and the MSCs form a niche to maintain a slow-cycling stem cell population. Leveraging this breakthrough in the identification of putative resident MSCs, our proposal will provide definitive characterization of the resident MSC niche in the lung, and determine whether modulation of the MSC niche can impact organ function in the course of aging. The innovation of our proposal stems from the utilization of our novel mouse genetic models to determine the previously unknown long-term clonogenic and lineage potential of resident MSCs in vivo, and for the first time define the relationship between MSC aging and organ function. Understanding the physiological behavior of MSCs in vivo could provide compelling scientific rationale to improve the application of MSCs as cellular therapy. More importantly, understanding the relationship between MSCs and tissue aging could open up new therapeutic approaches to modulate endogenous MSC function in order to improve organ longevity."
"9148074","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Trauma is the number one cause of death among people younger than 44 years of age, and 33% of all traumatic deaths are attributed to aortic injuries within the thorax. Endovascular reconstruction of traumatized aorta using stent-grafts has evolved as a first line therapy for trauma patients, but these stent-grafts were designed for elderly patients with chronic degenerative arterial diseases and are less than ideal for the smaller and more angulated thoracic aortas of young patients. In addition, the increased patient activity and high cyclic loads imposed by more dynamic younger cardiovascular systems may push stent-graft materials to failure resulting in higher morbidity, mortality and expensive reinterventions over the course of a lifetime. The goal of this project is to create a computationa tool that can determine the optimal stent-graft characteristics for the aorta of trauma patients and the mechanical behavior of the implanted stent-grafts over the long-term. This tool will be able to measure the conformability of the stent-graft when implanted in the young thoracic aorta and the long-term durability of the stent-graft as determined by its capability to withstand high-cycle fatigue loads. We propose to accomplish this by three Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will determine the morphometric features of the thoracic aorta in different young trauma populations (<20, 20-29, 30-45 years old) that are critical for stent-graft deployment using comprehensive 3D arterial reconstructions derived from thin-section CTA scans. In Aim 2 we will build in silico models of stent-grafts deployed in the aortas of young trauma patients using biaxial mechanical properties of thoracic aortic wall obtained from tissue donors of each age group, and experimentally determined mechanical properties of two stent-grafts (GORE C-Tag and Medtronic Valiant) that are currently approved for trauma. We will then use mathematical modeling to subject the stent-grafts to typical cyclic physiologic loads and assess the resulting stress-strain fields. In Aim 3 we will determine stent-graft conformability to the inner aortic wal when subjected to simulated in vivo loads, and long-term durability as determined by the capability of the device to withstand high-cycle fatigue loads assessed by using stress analysis and Goodman diagrams. These data will be acquired for each trauma population to identify specific characteristics of the devices that may enhance the acute and long-term outcomes of endovascular treatments in each trauma group. The proposed study will lay the foundation for in silico comparative effectiveness studies for existing and yet-to-be developed endovascular devices for young patient populations and will set new standards for analysis of trauma-oriented endovascular devices, facilitating the development of better stent-grafts. This work will promote integration of the applicant into the biomedical field and enhance her potential for independent research career while carving out an excellent niche for her to pursue independent funding in the future."
"9230022","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application proposes to continue the cancer prevention programs of the University of Kentucky PRC, the only PRC dedicated to cancer prevention in rural Appalachia. Known locally as the Rural Cancer Prevention Center (RCPC), our past focus has been on the prevention (through vaccination) and early detection of cervical cancer. Through social marketing and planned outreach the RCPC has successfully leveraged the trust of rural people residing in the most economically depressed area of Appalachia (southeastern, KY). The proposed renewal offers plans to continue our community-based cancer prevention research, and to extend our programs to other regions of Appalachia, using sustainable models. Moreover, the previous research pertaining to cervical cancer prevention created a strong basis for testing a novel approach to community-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). Based on new screening technology, this approach will be effective and accessible to medically disenfranchised and under-served rural residents. The proposed plan has 5 general aims (A-E) and a specific research aim (F): A) Provide infrastructure and administrative services that support cancer prevention; B) Build community capacity and actively engage the community in partnerships for cancer prevention; C) Provide an efficient and effective communications network that ties cancer prevention activities together and disseminates health communication; D) Offer training and technical support to state and local agencies; E) Evaluate (process and outcome) all planned activities related to aims A-D; and F) Conduct an applied prevention research project that demonstrates the value of using community change agents to foster widespread adoption of annual colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), followed by navigation to colonoscopy for those screening FIT-positive, and by an intervention program that promote annual repeat use of FIT. All six aims are inter-related; however, the final aim is a highly focused set of activities that occur in two phases: 1) the programs supporting this aim will be tested in Years 1-3, and 2) to benefit other rural Appalachian states, dissemination and implementation activities will be conducted in Years 4-5. Programs to be tested in Years 1-3 include 1) a community-based intervention featuring a Diffusion of Innovations model, standard RCPC outreach methods, and academic detailing for health care providers tested using a non-equivalent comparison design; this trial will end when 500 FIT specimens have been returned in the intervention health district, 2) a social network analysis (N = 64) used to provide interim feedback regarding key characteristics of effective change agents used in the diffusion model, 3) a navigation program (based on current RCPC practices for cervical cancer) that will be applied to people testing FIT-positive (N = 60), and 4)  an internet-based program designed to foster annual repeat FIT screening tested using a randomized, controlled trial design (N = 220). Programs will be designed for optimal sustainability and dissemination/implementation potential."
"9168558","PROJECT SUMMARY More than 98% of the human genome consists of noncoding sequences. The importance of these has been emphasized by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have identified many thousands of common genetic variants associated with human traits and disease susceptibility, the vast majority of which localize to the noncoding genome. In addition, as the cost of whole genome sequencing has dropped dramatically, clinical genomes have proliferated. A major bottleneck in realizing the potential of precision medicine and capitalizing on knowledge afforded by GWAS is the inability to understand and predict the functional consequences of perturbation of the noncoding genome. Up until recently, studies of the noncoding genome have been limited to ectopic heterologous reporter assays, correlative biochemical studies, or laborious knockout experiments in model organisms. Advances in genome editing have enabled facile disruption of human noncoding sequences in chromatinized cellular contexts. Recently we have developed a technique, Cas9-mediated in situ saturating mutagenesis, which allows the high-throughput and high-resolution perturbation of noncoding sequences. We hypothesize that only by perturbation in the appropriate chromatin and cellular environment can the requirement of noncoding sequences be established. In this proposal we describe comprehensive studies to characterize essential noncoding sequences required for erythropoiesis as marked by naturally occurring trait- associated genetic variation. Erythropoiesis is a particularly apt system to investigate noncoding genetic determinants given its predominantly cell-intrinsic nature, direct clinical relevance, and the availability of high- quality human genetic data, extensive chromatin maps, and faithful tissue culture models. With these studies, we will perturb trait-associated enhancers as well as non-enhancer noncoding elements to reveal minimal critical sequences required for erythropoiesis. We will introduce several technical advances, including utilization of alternative nucleases for pooled screening, haplotype-aware guide RNA design, predictions of on- target efficiency and off-target potential, and nuclease target deep sequencing, to approach nucleotide resolution determination of critical sequences. We will utilize bioinformatic, biochemical, and genome editing methods to define key trans-acting factors interacting with the essential cis-acting sequences. The overall goal will be to develop improved models of noncoding sequence function by iterative experimental testing and analytic refinement. These studies are intended to yield an improved understanding of blood cell development, identify novel rational targets for blood disorders, and illuminate fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation and trait heritability."
"9213466","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome wide association studies are powerful for correlating human genotype to phenotype. These studies are designed to identify the polymorphisms in the genetic code that are most predictive of a phenotype. Rapid advances in genotyping technologies enable comprehensive coverage of the genome, including a majority of intergenic polymorphisms. Interestingly, when included in the association analysis, non-coding polymorphisms are often the most highly predictive of the phenotype. Furthermore, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are inherited together in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) blocks. As a result, identifying the causative SNP in an LD block mapping to non-coding regions of the genome remains a contemporary computational and experimental challenge in the field of genomics. Although non-coding regions of the genome are not translated into protein, they are in a majority of cases transcribed in RiboNucleic Acid (RNA). Since RNA is a single stranded polymer, it will fold and the higher-order structures it adopts are integral to numerous RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulatory functions in the cell. In detailed and focused studies of individual transcripts, our team has discovered that disruption of RNA structural features in non-coding regions of transcribed RNAs are causative in at least three human disease states - hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome, retinoblastoma and cartilage hair hypoplasia - and that altered RNA structure determines hepatitis C virus clearance efficiency. The vision of this proposal is to improve our computational ability to predict RiboSNitches (structural features in RNA that are disrupted by a SNP) by improving the accuracy of ensemble suboptimal structure sampling and pseudoknot prediction, and by using chemical structure probing data to characterize allele-specific RNA conformations, both in vitro and in healthy living cells in vivo. Ultimately, this work will substantially improve our ability to predict the causative disease-associated SNP in an LD block mapping to non-coding, intergenic regions of the human genome."
"9227858","PROJECT SUMMARY Systematic reviews (SRs), or systematic reviews of literature, summarize evidence drawn from high quality studies, and are often the preferred source of evidence-based practice (EBP). However, conducting an SR is labor-intensive and time consuming, typically requiring several months to complete. It has been reported that more than ten thousands of SRs are needed to synthesize existing medical knowledge. An Article screening process is one of the most intensive and time consuming steps, which requires SR researchers to screen a large amount of references, ranging from hundreds to more than 10,000 articles, depending on the size of a SR. In the past 10 years, machine learning model training approaches24-29 were developed to accelerate the article selection process through automation. However, they are not widely used due to diffusion challenges.7,14 Major obstacles include 1) a training sample is required to generate the automation algorithm. If the training sample is biased, the article selection process will systematically fail; 2) the automation approach is not made available for non-computer science specialists, therefore SR researchers will not be able to ?fine-tune? the automation algorithm for particular conditions in various SR topics; 3) As there is no global automation algorithm, the generalizability is significantly limited; 4) It is difficult to assess the actual workload saved, while finding every relevant article is required in SR. We propose a new approach to provide views of article relationships in an article network. This is different from other bibliometric networks constructing citation, co-author, or co-occurrence networks. Article network is a simple and logical concept: visualizing article relationships and distribution based on articles' similarities in titles, abstracts, keywords, publication types, etc. SR researchers can also alter the article distribution by adjusting the similarities. This approach does not aim to suggest an end-point of the screening process. Rather, it provides a view of distribution for included, excluded, and undecided articles. In the proposed research, we will integrate advanced techniques to sparsify article networks with mixed sparsification methods, and improve the quality and efficiency of large network visualization layouts by constructing a multi-level network structure and advanced force model. We aim to provide approaches to sparsify and visualize article networks with more than 10,000 articles. Our approach is highly generalizable that it can be used for any health science topics. By viewing the article distribution, SR researchers will be able to screen a large amount of literature more efficiently. This approach can be integrated into current SR technologies and used directly by SR researchers. The success of this project can support SR production on any health science topics, and thus streamline their ultimate application in EBP paradigms."
"9253145","PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile Coach for Parents of Children and Adolescents with Chronic Pain Chronic pain ? or pain that persists for 3 months or more ? is conservatively estimated to affect 20% to 35% of children and adolescents around the world, making it a distressingly common experience. For parents, witnessing their children in pain is often a heart breaking experience. Further, the stress among parents of children with chronic pain poses a significant mental health concern as they experience significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression relative to parents of healthy children. Further, childhood pain brings significant direct and indirect costs from healthcare utilization and lost wages due to taking time off work to care for the child. Yet, few interventions for parents of children and adolescents with pain have been developed to address the unmet needs of this group. Several approaches have been found to be effective at helping adults manage the stress of parenting a child with a chronic health condition, including mindful-based stress reduction (MBSR). However, such time-intensive group interventions are difficult to disseminate, with high attrition rates and limited transportability. We propose a new product which will build upon an established core technology platform: BodiMojo Parent Buddy. The Parent Buddy will draw on evidence-based approaches to deliver an intervention designed to help parents: (1) respond to their child's pain, and (2) to decrease stress through mindfulness-based parenting skills. A major innovation of the proposed product is the development of proprietary Empathic Adaptive Dialog Manager (EADM) based on a theory of emotional appraisal. The EADM technology is designed to provide dynamic interaction and relevant content tailored for parents, based on their coping skills and perceived stress. This approach will deliver real time strategies for coping and communication with a child in pain and self-management parenting skills (e.g., ?take deep breaths,? ?seek support,? or learn to ?let it go.?) The development of an easily disseminated mHealth intervention, Parent Buddy, could bridge an important gap in available parenting support for children who suffer with pain. Furthermore, such a program has the potential to deliver a highly cost-effective program to a wide range of parents. The Phase I proposal will evaluate the feasibility of the Parent Buddy for parents of children (ages 8-12) and adolescents (ages 13-18) years who experience chronic pain, through (1) formative research with parents and health providers; (2) the creation of develop a BodiMojo Parent Buddy prototype; and (3) a 30-day pilot test with 24 parents of children and adolescents with chronic pain and acceptability by health providers."
"9164280","ABSTRACT Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of vision loss in the central visual field, making central field loss (CFL) a major problem in the world today. Two-thirds of patients with CFL complain of vestibular problems, such as dizziness and instability, leading to a high incidence of potentially fatal accidents and falls. The problem is exacerbated by the patient population's advanced age, due to the documented decline in vestibular function in senescence. Vestibular deficits in CFL patients are likely due to miscalibrated or non-optimal stabilizing eye movements - many essential oculomotor behaviors are highly reliant on retinal input. Individuals with compromised vestibular responses have difficulties with visual field stability, navigation, and self- and external motion perception. These limitations are particularly true for CFL patients, whose visual acuity is already compromised and for whom the vestibular system becomes the predominant source of motion information. Furthermore, vestibular deficits likely affect patients' use of head movements to compensate for oculomotor limitations due to eccentric viewing and a patchy visual field. Despite the day-to-day importance of visual and vestibular interaction, these behaviors have not been comprehensively studied in CFL. This proposal seeks to address this gap. The first aim examines the contribution of head movements to smooth pursuit in CFL patients. This aim extends previous work quantifying smooth pursuit deficits in CFL to a more natural, head-unrestrained condition to determine if head movements are helpful or detrimental in CFL. Understanding the contribution of head movements can guide future rehabilitation strategies and clinical testing in this population. The second aim examines the effect of CFL on the angular vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). The reflex has little foveal dependence and is thus likely to be unaffected in CFL. However, foveal vision is known to contribute to both the calibration of this reflex and to its suppression when the head movement follows target motion. A deficit in any aspect of angular VOR will have consequences on the visual instability and vestibular discomfort of the affected individuals. Understanding these problems would inform necessary treatments in this population. The final aim examines the effects of CFL on translational VOR, a behavior that is completely fovea-dependent and is essential when body movement is present. Determining the degree of its impairment and exact influences of CFL is key to understanding vestibular dysfunction due to this visual deficit. VOR responses will be studied during passive and volitional, active motion. Previous research suggests fundamental differences in the processing of these two types of behavior, which indicates that they might be affected differently by central vision loss. If present, this dichotomy could have implications on how patients are advised and trained to interact with their environment while maintaining an active and productive lifestyle. Active behaviors (including head-free smooth pursuit) will be examined during the mentored portion of this project, while passive vestibular studies make up the bulk of the independent research."
"9071067","Project Summary  The purpose of the Translational Imaging Core (TIC) for the proposed Kidney Cancer SPORE program is  to provide investigators in this program with the technical expertise to perform high quality imaging  experiments; to facilitate standardized imaging protocols that allow for easier and more reliable correlation  between results of pre-clinical and clinical imaging experiments; to provide consistent expertise in the  interpretation of imaging results; and to facilitate storage and retrieval of imaging data. The primary  functions of the TIC are to perform magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and Positron Emission Tomography  (PET) assessments of response to treatments in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to provide  imaging methods for mechanistic assessment of targeted therapy in tumor models, and to provide an  image-based platform to guide and optimize tissue procurement through an appreciation of tumor traits  and heterogeneity. Multiple MR imaging and PET techniques will be analyzed in order to maximize the  chances of detecting subtle changes in tumor characteristics and response to therapy. Imaging data will be  integrated with data generated from the Biospecimen and Pathology Resources (CORE B) and the Data  Analytics (CORE C) cores into the Kidney Cancer Explorer (accessible through the web portal  http://qbrc.swmed.edu/projects/kidneyspore/) to ensure SPORE investigators have a unified view of these  data. Lastly, the TIC will provide a ?one stop shop? solution to SPORE investigators for imaging data  storage and analysis both for pre-clinical experiments and human clinical trials with an integrated web-  based Picture Archive and Communication Systems (PACS) and a software solution for image an alysis.  The efforts of the TIC will translate into the development of quantitative imaging protocols that are readily  available for use in clinical practice. These imaging protocols will be applicable at other institutions and will  generate data that is currently not available in patients with kidney cancer. If successful, these protocols  will allow for a change in the current management of kidney cancer patients that is based on quantitative,  objective imaging data."
"9226655","Project Summary/Abstract: We will design and implement a health information technology-enabled system to improve care coordination following an inpatient admission or emergency department visit. Care coordination is required in the absence of continuity of care or when care is fragmented. Americans increasingly live with chronic diseases, and receive care in regions where care is fragmented across care systems and providers. Despite the increasing ubiquity of electronic health records, these systems are often unable to support coordination between clinicians and settings. Resulting failures in care coordination result in billions of dollars in wasteful spending, including outcomes such as hospital readmissions. Although selected care coordination interventions can reduce hospital admissions and improve patient-reported outcomes in chronically ill populations, care coordination programs often fail to achieve their stated objectives and are not globally cost saving. New, potentially replicable approaches to coordinating care are therefore urgently needed. Smartphones may offer a new, more nimble approach to information transfer that facilitates care coordination. Location-sensing technologies are already used in a host of smartphone applications (apps), and have the potential to reliably detect when patients receive care at any hospital or emergency department based on a phone?s Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates. Following exploratory research by our team, the proposed study will develop and test a new system for care coordination in which a smartphone app sends location-based alerts to care managers at a federally qualified health center when their high-risk patients receive care at a regional hospital or emergency room. We will use a ?hybrid effectiveness- implementation? design in which our primary research questions focus on intervention impact and our secondary research questions focus on barriers and facilitators to implementation. The aims of this study are to: 1) Develop a care coordination system in which a novel smartphone app, CHASER (Coordinating Hospital And emergency use with Smartphone-Enabled Reminders), facilitates information transfer and care coordination following inpatient admissions and emergency visits, and; 2) Conduct a feasibility study examining the system?s preliminary impacts and implementation in a care management program for high-risk patients."
"9038505","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive multi-system disease of women characterized by cystic lung destruction, renal angiomyolipomas, and chylous pleural effusions. Lymphangiogenesis is prominent in pulmonary LAM nodules and serum VEGF-D is diagnostic biomarker of LAM. The majority of LAM cells carry bi-allelic inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes and circulating LAM cells with TSC2 loss of heterozygosity can be detected in the blood.            The TSC protein complex inhibits the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) via the small GTPase Rheb (Fig.1). mTORC1 acts as a molecular sensor that regulates cell growth, metabolism, autophagy, and microRNA biogenesis. Pivotal clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefit from treatment with sirolimus (Rapamycin) or its analogs (Rapalogs) in LAM and TSC. Collectively these data indicate that Rapamycin is an effective suppressive therapy for LAM. However, lung function decline resumes and tumors regrow when the drug is discontinued. Therefore, therapy must be used chronically - perhaps lifelong. This highlights the urgent unmet need for novel therapeutic strategies in LAM and TSC and/or mechanisms to allow Rapamycin to be dosed at the lowest effective level, to maximize benefit and minimize risk.            This UO1 brings together a unique team of leaders in LAM research to address key unanswered questions with high clinical impact. First, what are the fundamental mechanisms leading to lymphangiogenesis in LAM? Second, can circulating LAM cell burden be quantitated through next generation sequencing and used as a biomarker of LAM? Third, will finer dissection of the genetic basis of sporadic LAM reveal generalized low-level TSC2 mosaicism?

"8999052","Project Summary/Abstract  The overarching goal of the Cancer Epidemiology Program is to investigate the causes of cancer through  epidemiological studies incorporating genetic and molecular epidemiology approaches as well as risk  factors/environmental and biomarker research that are strongly grounded in the relevant biology. A hallmark of  this Program has been the integration of epidemiology and biology, along with the development and application  of state-of-the-art biostatistical approaches and a defined focus on ethnic diversity that is consistent with the  populations within the USC Norris catchment area. The Program is led by Graham Casey, PhD, a molecular  geneticist who is interested in the integration of cancer epidemiology and molecular biology to develop novel  insight into the complex etiology of cancers, and Duncan Thomas, PhD, a biostatistician with extensive  contributions to design and analysis methods for genetic and environmental epidemiology studies and has had  numerous cancer epidemiology collaborations. Drs. Casey (cancer genetics), Thomas (biostatistics), and  Haiman (cancer epidemiology) comprise the Program's Executive Committee. The scientific aims of the  Program are to: 1) elucidate the role of environmental and lifestyle factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes, radiation) in  the etiology of cancer and study population cancer trends; 2) elucidate the role of genetic factors in the etiology  of cancer with an emphasis on different racial/ethnic populations using existing and new cohorts; 3) determine  the mechanistic and biological basis for genetic risk variants using large-scale fine-mapping and comprehensive  cellular and biochemical approaches, and integrate biomarker and tumor biology studies into epidemiologic  research; and 4) develop and apply novel study design and statistical analysis methodologies for environmental  and genetic epidemiology research in cancer. Accomplishments during the project period include seminal  contributions to the genetic etiology of the cancer field with over 40 GWAS-related manuscripts since 2010,  leadership roles in several international genetics consortia, expansion of the genetics emphasis to study the  biological implications of genetic inheritance through strategic recruitment, development of an integrative  genomics theme to study the relationship between inherited and somatically acquired mutations in tumors,  submission of several P01s, and increased collaboration with Cancer Control Research and other programs,  that includes collaborative grant submissions.

"9238302","Title: MAT Expansion in Rural Oklahoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The State of Oklahoma is among the States hardest hit by a combination of uncontrolled national trends in nonmedical uses of opioid prescription drugs, past-year heroin use, and opioid-related mortality. A highly rural state, Oklahoma is challenged to identify and reach persons with unmet treatment needs despite ongoing State efforts to improve access to community-based substance abuse treatment services, promote awareness of the opioid epidemic, foster safe prescribing of opioid prescription drugs, and prevent diversion. In response to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality?s (AHRQ) funding opportunity to expand access to medication- assisted treatment (MAT) in rural primary care, this project will develop, implement, and test an intervention to support primary care providers in three regions of rural Oklahoma in their adoption of MAT as an evidence- based strategy for treating persons with opioid use disorder. Objectives of the study include:  ? Improving access to appropriate care for persons with or at risk of opioid use disorder (OUD) in heavily  rural sections of the state that face particular challenges with opioid-related morality and/ or unmet  treatment need;  ? Preparing primary care providers to identify and care for persons with OUD using evidence-based and  comprehensive treatment that provides a combination of pharmacologic and psychosocial therapies;  ? Understanding and addressing potential barriers to the uptake of MAT in office-based settings; and  ? Disseminating effective and replicable strategies for overcoming barriers to MAT adoption to help other  rural communities improve access to and quality of care for persons with OUD. To accomplish these objectives, participating providers will be supported in their initiation and use of MAT through comprehensive training, case-based learning opportunities, practice facilitation, and individualized consultation on special topics. The implementation will be evaluated using a mixed-methods pre-/post- implementation design to assess changes in process of care and access to care for persons with OUD, as well as changes in provider attitudes and beliefs to assess the effectiveness of the implementation supports in overcoming known barriers to achieving the full promise of MAT in office-based settings."
"9205461","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor skill learning during development is a process of sensorimotor integration that involves iterative comparisons between a current behavior and a goal behavior. Although cortico-basal ganglia circuits are known to mediate motor skill learning, little is known about the precise mechanisms underlying comparisons of current and goal behavior during development. Vocal learning in songbirds provides an excellent model for investigating how such evaluations are carried out: similar to speech acquisition in humans, juvenile songbirds evaluate feedback of their own immature song against those of an adult tutor (goal behavior) and gradually refine their song to achieve an accurate imitation of the tutor song.  In juvenile songbirds, neural control of the vocal learning process is vested in two parallel circuits that traverse basal ganglia and cortex: a motor circuit drives vocalizations, while an evaluative circuit is necessary for developing an accurate copy of the tutor song. Projection neurons in the motor circuit that drive vocal motor output respond to a variety of vocal stimuli and can thus serve as broadly tuned auditory filters that encode auditory feedback of any self-produced sounds. These neurons send a corollary projection into a cortical target region, AId, of the evaluative circuit, thereby conveying feedback of the juvenile's vocalizations or efference copy of vocal output to AId. AId also receives input from a population of neurons within the evaluative circuit that respond selectively to playback of the tutor song. AId thus has access to a  neural representation of the goal behavior in addition to information about the juvenile's self-produced vocalizations (from the motor circuit) specifically during the vocal learning period, making it well-suited to evaluate self-produced vocal sounds against the tutor song template to direct refinement of the bird's own song. This proposal will test the hypothesis that AId is essential for comparing the juvenile bird's immature vocalizations against the goal behavior during sensorimotor learning. A crucial first step to understanding how information about current and goal behavior is compared is to assess how the information is represented at the site of convergence in AId. Aim 1 will therefore assess the neuronal response properties of AId in juvenile birds in two conditions: (1) extracellular recordings in AId during playback of various song stimuli to investigate the auditory response to vocal stimuli that are important for learning,  and (2) extracellular recordings in AId in singing juvenile birds to test whether comparative signals in AId are activated by efference copy input. Aim 2 will further test this hypothesis by altering normal activity in AId of singing juvenile birds via syllable-targeted optogenetic stimulation. If AId is a necessary site of evaluation, such disruption during vocal learning should  prevent accurate imitation of the tutor song. These experiments will inform our understanding of basic mechanisms of sensorimotor integration in cortico-basal ganglia circuits - a fundamental process that applies to a wide range of learning processes throughout development."
"9202976","ABSTRACT This proposal addresses the problem of sequence bias in next-generation sequencing (NGS) of small RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as fragments of larger RNAs. Because dysregulation of miRNA expression has been implicated in cancer and other diseases, accurate expression profiling of all miRNA sequences is important for understanding miRNA biology and for development of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. NGS is currently the most comprehensive approach for discovery and expression profiling of small RNA sequences. However, NGS expression profiling data underestimate the abundance of most miRNAs in a sample, some by as much as 10,000-fold. Knowledge of the true abundances in samples, and not just the relative changes between samples, is important for reliable identification of miRNAs as biomarkers or drug-target candidates. Other advantages of unbiased detection include the ability to discover novel RNAs and detect low-abundance RNAs that cannot be detected by current NGS methods, especially in samples with a low concentration of RNA. The source of bias in currently available methods of preparation RNA sequencing libraries for NGS is inefficient and sequence-dependent ligation of the two sequencing adapters to the sample RNAs. The major factors contributing to this ligation bias are intramolecular folding of the miRNAs and intermolecular folding between miRNAs and adapters, which affect the ability of the ligase to access and ligate the miRNA ends. Thus there is a need for new, more accurate methods, and most previous small RNA profiling experiments should be re-evaluated. To address these problems, we are developing a new approach, miR- ACS (miRNA-Adapter Circularization and Sequencing), for preparing unbiased sequencing libraries that is applicable to miRNAs and other small RNAs as well as small fragments of large RNAs used in general RNA- Seq. Key features of miR-ACS include (i) ligation of miRNAs with only a single combo adapter (CAD) that combines sequences of the standard 3'- and 5'-adapters used for Illumina sequencing, producing miRNA-CAD ligation products; (ii) circularization of the miRNA-CAD products; (iii) blocking of free CAD species that are not ligated to miRNAs; and (iv) RT-PCR amplification of the circular miRNA-CAD products to produce standard sequencing amplicons containing a single RNA-specific sequence insert flanked by the 5'- and 3'-adapter sequences. In Phase I, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the miR-ACS approach (proof-of-concept) by greatly reducing the miRNA sequencing bias in comparison to the best current library prep methods. In Phase II we will thoroughly optimize miR-ACS to maximize bias reduction and to allow sequencing of a larger variety of RNAs (up to 150 nt in size) with very low RNA inputs. In addition, we will streamline the protocol to facilitate its adoption by users and for commercial viability."
"9237795","PROJECT ABSTRACT Social attachments are a vital part of healthy human behavior and an inability to form such attachments is regarded as a symptom of mental disorders such as anti-social disorders, schizophrenia and autism. Studying the mechanisms underlying social attachment requires an animal model that displays behaviors similar to that of human social attachment. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) have become an important model for the study of the neurobiology of social attachment. In the field, male and female prairie voles form long-term, monogamous bonds and share a nest throughout the breeding season. Such a breeding pair typically remains together until one animal dies. Given that mating in prairie voles induces neuroadaptations that eventually lead to bonding, we propose here to investigate whether mating induced social bonding has an underlying epigenetic basis. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis."

"9197822","This goal of this application is to establish a clinical center at Johns Hopkins University in the MACH14 trial. The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9173420","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Telehealth is the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve patients' health status. Telehealth has been shown to be an effective means to deliver care to veterans in rural settings or in VA Medical Centers without expertise in specific disciplines. The VA Care Coordination / Home Telehealth (CCHT) Program has been highly successful with implementing patient education and monitoring programs using home messaging units for a wide variety of chronic and subacute conditions with over 300,000 veterans receiving care through CCHT in FY2010. Prostate cancer treatment, particularly radical prostatectomy, results in persistent incontinence that in patient surveys is significant enough to require long-term use of pads in 1 of 3 of men undergoing surgery. Although several randomized, controlled trials of perioperative pelvic floor muscle training have shown that it reduces duration and severity of post-operative incontinence for men undergoing prostate cancer surgery, most men do not receive this training because of lack of specially trained therapists.  This study will test an evidence-based perioperative pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to telehealth format and pilot tested in a recently completed Rehab R&D-funded pilot/developmental trial in a randomized, controlled manner to determine if this training can be effectively delivered to veterans using home messaging units. Content is delivered in daily 10-minute sessions written at a 4th grade reading level. Each session ends with a fun fact, often about a famous person with successfully treated prostate cancer. In our pilot study, veterans reported that the home messaging units were easy to set up and use, that they appreciated receiving the training in the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive style of the learning experience, and felt better prepared to deal with incontinence and empowered with new knowledge and skills to help themselves. The control group will also receive the telehealth device, but without the pelvic floor muscle training component to control the use of technology. Content for both groups will include general perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care management; and outcome measures. Only the treatment group will receive the pelvic floor muscle training which is started preoperatively and then continued postoperatively along with bladder control strategies - actively using muscles to prevent leakage, and adherence tips, prompts, and measures.  All outcome measures will be obtained using validated instruments administered via the home telehealth device, another novel part of the study. Data are transmitted nightly to a secure VA database as they are in the CCHT program. The primary outcome measure will be time to continence which is extremely important to the veteran who wants to recover bladder control as soon as possible after surgery, and is the outcome in most clinical incontinence trials. Other outcome measures include scores on a validated health-related quality of life tool specific to prostate cancer survivors; pad use; a measure of the impact of incontinence on daily activities, several other condition-specific quality of life measures, and three validated global patient ratings of efficacy and satisfaction, as perceived by the veteran. Primary analysis will be intent-to-treat, using the Kaplan-Meier procedure and log rank test for time to continence and multiple regression, controlling for baseline for the other variables. A qualitative analysis will also be done, with veterans completing an in-person or telephone interview concerning their experience with the telehealth program.  If demonstrated efficacious, the program could be rapidly disseminated across VA through the Care Coordination / Home Telehealth Program so that all veterans undergoing radical prostatectomy can have evidenced-based perioperative pelvic floor muscle training and improved continence outcomes."
"9207953","Chlorine gas is a highly toxic respiratory irritant that is considered a chemical threat agent because of the possibility that it could be released in industrial accidents or terrorist attacks. Acute effects of chlorine inhalation include dyspnea, hypoxemia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema. Longer term consequences of chlorine inhalation include both pulmonary function impairment and structural changes that have been observed in some exposed individuals. Our collaborator Dr. Erik Svendsen has documented pulmonary function abnormalities in a population of individuals who were exposed to chlorine as a result of a large accidental release that occurred in Graniteville, SC in 2005. The results point to a spectrum of respiratory disease states, but suggest that an important component involves small airway disease. An impediment to developing countermeasures for persistent chlorine-induced lung disease is the lack of a relevant animal model for efficacy testing. Our preliminary data indicate that rabbits exposed to chlorine and examined 7 days later exhibit inflammation of the small airways and develop sporadic obliterative lesions characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). These animals exhibited normal baseline lung resistance but exhibited hyperreactivity to inhaled methacholine. Based on these preliminary data, we propose to expand on these studies to develop a model in which the obliterative changes to small airways are more widespread resulting in increased baseline lung resistance as has been observed in humans exposed to chlorine gas. We will then assess the efficacy of a potential countermeasure when administered following chlorine exposure for the prevention of small airway disease. The hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Increasing post-exposure monitoring time and/or chlorine dose will produce widespread small airway BO lesions that result in significant increases in baseline lung resistance; and 2) Treatment with inhaled corticosteroid plus ß- adrenergic agonist after chlorine exposure will inhibit the development of BO lesions and abnormal lung function. Specific Aim 1 will be to develop an animal model of persistent chlorine-induced lung disease that replicates the disease states observed in chlorine-exposed humans. Specific Aim 2 will be to evaluate a currently available therapy (inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting ß-adrenergic agonist) in a rabbit model of persistent chlorine-induced lung disease. These exploratory studies will generate valuable information toward development of an appropriate animal model for countermeasure testing and will generate initial data regarding efficacy of a type of treatment currently used for irritant-induced asthma that could be readily adopted as a countermeasure."
"9170931","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A vicious cycle of inflammation and reduction-oxidation imbalance has recently been discovered as a critical aberration in a variety of chronic disease, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). In particular, the biomechanical, hormonal, and inflammatory insults to the kidney in the context of hypertension converge on production of reactive species and culminate in adverse fibrotic remodeling. Reactive species act not only as chemical agents indiscriminately damaging cellular constituents, but also as signaling molecules instigating highly specific changes in cellular behavior and differentiation. We have previously demonstrated that electrophilic nitro-fatty acids upregulate cytoprotective responses and allow cells to cope with oxidative insult. This family of compounds has also been shown to be tolerogenic, reducing leukocyte extravasation and cytokine production in macrophages. Our new preliminary data indicate that orally-administered nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) has renal protective effects in a deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)-salt model of murine hypertension. In this proposal, I seek to identify the mechanisms by which NO2-OA affords renal protection in hypertensive kidney injury. Specifically, I will investigate the therapeutic efficacy of NO2-OA on (1) hypertension-induced inflammatory response in the renal parenchyma and (2) antioxidant gene expression in renal fibrotic remodeling. Beyond evaluating a promising pharmacological candidate, the proposed studies will yield fundamental understanding of the role of reduction- oxidation imbalance in CKD. Overall, these studies will provide new functional and mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of chronic kidney failure, and have the potential to uncover two novel pharmacologic strategies for treatment of this epidemic disease."
"9073482","Core B  Project Summary/Abstract  CORE B adheres to good clinical laboratory practices (GCLP) and operates under BSL-2+ containment.  Hence, CORE B is able to work with infectious agents and infectious samples, including HIV positive samples  and those that require worker immunization and/or federal clearance. Any clinical material used in projects 2,  3, 4, 5 will be processed in CORE B as well as tissue from EBV-infected humanized mice for Project 2.   CORE B supports all projects of this program by providing NextGen sequencing, informatics and statistical  services. (1) Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the standard for clinical quantitation of infectious  agents such as HIV and herpesviruse. It is the method of choice to confirm microarray data or data obtained  from RNAseq experiments. We developed real-time QPCR arrays for all human herpesviruses, for targeted  profiling of cell signaling pathways such as NF?B target genes and for human microRNAs. These will be used  in projects 2, 3, 4, and 5. (2) To facilitate NextGen sequencing the core use the Agilent Bioanalyzer for QC of  input RNA and post qPCR analysis, and Tecan general pipetting robot for making libraries of any chemistry  (Illumina, PacBio, 454, IonTorrent). CORE-B also operates a 454/GsJunior NextGen sequencer with 800bp  read-length and a PGM/IonTorrent machine with 400bp read-length. The longer read-length capability has  proven essential for sequencing across viral repeat regions in BAC mutants (projects 2, 3, 4, and 5) and HLA  haplotyping (project 3). (2) Bioinformatics. CORE B supports a full time programmer. It maintains 100 TB of  storage (~10,000 human genomes) and dedicated Linux (128GB RAM) and OsX (64GB RAM) servers, each  with open source and commercial software to support DNAseq, RNAseq and MS/MS protein analyses.  Furthermore, it serves as the conduit to access the wider UNC computing infrastructure and if need be  Amazon EC cloud. (3) Biostatisticis. The core support a full time statistician (MS level and above) and Dr.  Steven Marron, the Amos Hawley Distinguished Professor in Statistics, as a Co-Investigator, who will provide  in depth statistical advice on experimental design and analysis as it pertains to cell culture, mouse and studies  on patient material, such as proposed in projects 3, 4, and 5.

"9136076","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improper food handling practices in the food service setting are important risk factors for foodborne illness. New Yorkers eat out nearly one billion times each year, and two-thirds eat meals from a restaurant, deli, coffee shop or bar at least once per week, so the potential public health impact of unsafe food handling practices in New York City (NYC) restaurants is enormous.  NYC is home to over 24,000 restaurants and 5000 mobile vendors. The NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene is responsible for permitting and inspecting these entities for compliance with food safety and hygiene rules. With support from CDC EHS-Net, we will develop and evaluate a series of food safety interventions to be distributed to the NYC food service industry. We will use data collected during routine inspections to inform content of interventions and assist in targeting the poorest performing restaurants. We will integrate a systematic collection of environmental assessment data into our foodborne outbreak investigation protocol to better understand the environmental factors associated with foodborne illness. These data will be reported to the National Voluntary Environmental Assessment Information System to support national surveillance initiatives. We will also participate in multisite food safety studies proposed by CDC EHS-Net.  We will promote food safety in NYC restaurants and mobile food vending settings using three types of interventions: 1) restaurant operator and food worker education, 2) enhanced training of Health Department inspectors who educate operators during inspections, and 3) regulations and policies. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the food safety promotion tools in use in NYC to inform restaurant and mobile vending food safety programs both in NYC and nationally."
"9244180","ABSTRACT  There are 2.5 million Americans who abuse or are dependent on opioids. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is the most common treatment for opioid dependence. While MMT has been effective in improving drug use outcomes, the overwhelming majority continue to engage in unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., physical inactivity) that lead to significant mental and physical health morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression, sleep difficulties, and cognitive impairments. Given the mental and physical health benefits of physical activity (PA), interventions targeting increases in PA in MMT patients could have a significant impact on reducing the overall morbidity and mortality.  The purpose of this study is to develop a feasible, acceptable and effective multilevel PA intervention that addresses both individual and interpersonal factors delivered in the context of a health care setting (i.e., methadone clinics). To do so, we are proposing to train MMT patients who are already engaging in PA at public health recommended levels to deliver a group-based PA intervention to physically inactive MMT patients at a large community-based methadone clinic. An increasing number of peer-facilitated PA interventions have been found to effectively increase and sustain physical activity levels, though none in substance abusing populations. Peers may play a particularly important role in increasing physical activity in MMT, as this population faces unique and significant barriers to PA (e.g., depression, smoking, triggers for drug use in environment). MMT peers who have successfully navigated through these barriers and are physically active can share information, help in problem solving barriers, act as role models, and offer support and encouragement, thereby helping inactive MMT patients increase self-efficacy and motivation for sustaining PA.  The design of this study takes place in 2 phases -- the R21 phase will be focused on the development of a peer-facilitated PA+Fitbit intervention (Peer-PA+Fitbit), while the R33 phase will evaluate the efficacy of Peer- PA+Fitbit in an RCT. The R21 phase will consist of: 1) focus groups with potential peers and physically inactive MMT patients; 2) development of a PA manual that integrates use of the Fitbit; 3) developing a training protocol for peers; 4) identifying safe, walkable paths in participant neighborhoods, and 5) a 12-week open pilot trial (n=20) to test the feasibility and acceptability of the Peer-PA+Fitbit intervention. The R33 Phase will involve randomizing 150 patients currently receiving MMT to one of three arms: 1) Peer-PA+Fitbit intervention, 2) contact control wellness groups (Well+Fitbit), and 3) Usual Care (UC). Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3, 6, & 12-months to determine both the short- and long-term adherence to physical activity. We expect that this project will lead to the development of a scalable, multilevel peer-facilitated PA intervention tailored to patients in MMT, thereby improving the overall health and well-being of this at-risk population."

"9165580","Project Summary: Synaptic Reprogramming of Adult Neurons The nervous system is largely non-renewing. The adult brain, then, has two choices to protect against neural dysfunction, vigorously maintain existing circuitry and establish new connections when cells or synapses become lost. Despite the importance of these processes, we know almost nothing about the structural and molecular pathways that regulate them. To address this problem, our goal is to define how adult neurons encode synaptic integrity and rewire with new partners. Here, we propose a novel strategy to visualize and molecularly characterize single synapses in order to identify pathways that can modify adult synaptic connectivity. Using the highly ordered synapses of the mouse visual system, we have discovered that subsets of adult neurons can indeed alter their partner choice. This observation is critical for three reasons. First, it implies the existence of neuron-specific synaptic integrity pathways. Second, it indicates that neural maps may be flexible at given nodes, such that particular neuron subsets can structurally tune their connectivity. Third, it suggests that neural adult wiring can be selectively reprogrammed, representing potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We propose to test these predictions in two projects aimed at uncovering the neuron- specific regulators of adult synaptic reprogramming. In Project 1, we propose to elucidate the structural features of this remodeling and define the set of neurons that encode synaptic flexibility both in intact and defective circuits. These studies will use advanced 3-D nanoscopic optical imaging techniques that we are developing. In Project 2, we will identify novel synaptic reprogramming regulators using new strategies that enable single synapse transcriptional profiling from molecularly identified neuron subsets. In parallel, we will test the impact of these pathways on circuit function using both broad measures of circuit integrity as well as directed cellular recording. Results from these studies will identify new basic mechanisms that regulate adult synaptic integrity, define molecular targets for repairing nervous system injury and provide a foundation for the development of therapeutics aimed at maintaining brain health."
"9271099","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is one of the core methods in the study of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Analytical methods, such as qPCR, microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) have increased throughput, but not the reliability of ChIP datasets. Using state-of-the-art reagents, ChIP is at best semi-quantitative, and at worst unrepresentative of in vivo post-translational modification (PTM) density. To address this short-coming, EpiCypher, Inc. has partnered with Dr. Alex Ruthenburg of the University of Chicago who has pioneered a method to internally-standardize ChIP experiments for subsequent normalization and quantitation of epigenetic marks.  The method, referred to here as Internally Calibrated Immunoprecipitation Sequencing, or ICeChIP-Seq, was recently licensed on an exclusive basis by EpiCypher, Inc. and relies on designer nucleosomes collaboratively developed and manufactured by EpiCypher and the Ruthenburg lab. These nucleosomes are modified with an epigenetic mark of interest and wrapped in a DNA sequence containing a unique, identifying barcode sequence. Barcoded designer nucleosomes are added to the ChIP reaction at various concentrations, containing purified chromatin and a bead-attached pull-down antibody against the epigenetic mark of interest. After immunoprecipitation, next generation sequencing data is analyzed for the number of reads detected for 1) each barcode and 2) immunoprecipitated input DNA with the resulting ratio used to compute IP enrichment quantitatively. Read number can then be normalized to input concentration for each barcoded nucleosome, providing a standard curve for quantitation of sample DNA reads. The barcoded nucleosomes serve as calibrators because they are subjected to the same sources of variability the sample chromatin experiences during the ChIP reaction, and they precisely resemble the target of the IP. Proof-of-concept development of the assay has focused on the following: synthesis of barcoded nucleosomes; analysis of their quality; development of an H3K4me3 assay; analysis algorithms; characterizing signal-to-noise ratio; minimum chromatin input demands and day-to-day variability. Given the strong data generated to date, and the urgent need for an improved ChIP-Seq assay, we have proposed a Direct to Phase II workplan toward the commercialization of this powerful method. The Phase I report provides compelling evidence that the method is a dramatic improvement over existing methods, with Phase II aims focused on manufacturing a kit for the H3K4me3 assay reagents, external validation of this assay and expanding the menu of PTM-specific ICeChIP-Seq reagents to other epigenetic marks."
"9028431","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Personalized medicine for breast oncology is in evolution. Currently, oncologists use prior clinical trials data to recommend multiple therapies based upon features of the tumor and clinical stage of the patient. A limitation with this approach  is that these data are averaged from large groups of patients that are then applied to each individual. This creates uncertainty as there is currently no reliable method to identify individua patients who truly have microscopic residual disease after primary therapy from those that are already cured. Thus, oncologists tend to treat the majority of patients with multiple therapies knowing from past clinical trials that most patients do not need these additional therapies, resulting in overtreatment. This project proposes an alternative model that will lead to a paradigm shift in how oncologists recommend and follow responses to therapy. The research team proposes that using the newer technologies of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and next generation sequencing (NGS), plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) molecules shed into the circulation from cancer cells can be reliably detected and measured. They have already demonstrated the ability to detect microscopic residual disease using these technologies in early stage breast cancer patients. The team proposes a transforming project to address specific unmet needs in early stage (curative intent) breast cancer. It is well known that there are subsets of breast cancer patients who upon completion of preoperative chemotherapy (neoadjuvant therapy; NAT) have no evidence of cancer in the breast and lymph nodes. This is termed a pathologic complete response (pCR), and is associated with a favorable prognosis. This raises the question of whether these patients need surgery after NAT, however, patients must undergo surgery to know that they have achieved a pCR. The team will solve this conundrum by determining if the absence of detectable ptDNA after NAT will predict for a pCR and they will therefore define a liquid pCR. Based on their data, the team hypothesizes that >95% of patients without detectable ptDNA after NAT will have a pCR. This will set the stage for future studies to determine if patients without detectable ptDNA after NAT can safely forego surgery and/or radiation therapy, similar to the paradigm shift in treating anal cancer decades ago. A second long-term goal of this work is to determine in future studies whether the presence of ptDNA after NAT identifies a subset of patients with significant risk for future recurrence, which could therefore serve as a platform for clinical trials with new targeted therapies for patients wih detectable ptDNA. Ultimately measuring ptDNA will enable individual therapy options and change the current practice of overtreatment in early stage disease."
"9144760","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In neonatal intensive care using clinical decision support, the focus of this career development proposal is to improve application of evidence-based practices for prevention and early recognition of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among premature infants. NEC is a catastrophic complication threatening the life of fragile premature infants, yet adoption of prevention and early recognition practices (e.g. preferential use of human milk; adoption of standardized feeding protocols; transfusion and antibiotics management) differ widely as do NEC rates. Parents play a key role in NEC prevention (e.g. providing mother's own milk), but heretofore, have been insufficiently engaged as partners. Accounting for 20% of US NICU costs, NEC develops late in the hospital postnatal course and can strike suddenly but until now, no tools to guide early NEC recognition were available. To address this need, a NEC risk decision rule, called GutCheckNEC was derived and validated by our team to accurately discriminate NEC. Integration of prevention practices into clinical workflow using clinical decision support (CDS) has been shown to improve adherence to recommended care across settings. Yet, both the use and evaluation of CDS in NICUs are sparse, and we know of no studies related to CDS support for prevention of NEC. Informed by the Translating Research Into Practice (TRIP) framework for implementation science, in two NICUs using an interrupted time series design, we will integrate NEC-Zero into CDS to fit clinician workflow, optimize usability, and test effects on NEC disease, neonate nutrition and parental satisfaction. The central hypothesis is that adherence to guideline-recommended NEC prevention and early recognition practices (called NEC-Zero and evaluated using an adherence score) will improve when delivered using CDS and NEC disease will decline. First, clinician workflow will be described using workflow maps constructed from interviews with local clinicians and the NEC-Zero integrated into CDS in the form of standard order sets, alerts, reminders and trend data (Aim 1). Then, using a simulated NEC scenario and iterative evaluation, NEC-Zero usability will be optimized (Aim 2). Finally, with an interrupted time series analysis from indicators in the 1 year prior to and 1 year after NEC-Zero implementation, we will compare the trend for NEC disease, neonate nutrition, and parent satisfaction outcomes; then describe the relationship between post-NEC-Zero clinician CDS outcomes (adherence scores, use response rates, satisfaction, perception of unintended consequences of CDS) and NEC disease outcomes (Aim 3). Formal training in usable clinical decision support under the mentorship of Daniel Malone, PhD, RPh & co-mentor Robert Greenes, MD, PhD will complement training in theories and methodologies of Implementation Science mentored by Drs. Marita Titler and Melanie Bell. Over time we will be able to apply the automation and testing of CDS for multi-faceted interventions to other clinical challenges in NICUs to achieve the goal for this program of research, which is to reduce morbidity and mortality from neonatal complications and limit costs."
"9163147","Metabolism in Action: Quantitative Fluxes in Mammals Abstract The molecular connections involved in metabolism are the best understood of any major biochemical network. Nevertheless, metabolic disease remains at epidemic levels, and other diseases involving aberrant metabolism, such as cancer, continue unabated. A key step towards addressing these major unmet medical needs is to understand the integrated activity of metabolic pathways, and their modulation by diet and disease. Despite the recent revitalized interest in metabolism, systems-level methods for measuring metabolic activity in intact mammals remain in their infancy.Here I propose to combine isotope tracing, state-of-the-art metabolomics technology, and computational modeling to reveal metabolic activity at the whole body level. Labeled nutrients will be infused intravenously into mice, tissues sampled, and metabolite labeling quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolic pathway flows (fluxes) consistent with the tracer data will be identified within the context of whole body metabolic model, which encompasses tissue-specific metabolic activity and exchange of metabolites between organs via the circulation. The fluxes will also be constrained by macroscopic measurements like food and oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide and urea excretion rates, tying our approach to classical physiological measurements. Through these studies, we will revisit from a quantitative perspective the overall operation of mammalian metabolism. Anticipated outcomes include enhanced understanding of the sources and consumption routes of circulating metabolites, discovery of novel metabolic cycles connecting different organs, and quantitative measurement methods of broad utility for probing disease models. Application of these methods will reveal disease-specific pathway dysregulation. The overall impact will be a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of metabolism that enables rational dietary guidance and therapeutic intervention across a broad spectrum of diseases."
"9244272","We propose to create a Collaboratory Coordinating Center (Collaboratory CC) to work with the NIH to produce, document, and disseminate standards, and to create durable infrastructure that facilitates multicenter studies and reuse of data. The Collaboratory CC will be based at Duke University, with participation by the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute at Harvard Medical School, the Group Health Research Institute, Johns Hopkins University and the Center for Medical Technology Policy. Our investigators have established multi-center research collaborations using electronic health records (EHRs), convened stakeholders to transform clinical trials, developed new regulatory approaches, and pioneered the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in clinical research. This team has extensive experience in conducting both conventional and cluster randomized clinical trials, quasi-experimental studies, and observational studies across the spectrum of health systems, including integrated delivery systems and health plans, academic health and science systems, and private practices.    The critical importance of this effort is reinforced by recent literature demonstrating that the vast majority of medical decisions are not supported by high quality evidence and that the clinical trials system is focused on small trials without sufficient power to fully inform practice or policy. In the face of this evidence gap the Institute of Medicine has called for a transformation of clinical trials rather than incremental improvements. This transformation should deal with the current fundamental separation of the conduct of clinical trials from the delivery of clinical care by involving practitioners and their health systems in th design and interpretation of trials, providing the broad education needed to enhance the value of practitioner participation and using the data collected as part of healthcare delivery as the core data source for the full spectrum of clinical research, from registries to observational studies an randomized trials. We believe that we are at a tipping point, that if propelled by a powerful Collaboratory effort, will enjoin multiple public and private entities towards the common goal of a Learning Health System.    At the end of the five-year funding period, new policies, procedures, governance capabilities, and a substantial infrastructure will enable larger, simpler, less expensive and more relevant clinical trials that will be an integral component of the healthcare system."
"9081991","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Computer users increasingly have multiple devices, including desktops, phones, tablets, and laptops, and often use applications designed for different operating systems (OSes).  For instance, a Mac user may access a cloud-based Windows remote desktop to run an application required for her job.  The trend toward multiple devices and OSes creates a burden for users with visual impairments:  these users' productivity depends on features of a speci?c screen reader, and these readers are tied to a speci?c OS.  The only current option is to run a different screen reader on each platform-harming productivity incurring additional expense.  The goal of the proposed work is to decouple unmodi?ed, binary screen readers from the original OS platform, giving users with visual impairments a seamless experience when accessing assorted applications running on any platform and any device without having to switch their preferred screen reader.  This proposal is built around the insight that this point of similarity is the semantics of application User In- terfaces (UIs); applications on every OS consist of similar widgets such as buttons, drop-down menus, and text ?elds.  The primary obstacle to porting screen readers across platforms are the degree to which accessibility APIs are idiosyncratic, cumbersome, and varied across platforms.  The novel concept is semantics-preserving virtualization, which is designed around a simple model of application UIs that is both minimal and suf?ciently expressive to represent any application's UI.  This generic UI model is used to drive cross-platform translations, from, say Windows' UI model into the generic model, and then to the Mac UI model such that Apple's native screen reader, VoiceOver, can read a Windows application as if it were running on the Mac.  We will integrate these translations into both remote desktop clients and OS emulators to decouple screen readers from the OS.  The speci?c aims of this project include:  1) Developing a computing systems framework to virtualize user interfaces at the semantic level, 2) Developing multiple proof-of-concept implementations where a screen reader designed for one OS is used to make applications running on a different OS accessible, 4) Exploring a simple programming model for writing customizations and extensions to assistive technologies, and 3) Validating the usability of the system with end-user case studies.  This project will empower users with visual impairments to use any device without a disproportionate loss of productivity-ultimately allowing them to lead more independent lives with improved employment prospects.  Thus, this project advances the vision of Universal Accessibility, that anyone should be able to reap the bene?ts of the information age with any computing device, unconstrained by any disability.  In addition to the practical impact for users, the project will have a research impacton the ?eld of Computer Accessibility and Operating Systems by developing a novel model for application user interfaces and removing systems-level obstacles that needlessly delay advances in accessibility software."
"9252119","ABSTRACT: Half a million Americans suffer from Parkinson?s disease (PD) and the incurring health cost is $6 billion in a year. There are several other neurological disorders with extremely high cost for treatment, but in this context the focus is on the disorders, which have strong connection to glutamate neurotransmission. Presynaptic location of mGlu4 makes them important contributors for glutamate neurotransmission since glutamate as well as dopamine is released from the presynaptic site of the neuron and activation of mGlu4 can inhibit the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA and thus balance neurotransmission through direct and indirect pathways in PD. Several recent publications propose especially mGlu4 as therapeutic target for different neurological diseases including PD. We have extensively investigated positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) as PET imaging ligands for mGlu4. We investigated also biological activity of the developed compounds using pharmacological MRI approaches. These studies opened a new way to characterize compounds and explore their usability for therapeutic purposes. We have synthetized 32 different compounds based on two different chemo-types of the mGlu4 PAMs. Six of these compounds have been characterized with in vivo studies as PET imaging ligands for mGlu4. The main limitation in our developed ligands has been fast washout and metabolism, even though binding affinities have been decent. We also developed specific cell lines to express mGlu4 and the cell studies have been fundamental in ligand characterization to determine the structure-affinity relationship (SAR) of our experimental PAMs and determine co-operative relationship between endogenous glutamate binding to orthosteric binding sites and affinity of allosteric modulators. These approaches are radically different from classical approach in which orthosteric ligands compete with endogenous ligands at the same binding site. Based on the pioneering work and worldwide interest we are looking for to develop especially fluorine-18 labeled positive allosteric imaging ligands for mGlu4 allowing medical applications and distribution of the ligands. Precisely, in Aim 1 we are proposing to synthesize two F-18 labeled lead compounds from the N- phenylpicolinamide- and thiazolopyrazole-based mGlu4 PAMs to study their imaging efficacy, Bmax, selectivity, brain penetration, pharmacokinetics, metabolic stability and other properties. In Aim 2 we will synthesize new series of eight fluorine-containing N-phenylpicolinamide derivatives and twelve fluorine- containing thiazolopyrazole derivatives for SAR analyses. This effort will be supported by computational chemistry. Two best compounds will be selected for the development as PET imaging ligands for mGlu4. In Aim 3 we will conduct in vivo characterization of these ligands using mGlu4 knockout mice, rat and primate models with an ultimate goal to validate the best compound for human studies and obtain IND approval."
"9190290","The lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is approximately 30% among Vietnam Veterans and 11-17% among Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. PTSD is associated with enormous health care costs, increased suicidality, depression, poorer quality of life and functioning, physical health, and increased substance use. Prolonged exposure (PE) is an efficacious treatment for Veterans with PTSD that decreases avoidance of feared, but safe, cues. Despite PE being one of the best available treatments for PTSD, 25 to 45% of PTSD patients still meet diagnostic criteria following treatment. High rates of comorbid disorders, such as insomnia, may interfere with the efficacy of PE and limit long-term rehabilitation outcomes.  Among Veterans with PTSD, sleep disturbances are nearly universal with 70 - 87% reporting comorbid insomnia. Untreated insomnia can persist for years, is independently associated with impaired health-related quality of life, does not resolve following PTSD treatment, and can exacerbate daytime PTSD symptoms. Importantly, insomnia may interfere with the mechanisms of PE through safety learning, habituation to feared stimuli, emotional coping, emotional processing, and cognitive abilities necessary for successful treatment. Despite this, insomnia is not a primary intervention for Veterans with PTSD. Given these factors, it is critical to evaluate whether treating insomnia prior to PTSD will improve PTSD symptoms and quality of life outcomes.  Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first line treatment of chronic and severe insomnia, which produces lasting improvements in sleep. By using CBT-I prior to, and integrated with, PE offers several novel advantages that will: 1) increase client-centered treatment by addressing the number one subjective complaint among Veterans with PTSD; 2) enhance PTSD outcomes and non-response rates by addressing insomnia-related factors that interfere with PTSD treatment; 3) act as a stepping stone and help to engage patients who are not initially willing to engage in trauma-focused PE; 4) increase rehabilitation outcomes by addressing the two leading disorders that independently affect quality of life for Veterans; 5) allow patients to address both symptoms of insomnia and PTSD within a shortened timeframe; 6) increase continuity by allowing patients to work with a single provider; and 7) decrease the risk of attrition between referral clinics and waitlists. To date, no studies have capitalized on available evidence-based CBT-I prior to PE to improve insomnia, PTSD, and quality of life outcomes.  The proposed CDA-2 randomized control trial will evaluate the efficacy of integrating evidence based CBT-I into PE (CBTI-PE) compared to a non-active sleep component plus PE (hygiene-PE) to optimize PTSD, sleep, and quality of life outcomes in 90 Veterans. Our research has three overarching aims: Aim1 (primary outcome): Investigate the efficacy of CBTI-PE compared to hygiene-PE on PTSD symptoms among Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia. Aim 2 (secondary outcomes): Examine the effects CBTI-PE on sleep and quality of life outcomes, when compared to a control group, in male and female Veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia. Aim 3 (Mediation): Investigate whether sleep mediates the relationship between treatment group and the decreases in PTSD symptoms.  Approaching insomnia as an independent target integrated with PE represents a logical, innovative, and empirically-informed method for augmenting existing treatments and optimizing outcomes consistent with the 2014-2020 VHA Strategic Plan. Findings from the proposed study will directly inform clinical practice by investigating whether treating insomnia together with PTSD increases the recovery from insomnia, PTSD, and quality of life outcomes. This translational program of research will help vulnerable Veteran populations achieve optimal and enduring recovery outcomes as well as lay the groundwork for future studies to further investigate the mechanisms between insomnia and PTSD treatment outcomes and other comorbid disorders."
"9163121","PROJECT SUMMARY Diabetes afflicts 366 million worldwide and results in one death every 7 seconds, with 80% of deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, diabetes creates $465 billion in healthcare costs every year. Central to the pathology of type 1 and 2 diabetes is dysfunction and death of insulin-producing beta cells. Our search for mechanisms to prevent beta-cell dysfunction and death, and to regenerate the lost beta-cell mass, led us to organisms with extreme metabolic physiology. Through millions of years of evolution, extreme organisms have arisen that thrive under conditions otherwise pathological to humans. One such group of organisms are binge-eating snakes, whose beta cells survive under conditions that are pathological to human beta cells. We have identified a group of such snakes whose beta cells can withstand hypoxia, hyperoxia, lipotoxic stress, and undergo non-pathologic hypertrophy when these snakes eat their large meals. Further, our data suggests that these snakes possess molecules that can induce desirable phenotypes in mammalian beta cells. The goal of this proposal is to identify the molecules that enhance human beta-cell mass and function. We also propose to delineate the signaling pathways that underlie the other extreme phenotypes exhibited by the beta cells of these snakes, with the ultimate aim of manipulate these pathways in human beta cells using small molecules."
"9167306","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite decades of study, how proteins fold in cells remains poorly understood. Protein folding and misfolding underlies the pathogenesis of diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Much of what we do know about protein folding has been gathered from in vitro experiments, which do not fully model the complex intracellular environment including chaperones, membranes, and other biomolecules. Furthermore, our current knowledge of folding, both in vitro and in vivo, primarily relies on low-throughput, single-protein experiments. While providing great detail, these methods cannot simultaneously test how differential folding and misfolding across the proteome impacts disease physiology. Over 20% of human proteins contain disulfide bonds, and formation of these bonds typically represents the rate-limiting step in achieving the native fold under oxidizing conditions. Therefore, monitoring the kinetics of native disulfide bond formation can provide a proxy for successful protein folding (Mamathambika and Bardwell, 2008). Our group has pioneered the use of targeted mass spectrometry to monitor cellular protein synthesis. Here, we propose an entirely new approach to monitor oxidative protein folding across hundreds of proteins simultaneously: using targeted, quantitative mass spectrometry to monitor the kinetics of native disulfide bond formation in vivo. In my group we specifically focus on the study of multiple myeloma, a hematologic malignancy of plasma cells with no known cure. This disease is fundamentally a disorder of aberrant protein homeostasis: it is thought that unregulated production of immunoglobulin leads to many of the known clinical sequelae, while inducing apoptosis by increasing unfolded protein stress is a first-line therapeutic strategy. Here, we will first develop biochemical and proteomic tools to monitor native disulfide bond formation in nascently synthesized proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. We will then use these tools, in combination with tuning of immunoglobulin protein synthesis through CRISPR inhibition and activation, to test the clinically-relevant hypothesis that myeloma cells are exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibition due to increased unfolded protein stress. Finally, we will test the effects of modulation of oxidative folding chaperones on simultaneous folding kinetics across many classes of myeloma-relevant secreted and extracellular proteins. We anticipate that these experimental approaches will provide a significant advance toward our understanding of global protein folding in vivo, thereby addressing a major gap in our knowledge of this central biological process. Furthermore, our results here will provide a breakthrough toward the study of a broad range of intracellular protein dynamics that are inaccessible with other methods."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goals of this research are to understand the factors that underlie the survival or elimination of particular cells within tissues and how they may affect the success of transplantation and stem cell treatments such as applied to the cornea. The specific goal is to elucidate the contribution of a particular transcription factor recently found to have a novel effect on tissue growth. This protein delays the growth of cells with alterations in the protein synthetic machinery and enables their elimination from tissues. Genetic epistasis experiments using mutant fruit flies will be employed to define the contribution of a family of related bZIP transcription factors to the growth delay an competitive loss of cells, in part employing effects on eye size as an assay. The genome-wide contribution of selected bZIP transcription factors to gene transcription will be determined using high- throughput sequencing methods both in normal tissues and in tissues with alterations in protein synthetic machinery, with the goal of understanding the regulatory processes that control the rate of growth and the competition between cells that occurs in chimeras and perhaps in normal or cancerous tissues."
"9212231","Communication Processes, Technology, and Patient Safety in Ambulatory Oncology Settings The purpose of this study is to characterize clinician communication processes, communication technologies, and adverse patient events in a sample of ambulatory chemotherapy practices and to examine how these practices and technologies influence safe chemotherapy administration. Safe chemotherapy delivery requires effective communication among clinicians to identify and manage adverse events before potentially lethal complications ensue. We do not know the extent to which communication processes such as the use of face- to-face clinician interactions occur in chemotherapy practices. The use of communication technologies in ambulatory care may alter workflow causing increased interruptions, a known contributor to medication errors, and other unintended consequences such as order entry systems that facilitate medication error risks. Specific Aims: We seek to: (1) characterize clinician communication processes, communication technologies, and adverse patient events; (2) examine how variation in clinician communication processes and communication technologies affect chemotherapy delivery practice; and (3) assess barriers and facilitators to safe chemotherapy delivery. Design and Methods: This study will use a sequential mixed-methods design, beginning with a quantitative survey followed by a two-part qualitative phase. Survey results from Aim 1 will provide a detailed assessment of current communication processes and use of technologies, which we will correlate with rates of: 1) chemo- therapy treatments delayed on the day of planned treatment, 2) unplanned emergency department visit or admission for acute adverse events during chemotherapy administration, and 3) emergency department visits for chemotherapy-associated toxicity. In Aim 2 we will select a purposive sample of practices with the range of communication processes and technology identified in Aim 1. We will stratify practices equipped with adequate communication technologies but struggling with high adverse event rates, and practices that do not have a lot of technologies but still perform well. Through observation, clinician shadowing, and patient interviews, we shall explore how communication processes and technology influence the adverse patient events listed above. In Aim 3 we will disseminate data from Aims 1 and 2 to leaders and clinicians in practice sites who will identify facilitators and barriers to safe chemotherapy delivery, so we can develop practice-level interventions for future testing. As these barriers and facilitators will likely vary across clinic performance, we shall elicit barriers and facilitators from practices at varying levels of performance on our three adverse patient event measures. Significance: This study will highlight how variation in clinician communication processes and communication technologies either promote or hamper safe chemotherapy delivery. Our proposed study is one of the few to examine how care is delivered across diverse practices, helping us to inform efforts to organize delivery practices in ways that minimize risks to patients."
"9216666","With the number of Americans who take more than one drug for their well-being increasing, there is an increasing risk of adverse events due to drug-drug interactions. New tools are necessary to understand biology at the initiation of the drug metabolic process, i.e., transcriptional regulation. Since multiple enzymes may act on a given drug, and multiple transcription factors may activate an enzyme, the problem becomes quite complex. In addition, new in vitro tissue engineered models that recapitulate the human physiology are required to get an accurate approximation for the in vivo response of drugs. We propose to extend out microphysiological in vitro liver model to a liver-on-a-chip array to study in high-throughput the transcriptional activity of enzymes and apply it to the study of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Our tissue engineered construct will use both primary human cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived cells. This project will be carried out by distinct research groups. The PIs have a very strong collaborative record of accomplishment. Dr. Martin Yarmush (MGH) will oversee tissue engineering of the liver-on-a-chip and the drug interaction studies.

"9184862","Overview Project Summary  Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is one of the most common heritable disorders of connective tissue. It is characterized by brittle bones, and over the past four decades, the genetics of OI has taught us about the basic mechanisms of procollagen assembly, post-translational modification, secretion, fibril formation and matrix mineralization. In an accelerated phase of discovery over the past 9 years, the identification of new OI genes has further informed us about the determinants of bone quantity and quality during skeletal development and homeostasis. This Program Project Grant (PPG) began in 2010 and has significantly contributed to this rapidly evolving field. In 2006, we reported that mutations in CRTAP caused recessive forms of severe OI (types III and VII). CRTAP is part of a trimeric protein complex including P3H1 and CYB that together are required for prolyl-3-hydroxylation, a poorly understood post-translational modification of clade A fibrillar collagens (e.g., types I, II, and V collagen). We also identified additional type I procollagen binding proteins, FKBP10 and HSP47, as important components in procollagen assembly and trafficking. We and others have since discovered that mutations in the genes encoding these proteins also contribute to the expanding group of brittle bone disorders (BBDs). The overall goal of this PPG is to elucidate the mechanistic consequences of mutations in procollagen and its modification proteins on bone and to translate this into new targeted diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this PPG renewal application, we hypothesize that the brittle bone phenotype in OI is a developmental model of abnormal bone quality and quantity that broadly integrates 1) altered matrix-to-cell signaling defects leading to abnormal bone quantity and cellular function, with 2) altered strength, biochemical nature and intermolecular placement of collagen crosslinks leading to abnormal bone mineralization and quality. To test this hypothesis, we will combine mouse genetic modeling, cell based studies, state-of-the-art mass spectrometric analysis of collagen with continued human genetic gene discovery to elucidate basic mechanisms that will inform genotype-based therapy and diagnostic biomarkers. The PPG will leverage infrastructure housed within the Co-Investigators' programs. The PPG is composed of three projects, a Functional Genomics Core, and an Administrative Core. The projects will answer three important questions. Project 1: What are the downstream mechanisms in WNT1 forms of OI and how do mutations affect osteoblast, osteoclast, osteocyte, and matrix function? Project 2: How do mutations in the FKBP65/HSP47 & PLOD2 collagen chaperone complex affect bone development? Project 3: What are the phenotypic and clinical consequences of altered crosslinking in OI patients and mice with defects affecting procollagen modification and trafficking with regard to bone?"

"9349629","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging is the primary risk factor for the majority of chronic diseases. Studies in mice have implicated specific growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) and proteins secreted by senescent cells as potential modifiers of aging. In response to RFA AG16102, the objective of this proposal is to establish the rationale and provide robust clinical evidence for GDF8, GDF11, and senescence-related proteins eotaxin (CCL11), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI2), as novel therapeutic targets for aging-related conditions. The central hypothesis is that circulating concentrations of GDFs and senescence- related proteins are associated with, and predictive of, clinically important health outcomes and can be altered by physical activity. Samples from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study; the largest and longest randomized trial of a physical activity intervention in older adults, will be used to test this hypothesis. A novel multiplexed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay will be leveraged to accurately quantify GDFs, and an advanced multiplexing platform will be used to measure senescence-related proteins in LIFE Study participants' plasma. In Specific Aim 1, a multidisciplinary team will first determine the extent to which baseline concentrations of GDF8, GDF11, CCL11, ICAM1, and PAI2 are associated with baseline measures of physical (i.e., gait speed and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score), cardiopulmonary (i.e., blood pressure, forced expiratory volume, and maximum inspiratory pressure), and cognitive (i.e., processing speed and memory) function, and prevalence of multimorbidity (based on the ICD-9 codes for 19 chronic conditions). In Specific Aim 2, the degree to which baseline concentrations of GDFs and senescence-related proteins predict longitudinal changes in a) gait speed and SPPB score, b) major mobility disability (i.e., the inability to walk 400m), c) combined cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease); d) adjudicated falls and injurious falls, e) cognitive function (as Aim 1), and f) the number of chronc conditions (as in Aim 1), at the 12 and 24 month study time points will be determined. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will address whether a structured physical activity intervention impacts longitudinal changes in GDF8, GDF11, CCL11, ICAM1, and PAI2, compared to a health education control intervention, and the degree to which change in the concentrations of these proteins parallel change in the health outcomes described in Aim 2. The successful completion of the proposed research will fill an important translational gap in our understanding of how GDFs and senescence-related proteins predict and, therefore, potentially mediate aging related disability and disease in older women and men. Ultimately, these proteins may be viable targets for innovative therapies to extend human healthspan."
"9236348","PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past three decades, extensive health, economic, and social costs have been associated with obesity. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be obese, with weight gain in childhood continuing into adulthood and resulting in the early onset of cardiovascular disease. Such adverse effects are pronounced among women than men. Gender differences are also evident in socioeconomic opportunities, psychosocial resources, and emotional/behavioral coping strategies, suggesting that there may be gender- driven psychosocial, behavioral, and biological, e.g., genetic and reproductive, mechanisms linking early life adversities (ELAs) to obesity and cardiovascular risk. Nonetheless, some individuals who have experienced ELAs do not succumb to cardiovascular risk; they may leverage individual psychosocial resources to halt or reverse accumulated disadvantages from childhood, although the availability of such resources may also vary by gender. Few studies have employed an integrative approach to understanding the broader set of influences on gender differences in obesity and cardiovascular risk. The overall goal of this Pathway to Independence Award is to provide the PI with the interdisciplinary training and research experience needed to investigate how ELAs affect body weight and cardiovascular risk, via the interplay of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological mechanisms, while characterizing gender differences throughout the analysis. Having previously worked as a nurse in South Korea, the PI brings front-line experience to the task of understanding health disparities. During her subsequent training and research in sociology and population health science, she applied theories of social determinants of health to multiple nationally representative data sets. The PI is well along the path to becoming a leading researcher on gender, life adversities, and health. During the K99 phase, the PI seeks training and mentoring to broaden her focus beyond social perspectives to include epidemiological and psychological knowledge of (1) causal inferences in behavioral obesity research (including co-twin control analyses), (2) cardiovascular disease, (3) reproductive health, and (4) resilience. During the R00 phase the PI will develop an integrative life-course approach to study the gender-specific pathways through which ELAs affect risk of adult obesity and cardiovascular disease by combining her primary expertise in sociology with additional epidemiological and psychological knowledge. The proposed research will be based on a nationally representative longitudinal data set, known as MIDUS (Midlife in the United States), which began with 7,108 adults, including 998 twin dyads. Findings from the PI's research should be relevant for development of gender-specific interventions to reduce the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease, particularly for individuals who have experienced adversities in early life."

In 1999, the survey became a continuous program that has a changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to meet emerging needs. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, about 15 of which are visited each year. The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. Findings from this survey are used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors for diseases. Information is used to assess nutritional status and its association with health promotion and disease prevention. NHANES findings are also the basis for national standards for such measurements as height, weight, and blood pressure. Data from this survey are used in epidemiological studies and health sciences research, which help develop sound public health policy, direct and design health programs and services, and expand the health knowledge for the Nation."
"9325113","The overall goal of this project is to generate fine-structure RNA maps in human and mouse (C57BL/6NJ) tissues and primary cell lines using a variety of high-throughput sequencing platforms, to evaluate the biological importance of novel transcripts by determining if evidence of their translated products can be identified. From each sample analyzed, we propose to isolate long (>200 nucleotides) and short (< 200 nucleotides) RNA in biological duplicate. Illumina-based maps for these samples will initially be generated using (1) RNA sequencing (-seq) of ribosomal (r-)RNA depleted long total RNA. (2) RNA-seq of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) pre-treated short RNA (3) Pair-end Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (PE-CAGE) of total RNA. Additionally, for a subset of primary cell lines we will generate the above libraries from nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions. Long RNA-Seq data will be distilled down into functional elements consisting of splice junctions, polyadenylatio sites and de novo genes and transcripts. The short RNA data will be distilled into contigs representing the 5' ends of short RNAs up to the read length. PE-CAGE data will be analyzed to form clusters representing the 5' ends of transcripts linked to a tag internal to the transcript body. Importantly, each element will be assessed for reproducibility using a nonparametric Irreproducible Detection Rate (nplDR) script. Collectively, these data will allow for the detection  of novel transcribed regions and supportive information as to the location of promoter regions and subcellular residence of transcripts. In aggregate, these data will be used to generate models of both noncoding and protein coding transcripts and to distinguish isoforms at complex loci necessary to obtain a comprehensive view of mammalian transcriptomes. For a subset of these samples we will simultaneously collect the genome sequence of the human donors to provide a reference map that will be used to map the RNA data against and derive information concerning allele-specific expression and RNA editing. Unannotated transcript models will be tested using long-range (PacBio/454) sequencing. Lastly, proteogenomic analysis will be done and the results compared against the unannotated transcripts."

"9074408","Project 2: Role of codon and isoform differences in RAS tumorigenesis  Project Leader: Sharon L. Campbell  Abstract: RAS genes encode small 21 kD GTPases that cycle between active and inactive states to regulate  cellular growth. Approximately one-third of all human cancers contain activating mutations in RAS genes, with  codon hotspots at positions 12, 13 and 61. These point mutations render RAS proteins insensitive to down  regulation, resulting in chronic RAS activation and constitutive, oncogenic signaling. As such, they have  historically been considered oncogenic equivalents. However, recent observations suggest that codon- and  residue-specific RAS mutations differ in their ability to function as GTPases switches, engage effectors, and  promote signaling and tumorigenesis. Differences have also been observed in the response and resistance to  specific anti-cancer therapies. Thus understanding these differences will have important clinical and biological  implications. It is also intriguing that cancers display tissue-specific preferences in both RAS mutation and  isoform type. To better understand cancer-specific RAS mutation and isoform differences, we propose  structural and biochemical characterization studies on the KRAS and NRAS isoforms. These studies will be  highly integrated with other components of the P01, and include cell-based and mouse studies to correlate  molecular information with RAS activation levels, RAS-mediated signaling and tumorigenesis. In Aim 1, we will  determine whether codon- and residue-specific oncogenic mutations in NRAS and KRAS differentially alter  intrinsic RAS function and effector recognition. In Aim 2, we will determine whether sequence differences in  the core GTPase domain of NRAS and KRAS drive isoform-specific differences in intrinsic RAS function,  signaling and tumorigenesis. In Aim 3, we will determine how the activity and tumor promoting properties of  KRAS and an oncogenic KRAS mutant (G12C) prevalent in lung cancer are regulated by cysteine oxidation.  Characterization of the redox properties of KRAS G12C will aid in anti-cancer efforts to target this oncogenic  mutant, as well as understanding distinct the phenotypes of KRAS G12C observed in cell-based and mouse  model studies. The proposed studies will help elucidate codon-, residue- and isoform-specific differences that  promote RAS-driven cancers, which will inform the development of new and more specific therapies to target  aberrant RAS function in cancer."
"9103702","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal, titled ELLAS: Environment, Leiomyomas, Latinas, and Adipocity Study (ELLAS), seeks to address the significant gap in our knowledge of leiomyomas in the fastest growing group of women in the United States-Latinas. Uterine leiomyomas or fibroids are well-defined, benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus that represent a significant healthcare burden in women. For the populations on which we have data, largely Caucasian and African-American women, fibroids are present in 30%-50% of reproductive-age women and have an overall cumulative incidence of >70% by the age of 50 years. Fibroids are associated with menorrhagia, anemia, infertility, pelvic pain, and recurrent pregnancy loss. The physiological and psychological sequelae of these symptoms, and the lack of effective medical treatment options, explain why these benign tumors remain the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States. Recent analyses estimate the cost of fibroids in the U.S. to be as high as $34 billion annually. While we know that fibroids disproportionately affect African-American women, there are very few data on either their prevalence amongst Latinas or whether there are risk factors for fibroids that are unique to Latinas. The Latina population has high rates of obesity and diabetes, both of which have been implicated as risk factors for fibroids. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the prevalence and growth patterns of leiomyomas amongst Latinas and to examine metabolic dysregulation as a risk factor for leiomyomas in this population. We will recruit 600 premenopausal Latinas between the ages of 25- 45 for evaluation. Pelvic ultrasound will be performed to determine prevalence and survey data, saliva, and blood samples will be collected (Aim 1). Subjects who have fibroids at this initial visit will return for a follow-up visit in 18-24 months to determine fibroid growth ovr that time and to identify factors related to growth (Aim 1). We will also measure adiposity and various biomarkers of metabolism and glucose regulation, and determine their association with fibroid prevalence and growth (Aims 2 and 3). The results of our study will be clinically significant as we currently have limited data for counseling Latinas on the natural history of the disease or its associated risk factors. Our study design is innovative in that pelvic ultrasounds will be performed on all subjects to identify all fibroids present, not just symptomatic fibroids. Furthermore, the follow-up visit will allow us to collect critical growth data on all tumors. Our prospective longitudinal cohort study will be the first to determine whether obesity and/or glucose dysregulation are associated with ultrasound-confirmed fibroid prevalence, and growth in any population and will thus be of benefit to all women. This study presents an ideal opportunity to conduct a novel prospective analysis on an understudied population and generate data needed to counsel Hispanic women about leiomyomas in an evidence-based way."

"9047624","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifaceted disorder that almost certainly arises (most commonly) from a complex interplay between genetic risk, environmental exposure and stochastic events. Increasingly, it is also recognized that the clinical course of disease is determined independently of the risk of disease. And while some genetic determinants of disease progression have been identified, almost nothing is known about the environmental factors that impact the course of disease. This study will examine the influence of non-genetic factors and gene-environmental interactions on ALS disease progression, and will also explore the influence of gene-environmental interactions on the odds of developing ALS. These goals will be accomplished by leveraging the significant opportunity afforded to us by the recent establishment of the Clinical Research in ALS and related disorders for Therapeutic Development (CReATe) Consortium as part of the NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN). We will add detailed environmental exposure data to the prospectively and systematically collected deep phenotypic data and whole genome sequencing data that CReATe will collect on 500 patients with ALS, and will employ innovative approaches such as case-only analyses and Mendelian Randomization to address our specific aims. Importantly, this work will also elucidate an approach for future meaningful use of the `case-only' environmental exposure data being collected through the online portal of the National ALS Registry. This work, therefore, advances of the over-arching aims of the National ALS Registry and looks to the future as the scope of the National ALS Registry potentially broadens to encompass longitudinal data collection as well as banking of biological samples (including DNA)."
"9177490","Evolution of the nematode intestine: a critical host interface Abstract More than two billion people are infected with parasitic nematodes. These pathogens are a major cause of neglected diseases that lead to mortality and diverse forms of morbidity in humans, while interfering with normal development in children. Parasitic nematodes reduce productivity of food animals and crops which are critical for economical and nutritional well-being, especially for people in developing countries. The control and treatment of these infections is challenged by the absence of vaccines, the limited choice of anthelmintics and evolution of anthelmintic resistance in these pathogens. The biological and molecular complexity of nematodes has further impeded research on development of new therapies for treatment and control. Our research focuses on the versatility of the nematode intestine as a target for new therapies. Our recent progress has established a broad and deep understanding of the molecular architecture underlying intestinal cell functions at the pan-Nematoda level. We also developed a new experimental model to investigate essential features of the nematode intestine as it relates to pan-Nematoda development of new targets for therapies to treat and control these pathogens in humans and animals.  Progress to date has formed a solid foundation upon which the current proposal will capitalize in advancing capabilities to thoroughly investigate the potential of nematode intestinal functions in providing new therapies for nematode infections. Using the multi-omics resource that we have built, we will develop computational schema to identify and prioritize pan-Nematoda proteins/pathways that warrant investigation as anthelmintic targets (Aim 1). Druggable targets among prioritized proteins/pathways will be identified, followed by a systematic identification of inhibitors that can be experimentally evaluated using existing and emerging model systems (Aim 2). Aims 1 and 2 will generate the first large-scale databases of this kind for nematodes, which will have exceptionally high value for our research and that of many other investigators. Preliminary results identified microtubule-dependent apical exocytosis as a high priority process for investigation, which will be investigated in Aim 3, utilizing the Ascaris suum intestinal cell and perfusion model. This research will establish an experimental system to thoroughly investigate apical exocytosis, evaluate chemical inhibitors of this pathway and test inhibitors of other pathways identified from Aims 1 and 2. In Aim 4, progress made in preceding aims will be extended to two other core species, Haemonchus contortus and Trichuris suis, to assess the pan-Nematoda application of findings related to conserved intestinal cell processes and inhibitors.  Advances are expected in establishing a new paradigm in research on parasitic nematodes that is designed to have pan-Nematoda application. Extensive databases resulting from secondary and tertiary integration of existing information offers unprecedented guidance for researchers in the field. That information will be used to guide experimental approaches for the purpose of validating predictions and testing efficacy of inhibitors that may reflect initial progress toward development of new broad spectrum anthelmintics."
"9270946","ABSTRACT Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has high rates of unintended pregnancy, maternal mortality, and perinatal HIV. Increased use of effective contraception could reduce all three. The Levonorgestrel (LNG) implant is a highly-effective and reversible contraceptive that is particularly well-suited to settings like Malawi, where our research will take place. Sometimes referred to as ?forgettable contraception,? the LNG implant provides up to 5 years of protection and is not dependent upon external factors such as regular clinic attendance or breaks in the health system supply chain. Thus, the LNG implant?s typical-use failure rate is very low at 0.1% in the first year. The Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) injectable is the most commonly-used contraceptive in SSA. However, DMPA requires repeat injections every 3 months, leading to a higher typical- use failure rate of 6% in the first year. Recent observational studies suggest that co-administration of the antiretroviral Efavirenz (EFV) may reduce the contraceptive efficacy of the LNG implant, possibly due to pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs. Citing these small studies, some countries in SSA are considering policy recommendations against use of implants for women on EFV. South Africa and the U.S. have already issued such guidance. We argue in this application that the data are not strong enough to support this policy action and propose a 2-part study designed to provide critical evidence to providers and policymakers. Aim 1 will compare the typical-use pregnancy rates of the LNG implant versus the DMPA injectable in a prospective cohort of 1,420 HIV+ women on EFV (710 initiating the LNG implant and 710 initiating DMPA). Women will be enrolled after receiving their chosen contraceptive at their local health facility and will be followed in the study after 1 month and then every 3 months for at least 2 years and up to 4 years. A Poisson model will be used to estimate pregnancy incidence among implant and DMPA users. A marginal structural Poisson model will then be used to estimate the effect of implant compared to DMPA upon pregnancy incidence. Aim 2 will study 240 women in a 2:1 nested case-control study of women from the cohort to determine if higher EFV concentrations in hair (a biomarker for EFV exposure) are associated LNG implant contraceptive failure. 80 women (cases) who become pregnant while using the LNG implant will be compared with 160 LNG implant users who were not pregnant after the same duration of implant use (controls). Conditional logistic regression will be used to assess the association between hair EFV concentrations and LNG implant failure. We will also evaluate the association between being a ?slow? EFV metabolizer with LNG implant failure and assess if there is a LNG concentration threshold at which LNG implant failure occurs among EFV users. The study will be a collaboration between investigators at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in Chapel Hill, UNC Project-Malawi, and the Lighthouse Trust. We will work closely with members of the Malawi College of Medicine and the Malawi Ministry of Health to guide study implementation and any resulting policy decisions regarding the use of LNG implant and EFV in Malawi."
"9207569","The APOE ?4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with accelerated amyloid-? peptide (A?) accumulation both as amyloid and soluble oligomeric A? (oA?), the latter considered a proximal neurotoxin. Importantly, female ?4 carriers have a greater lifetime risk for developing AD, an increased rate of cognitive decline and accelerated accumulation of A? compared to male carriers. Similarly, female familial AD (FAD)-Tg mice have greater cognitive deficits and increased A? pathology than male mice. The link between APOE4 and AD risk is likely multi-factorial and remains poorly understood; while the increased risk for female ?4 carriers remains virtually unexplored. As sporadic AD represents ?98% of cases, with age the key risk factor, the UH2 phase of this proposal will test the hypothesis that aged EFAD mice develop profound AD pathology, significantly influenced by APOE genotype and sex. To study the interaction between human APOE (h-APOE) and AD pathology, we developed EFAD mice by introducing h-APOE into 5xFAD-Tg mice. By 6 months (M), E4FAD mice have greater A?- and tau-pathology, neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits compared to E3FAD. In E4FAD vs. E3FAD, and females vs. males, the levels of amyloid and soluble A? (A?42 and oA?) are greater and apoE/A? complex lower. The critical component uniting these observations into a testable hypothesis is the lipidation state of apoE. ApoE is less lipidated in E4FAD vs. E3FAD brains and in females vs. males. In human brain and CSF, and EFAD mouse brain, apoE lipidation negatively correlates with soluble A?. Thus, for the UH3 phase, our data support the hypothesis that reduced apoE lipidation results in reduced levels of apoE/A? complex, inefficient clearance of soluble A?, synaptic loss, memory and cognitive deficits, and dementia. UH2 Phase: Aim 1: Establish breeding program for 18M EFAD mice and perform benchmark testing for AD pathology. (N=12): APOE4? > APOE4? ? APOE3? > APOE4?. By the end of Year 2, measures will include MWM for behavior, AD pathology by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and biochemistry (BC) including levels of apoE, oA?, A?42. UH3 Phase: Are aging EFAD mice a viable model for the factors effecting AD pathology in humans, particularly APOE genotype and sex, thus providing a model for testing prospective therapeutic interventions and mechanistic hypotheses, including our ?apoE lipidation hypothesis?? Aim 2. Establish 10M, 14M (middle age) and 18M (aged) EFAD mouse cohorts to define disease progression by detailed analysis of behavior and tissue for comparison with 6M (adult) (?3 and ?4; ? and ?). Analyses will include multiple cognitive tests, IHC for A?- and tau-pathology neuroinflammation and neuron counts, and BC for extraction profiles of apoE and A?, apoE lipidation, and levels of oA?, A?42, apoE, and apoE/A?. The failure of AD clinical trials questions the predictive validity of preclinical AD-Tg mouse models that lack h-APOE, the major genetic risk factor for AD. However, the greatest risk factor for AD is age; aged EFAD mice will address both these critical risk factors.  "
"9096650","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBO), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic  immune-mediated conditions of the digestive system that affect an estimated 1.4 million Americans of all ages,  races and ethnicities. Time trends in both industrialized and developing countries suggest rising incidence and  prevalence worldwide. Epidemiologic data are scarce, however, in the United States, given-the lack of a  national healthcare system and of a readily available population sampling method for disease surveillance. The  conditions generally relapse and remit unpredictably with symptomatic flares that may include diarrhea,  abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fatigue, weight loss, and a variety of complications and extra-intestinal  manifestations, including developmental effects in children. Medications are used to control symptoms and  prevent progression by diminishing inflammatory and immune responses, while surgery may be needed to  treat disease complications. The personal impact of IBO varies widely among individuals, however, and likely  reflects individual differences in disease biology, variations in the timing and choice of therapies, and disparate  psychosocial and economic characteristics. Understanding the impact of IBO on affected individuals, and the  biological, medical and psychosocial determinants of that impact, is critical if individual outcomes are to be  improved through rationally designed interventions. In addition, if a national surveillance program for IBO could  be created, disease trends in the US could be tracked, with appropriate dedication of resources to meet the  population's needs. The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA) is the nation's largest non-profit  organization devoted to lBO, with robust lay and professional involvement. Through advocacy, research grants  and initiatives supported through its own fundraising efforts, and a long-standing collaboration with the CDC  through earlier U01 research cooperative agreements, the CCFA has been working to achieve an improved  understanding of the epidemiology of IBO and the basis of disease heterogeneity as a means of improving  outcomes. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the population health needs of  individuals afflicted with lBO, and to design and implement interventions to improve their disease  outcomes. This proposal leverages the unique assets of the CCFA to address key issues in the epidemiology  and outcomes of IBO. These include coordination and involvement of lay stakeholders; an active National  Scientific Advisory Committee with Professional Affairs and Patient Education Committees dedicated to  creating and disseminating significant interventions; a website and a variety of other avenues to channel  information to patients and providers; CCFA Partners, a novel online cohort of patients with self-reported  disease outcomes, and OSCCAR (the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry), a unique, community-based  prospective IBO inception cohort created through the CCFA's work with the CDC over the last 5 years."
"9145645","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication discrepancies, i.e., unexplained differences in medication regimens across different sites of care, are very common and represent a major threat to patient safety. One solution is medication reconciliation. The AHRQ-funded Multi-Center Medication Reconciliation Quality Improvement Study (MARQUIS) conducted at five US hospitals consolidated best practices and rigorously evaluated them in a real-world setting. Results showed significant reductions in potentially harmful medication discrepancies. The MARQUIS toolkit, now refined based on lessons learned from the prior study, provides a scalable and testable approach to markedly improve medication safety at numerous institutions.  The long-term objective of this research is to widely disseminate, implement, and evaluate sustainable medication reconciliation interventions that improve patient safety during care transitions. We aim to implement the refined MARQUIS toolkit at 18 diverse hospitals using a mentored implementation model, to rigorously evaluate the effects on unintentional medication discrepancies, and to evaluate the success of implementation using the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) to inform future dissemination.  Prospective sites will be selected based on their interest and on their readiness to participate (e.g., demonstration of institutional support and data collection resources). Mentors will conduct one site visit and monthly phone calls to assist local site leaders with implementation. The MARQUIS toolkit will include a core medication reconciliation bundle; the use of more intensive interventions in high-risk patients; provider training and the use of dedicated personnel for certain tasks (e.g., discharge medication counseling); improving access to pre-admission medication sources (e.g., by empowering patients to maintain their own medication lists); improving implementation of information technology; and social marketing techniques aimed at both patients and providers. The primary outcome will be the number of unintentional medication discrepancies in admission and discharge orders using methods refined over several studies and analyzed using segmented regression methods to measure improvement over baseline temporal trends. Program evaluation using RE-AIM will provide lessons to inform the spread of future medication reconciliation interventions. A Patient-Family Advisory Council will ensure that patients assume a vital role in the research effort. Dissemination plans will be developed with input from a multi-stakeholder team.  This project will provide valuable information regarding the most effective ways to support safe medication use and improve health care delivery during care transitions."
"9123760","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular targets for vitreoretinopathy and uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery of a calcium-activated protease, CAPN5 (calpain-5), as the cause of Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV), and that CAPN5 processes PDGFB signaling. CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene, and makes possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach for mechanism-based therapies for inflammation induced by photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptors express CAPN5, and an hCAPN5-R243L gain of function mutation in mice shows all the phenotypes of human ADNIV disease. The retina photoreceptors might be particularly sensitive to mutations in CAPN5, because high intracellular calcium is necessary and sufficient to regulate dark adaptation in photoreceptors. Our long-term goals are to find better and more specific treatments for inflammatory vitreoretinopathy. Our objective is to use in vitro and in vivo cell culture and mouse models to determine the mechanisms responsible for controlling activity of CAPN5. We will also investigate how uncontrolled CAPN5 activity leads to aberrant signaling of one of its substrates, platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB), and how this signaling results in the subsequent ADNIV phenotypes. Our central hypothesis is that an uncontrolled, calcium-activated CAPN5 pathway leads to ADNIV retinal degeneration and uveitis through aberrant PDGFB signaling. By creating a new mouse model we will be able to identify new therapeutic targets. Our specific aims are to (1) Dissect the ADNIV CAPN5 autoproteolysis effect in cells, (2) Determine if ADNIV CAPN5 hyperactively cleaves PDGFB to upregulate signaling, and (3) Test if PDGFB loss rescues the ADNIV phenotype in a preclinical mouse model. Impact. We expect to gain not only a better understanding of calpain activity and the role PDGFB plays in eye disease, but also to identify new therapeutic targets that may be applicable to many eye diseases. Our work should help determine the role of PDGFB signaling in ADNIV and other vitreoretinal degenerative diseases."
"9237359","Project Summary Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a common complication of anticancer treatments due to extreme toxicity of chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. In female cancer survivors POF causes sterility, along with the consequences of absent ovarian endocrine function: premature osteopenia and muscle wasting, and accelerated cardiovascular diseases. These long lasting effects are significant, particularly for young girls reaching puberty. The overall goal of the proposal is to develop means to restore ovarian endocrine function in young women with POF by utilizing allogeneic transplantation of ovarian tissue. We will engineer an advanced synthetic hydrogel carrier with spatially controlled degradation to provide a dynamic environment to support prolonged survival and function of the allogeneic ovarian transplant. First, we will investigate how the physical properties of the hydrogel, such as stiffness, degradation rate and pore size affect tissue survival and physiological function and longevity. We will design a dual hydrogel system, with a degradable core to support follicle growth and function, and non-degradable immune-isolating shell. The shell will prevent the infiltration of the immune cells into the graft and leaking of the implanted cells from the graft. Second, we will investigate how graft size and composition (the balance between stromal cells, and early and late stage follicles) determines graft longevity. Ovarian follicles have an ?expiration date? and degenerate after one cycle, thus the initial number of the follicles in the graft sets up the maximum longevity of the graft. Other factors, like hypoxia and stiff environment, can limit the function of the graft. We will determine the optimal size and composition of the follicular pool that maximize graft longevity and function a syngeneic mouse model. Lastly, we will determine whether immunity against the graft limits graft function. We will investigate the mechanism and the timeline of the ovarian graft rejection and answer two questions: 1) is the recipient sensitized to the allogeneic tissue encapsulated in the hydrogel and 2) whether T cells infiltrate through the protective layer around the graft and destroy the tissue. With respect to outcomes, this project will engineer an immunoisolating system for allotransplantation of the ovarian tissue and will present a real clinical opportunity to initiate normal puberty in young women with POF. 1"
"9192322","Background: Obesity is a major risk factor for mobility limitation in older adults. It is estimated that 11 million older adults have mobility disability and > 4 million older adults use walking assistive devices. Mobility disability results in decreased economy of gait, physical deconditioning and reduced peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak). Impaired economy of gait and decreased physiological reserve may lead to increased fatigue, reduced endurance, and ultimately contribute to reduced functional independence. The optimal intervention to improve mobility limitations in older, obese adults is not known, particular in those who use walking assistive devices, and there is limited information on whether improvements in physical function can be sustained over time. Preliminary studies demonstrate that our novel progressive group multimodal balance intervention (MMBI), focusing on lateral movements, lower extremity strengthening and dynamic obstacle negotiation can improve gait, balance, and strength in mobility limited older adults. However, it is no known if weight loss in combination with MMBI will provide additive or synergistic improvements in mobility limited older, obese Veterans. We hypothesize that our MMBI program in combination with a hypocaloric nutritional intervention (Nutrition) will be more effective than MMBI alone in improving muscle quality, physical function and economy of gait. In addition, we hypothesize that the Nutrition + MMBI will be more effective than MMBI alone at improving self- reported measures of function and disability. Objective: We propose a randomized clinical trial in 120 older (age > 60 yr) community-dwelling obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), Veterans with mobility limitations who use walking assistive devices in which we will: Specific aim 1: Compare the effects of a 6-month MMBI intervention alone to a 6-month combination Nutrition + MMBI on physical functioning and economy of gait. Specific aim 2: Compare the effects of the two interventions on body composition, muscle mass, strength and relative sarcopenia. Specific aim 3: Assess the effects of the two interventions at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months on their self- reported measures of function and disability using the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI). Methods: Veterans enrolled into the study will have baseline testing at the Baltimore GRECC and VAMHCS Human Performance Laboratory consisting of 1) performance-based outcome measures include VO2peak, gait speed (gait rite), chair stands, lateral mobility and balance (four square step test, figure eight), SPPB, handgrip strength (dynamometry), and economy of gait (portable VO2 measurement during 6 minute walk) and functional status (ADL, IADLs); 2) lower extremity strength testing, 3) total body DXA scan, and a CT scan of the abdomen, hips and thighs for determination of lower extremity and core muscle composition; and 4) biomarkers. After completion of baseline testing, the Veterans will be randomized to one of the two interventions. Nutrition classes will be led by a GRECC dietitian. The goal is for subjects to lose 10% of their weight over the first 6 months with gradual weight loss after that. The MMBI will consist of a group dynamic balance class, a supervised obstacle course, and lower extremity and core strengthening. After 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months, subjects will repeat the assessments that they had at baseline. Impact: Few exercise rehabilitation studies target older, obese Veterans who use walking assistive device and indeed individuals who use walking assistive devices are often excluded from the studies. This research directly benefits Veterans as it may lead to more effective interventions that improve mobility, reduce fall risk, and reduce injury-related hospitalization and death in older Veterans with mobility limitations. This nutritional and multimodal balance intervention is readily exportable to the community and with additional resources could be widely implemented at other VAs as part of clinical care."
"9120239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing obesity, through improved nutrition and increased physical activity is one of the goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles initiative. Reducing obesity in rural residents is especially important since they are more likely to be obese than urban residents. Indeed, Iowa residents rank 33rd of 50 states in the percent of residents who are obese and half of Iowa's adults do not meet PA recommendations. Effective interventions to increase PA in rural micropolitan (<50,000 residents) communities are scant since most evidence-based interventions have been tested in urban or suburban areas. In the Midwest, these micropolitan communities are also new destination locations for an influx of Latino populations. The Prevention Research Center for Rural Health (PRC-RH), with a focus on obesity, addresses the health challenges of residents of micropolitan and other rural communities in Iowa through a variety of Center activities and resources as well as the implementation of an intervention research project, ActiveOttumwa. PRC-RH Center activities include maintenance of an infrastructure with cores focusing on community engagement, communication and dissemination of PRC-RH research and best practices, training of public health professionals, students and community members, and evaluation of PRC-RH activities. The PRC-RH has vibrant partnerships with the Iowa Department of Public Health, an active Community Advisory Board, with local health department and community organization representation, in Ottumwa, Iowa, a micropolitan new destination community. The PRC-RH intervention research project, Active Ottumwa focuses on increasing physical activity in Ottumwa by determining the effectiveness of a community-based PA intervention that uses a lay health advisor (LHA) approach - to implement evidence-based PA strategies. Based on the available evidence and strategies from the Community Guide, the Active Ottumwa will implement activities at three levels of influence: 1) community-wide campaigns (e.g. newspaper, TV, and radio announcements, website exposure and public health education programs; 2) behavioral and social support interventions (e.g. behavioral contracts, buddy systems, goal-setting to promote and support PA activities; and 3) land-use policies and access to places for PA, (.e.g. working with local governmental officials and agencies and community leaders to advocate, improve and create opportunities for access and use of facilities for PA). To evaluate Active Ottumwa, mixed methods will be used including a community-wide survey; longitudinal follow up of a cohort of residents that will complete accelerometry, physical and anthropometric measures and survey data; observational measures; key informant in-depth interviews; and project documentation. The research project and PRC-RH will address a major evidence gap in our PA knowledge by adapting intervention strategies tested in urban and suburban areas to a micropolitan new destination community in a rural state."
"9193769","The past decade has witnessed numerous demonstrations that genomic data can be traced back to the corresponding named individuals. These attacks exploit various collections, including the NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), the 1000 Genomes Project, and the Beacon Project of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, and are often reported in the popular media. At the same time, research conducted in the first phase of this grant (from 2012-2016) showed that such re-identification attacks often represent worst- case, non-generalizable scenarios. Specifically, it was shown that these attacks often focus on the possibility of attack - and not its probability given the wide range of factors often at play in practice. By focusing on the possible, such investigations can lead policy makers to believe that de-identification is a useless activity. However, our research showed that de-identification is only one part of a larger strategy of deterrents that can be used to manage risk. By intelligently combining de-identification with other technical risk mitigation approaches (e.g., controlled access) and societal constructs (e.g., data use agreements and penalties), genomic data sharing solutions can be developed with appropriate levels of risk and utility for scientists and society. While our research laid the foundation for managing identification risk in genomic data sharing, significant questions remain regarding its translation into practical guidance. In particular, risk management models must be specialized to the type of data that is shared, the types of penalties (or punishments) available, and the costs of adopting and administering deterrence mechanisms. Thus, in the second phase of this research project, we propose to augment risk-based re-identification management frameworks to model and assess the deterrence approaches invoked by existing repositories, such as dbGaP (which holds a collection of smaller historical datasets from completed studies), as well as emerging initiatives, such as the Precision Medicine Initiative. This project will pursue three specific aims, designed to work in harmony, but at the same time sufficiently independent that if one fails, the research will still yield fruitful risk management guidance for genomic databases: 1) Develop game theoretic models to assess re-identification attacks at different levels of detail in genomic data sharing (e.g., aggregate summaries of the proportion of variants in case vs. control groups in association studies); 2) Characterize and measure the costs associated with common re-identification deterrence approaches for genomic data (e.g., physical investigatory reviews and virtual audits of IT system use); and 3) Optimize the parameterization of a deterrence policy (e.g., the amount of damages for violation of a data use agreement or the amount of time to withhold data from an attacker/investigator) given the expected value of genomic data. We will evaluate these approaches with a large repository of de-identified genomic and electronic medical records in use at a large academic medical center, datasets hosted at two federal repositories, and a web system that presents summary statistics from a cohort of 9000 participants."
"9143750","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many potentially effective e-health technologies fail to enjoy widespread adoption by older adults due to the dearth of accessible, user-friendly, delivery platforms. Multi-user health kiosks located in convenient community locations offer a way to bolster older adults' self-management capabilities and enhance communication with their PCPs, regardless of personal resources or distance from health services. This project entails investigation of older adults' perceptions of, motivations to use, and patterns of use of an adaptive, community-based, multi-user health kiosk. The overarching objective is to understand factors influencing older adults' use of the health kiosk as a measurement and intervention delivery system, relative to their identified needs for a healthier lifestyle and improved self-management of chronic disease. Kiosks capable of adaptive interaction with users will be deployed in nine congregate sites in southwestern Pennsylvania, enabling older adults to measure and track their own physical, physiological, and psychological data, communicate through secure messaging with primary care providers, and engage with e-health interventions designed to improve self-management, patient-provider communication, sleep, mobility and balance, physical activity and nutrition, bladder health, and mood. The specific aims of the project are to (1) describe the self-management needs, motivations, design preferences, and patterns of health kiosk use among diverse community-residing older adults in congregate settings; (2) determine factors that influence intensity of kiosk use among older adults with a range of needs for a healthier lifestyle and improved self-management of chronic disease; and (3) explore use of primary care, emergency room visits, and hospitalization during kiosk access. Over 18 months of study participation, older adults' interactions with the kiosk and the kiosk's adaptations to its users will be tracked. Frequent queries will explore motivations for using the kiosk and preferences for its interface design and content. Congruence will be evaluated between needs identified at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months and use of kiosk measures and modules throughout the study. Assessment of self-management confidence and capability and healthcare use will also occur at 6, 12, and 18 months. Factors influencing differences in intensity of kiosk use and differences in the change in healthcare use based on levels of intensity will be examined. In-depth interviews will be conducted with a subsample of ten individuals per site (n=90) purposively selected to represent high and low intensity kiosk users and those with high and low levels of need."

Yet their successes and paths of resilience largely have been ignored by public health and health research communities. The goal of this Exploratory Center of Excellence, namely The Center for American Indian Resilience (CAIR) is to reduce health disparities by identifying, assessing, applying and teaching models of resilience associated with positive health outcomes in American Indians (Als). This effort will build upon existing community-academic partnerships and expand the capacity and competence of Northern Arizona University (NAU), University of Arizona (UA) and Dine College (Navajo Nation Tribal College) independently and collectively to conduct resilience health sciences research that addresses health disparities. CAIR research activities will deepen our scientific knowledge of resilience and health. CAIR community engagement and training activities will translate this knowledge from research to practice to transform public health education, practice and policy.   Specific aims of CAIR are to: 1) Provide the administrative structure, coordination and resources for a transdisciplinary, multi-institutional team to collectively advance resilience research, education and application for the purpose of reducing health disparities specifically in Als; 2) Use a community-based participatory research approach (CBPR) to identify, assess, translate and apply models of resilience associated with positive health outcomes in Als; 3) Use a summer research enhancement program that provides intensive research coursework and field experiences, graduate research assistantships and seminars to guide and cultivate the exploration and application of resilience models among predominantly Al undergraduate and graduate students at NAU, UA and Dine College; and 4) Leverage existing and new tribal and institutional partnerships to establish an advisory board with expertise in community-based Al public health practice to build local capacity to integrate evidence-based models of resilience in 9-12 science education, health promotion practice and health policy."
"9255986","This Phase II project will develop a computer-based tool for the functional assessment of higher level instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) using simulated activities in a virtual environment (VE). IADLs are the high level activities such as managing finances and complex medication regimens and successfully negotiating novel or new situations that are necessary for fully independent living and which can be compromised by cognitive impairment in older individuals. The ability to conduct routine ADLs on a daily basis is the key element of successful aging. It is frequently the basis for determining whether an older individual is able to live independently and is a core criterion for the diagnosis of dementia. However, valid and reliable measurement of IADLs is difficult. Many existing scales were designed for use with patients with known cognitive impairment and focus on basic activities that are not sensitive to the decline in higher level behaviors that begins well before a dementia diagnosis is made. Most are based on an informant?s or the individual?s own rating of their abilities. Such an approach has the problem that, for a variety of reasons, individuals and informants may over- or under-rate the person?s skills. The range of possible scores is also often limited. Virtual reality using computer simulated environments is an obvious vehicle for the reliable assessment of a range of functional activities. The ultimate goal is to use virtual environment technology to develop a tool that will accurately measure performance across a range of high level functional tasks in older individuals with very mild dysfunction. The proposed tool, Functional Assessment using a Virtual Environment (FAVE), will offer five environments across a range of functional abilities. The FAVE tasks (Telephone Use, Medication Management, Finance Management, Household Activities and Transportation/Navigation) have been identified in the literature as activities that are both crucial for independent living and susceptible to subtle impairment. In Phase I, we used a task analysis approach to prepare scripts and storyboards for each task/scenario, submitted them to a focus group of experts for review, and implemented two tasks plus an introductory task as virtual environment scenarios. Tasks were piloted with normal older individuals and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Accuracy, response time, and eye-tracking data was collected and analyzed for differences between groups to determine the ability of FAVE to detect subtle difficulties in IADLs. Clear trends in speed and visual attention were identified. In Phase II, we will refine existing tasks, implement additional tasks, validate the tasks in an extensive study comparing FAVE results against actual performance in a large number of subjects, develop the most effective scoring metrics per task and overall, and perform usability/focus group testing to identify barriers to use and adoption. The resulting product will provide a tools to make functional assessment more feasible."
"9167283","Egan, Elizabeth S. Project summary/Abstract Severe malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum is a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes that causes immense morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Approximately 200 million people contract malaria each year, and there are ~500,000 deaths annually, primarily among children under the age of 5. The symptoms of severe malaria occur when P. falciparum enters the blood stage of its life cycle, where it invades and grows exponentially in erythrocytes. While antimalarial drugs are in widespread use, their efficacy is threatened by the rapid development of resistance among the parasites. As these drugs all target parasite factors, an alternative approach could be to target host factors that the parasite needs for survival. Although long- standing epidemiological data indicate that certain erythrocyte traits have been under natural selection due to malaria, it has historically been challenging to study mature erythrocytes at a molecular level as these unusual cells lack a genome and nucleus, making them genetically intractable. Here, we propose a proteome-wide forward genetic screen to identify host factors critical for malaria using enucleated erythrocytes derived from human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We recently reported a screen of human blood group genes using erythroblasts, which identified a new host factor for parasite invasion. We hypothesize that comprehensive screening in erythrocytes (the cell the parasite invades in vivo) will identify new classes of host determinants. We will use RNAi- and CRISPR-based genetic perturbations in HSCs and immortalized CD34+ cells to generate enucleated erythrocytes with gene depletion or disruption, and infect the cells with fluorescent P. falciparum. Using deep, quantitative RNA-sequencing, we will correlate shRNA/gRNA abundance with parasite survival and host cell enucleation, thereby generating a list of candidate host factors for P. falciparum as well as enucleation determinants. Candidates will be validated using complementary approaches including reverse genetics, live cell microscopy, in vitro parasite assays and hematological characterization. We will use the candidates to further investigate host-pathogen interactions using small molecules and parasite resistance selection. We anticipate that this project will lead to the discovery and characterization of critical host factors for P. falciparum, laying the foundation for the rational development of host-directed therapeutics for malaria.  "

"9352996","ABSTRACT: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and the risk for stroke increases with age. The mechanisms that contribute to post-ischemic injury and neurological dysfunction after stroke are not completely understood, and most clinical trials conducted to date for stroke therapeutics have failed. Failure to consider white matter (WM) injury is a critical gap in the development of successful stroke therapy. As mechanisms of WM injury differ from those in gray matter and change with age, an ideal stroke therapeutic must not only be directed towards neuronal and axonal protection across age, but also must restore function when applied after injury. One of our significant research achievements during the previous funding cycle established that Class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) activation contributes to excitotoxicity during ischemia and contributes to oxidative injury during the post-ischemic period by impairing mitochondrial structure and function. Class I HDAC inhibition promotes axon function recovery when applied before or after ischemia in young and aging WM through unknown mechanisms. Our current proposal focuses on the mechanisms of post-ischemic protection conferred by Class I HDAC inhibition in young and aging WM. Post-ischemic benefits of HDAC inhibition correlated with mitochondrial integrity, ATP production, and promotion of axon function recovery. While little is known about the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying this protective phenomenon, an intriguing reciprocal relationship has emerged between levels of HDACs and miRNAs affecting cellular survival following stroke. Among ischemia-regulated miRNAs, miR-331 is predicted to target Class I HDACs. Ischemia up-regulates Class I HDAC levels in young and aging WM. Our preliminary findings show that ischemia led to decreased levels of miR-331 concomitant with increased HDAC expression and that HDAC inhibition up-regulated miR-331 above control levels. Furthermore, WM ischemia activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS), leading to oxidative injury via mitochondrial dysfunction. In light of this information, we propose to further extend these studies by testing our novel hypothesis that Class I HDAC activation mediates WM ischemic injury by contributing to increased oxidative stress, impairing mitochondrial function, and down-regulating glial expression of miR-331. Our overall goal is to determine whether Class I HDACs act directly or recruit NOS or interact with miR-331 to exert post-ischemic injury to young and aging WM. Electrophysiological, biochemical, and mouse genetic approaches will be employed to test the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 is designed to investigate how the cellular origins of NOS isoform activation change with age and ischemia; Aim 2 is designed to determine whether Class I HDAC activation recruits NOS or directly mediates mitochondrial injury during ischemia; and Aim 3 is designed to establish whether Class I HDACs interact with miR-331 to mediate ischemic WM injury. Overall, the present project will unravel the role of Class I HDAC activity in WM ischemic injury to design novel therapies to minimize post-ischemic injury in patients."
"9226999","ABSTRACT Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common but untreatable condition identified over a half century ago. Affecting over half of the elderly in the United States, SVD leads to stroke and dementia and remains a significant public health concern. We study a genetic cause of SVD: CADASIL. CADASIL is the most common monogenic form of SVD and results from cysteine-altering mutations in the vascular smooth muscle protein NOTCH3. To understand mechanisms of SVD, mouse models of CADASIL have been generated with modest success. Though CADASIL models demonstrate accumulation of NOTCH3, they lack critical signs and pathological features of the disorder. For example, mutant NOTCH3 mice do not develop stroke or cognitive dysfunction, nor do they develop vascular smooth muscle loss and arterial thickening. The overall objective of this work is to gain insight regarding human CADASIL pathology that can be used to improve CADASIL mouse models. We hypothesize that a set of vascular proteins accumulate in CADASIL patients that are not expressed in mouse blood vessels. If true, then transgenic expression of these proteins has the potential to improve mouse models. Our experimental strategy includes: 1) screening the Human Protein Atlas for new brain vascular markers; 2) identifying human specific markers by comparative immunohistochemistry; 3) identification of new human specific markers that colocalize with conformationally altered NOTCH3 in human tissue; 4) experimental analysis of human-specific CADASIL proteins in cell culture for functions relevant to CADASIL. In preliminary work aimed to prove feasibility, we downloaded and analyzed over 150,000 images from the Human Protein Atlas in search of novel vascular markers. We then used immunohistochemistry to define two new human specific vascular proteins that co-localize with mutant NOTCH3 protein in CADASIL. Ultimately, this project will identify new proteins important in the genesis of CADASIL; it is likely that absence of these proteins in mice may explain the limited phenotypes of current preclinical SVD models."
"9224008","PROJECT SUMMARY  Our current understanding of the molecular etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is incomplete and likely the product of multiple interacting factors. The best-validated participant in the molecular pathology of PD is alpha-synuclein (?-syn). Mutations in, and multiplication of, the gene encoding ?-syn result in inherited forms of PD. In addition, the presence of ?-syn in Lewy bodies and neurites provides evidence for its association with idiopathic PD. A common hypothesis states that excess ?-syn and consequent aggregation causes neurotoxicity in a direct toxic gain-of-function event. Conversely, it has also been proposed that ?-syn aggregation may endanger neurons by removing the protein from its normal cellular location and diminishing its function in a toxic loss-of-function event. This issue remains a topic of debate. Despite this ambiguity, approaches that reduce ?-syn in the central nervous system represent an active area of research as a strategy for treating PD. Our published data in rats and nonhuman primates, and preliminary data in mice, supports the dissenting viewpoint, showing that eliminating ?-syn from mature dopamine (DA) neurons is not protective, but instead is toxic. Utilizing our newly developed conditional ?-syn knock-out mouse, our proposed studies will define the consequences that result from ablated/decreased expression of ?-syn in the nigrostriatal system. The use of rAAV to deliver CRE recombinase (iCRE) to dopamine neurons of adult mice carrying the floxed ?- syn allele will allow us to efficiently abolish ?-syn expression in mature neurons. This approach addresses the limitations of current germ-line mouse models by preventing the hypothesized compensatory adaptations that occur when ?-syn expression is abolished during development. The following proposal will utilize this new mouse model to: 1) Characterize the pattern, timing, and ?-syn dose-dependence of neurodegenerative effects on the nigrostriatal system and resultant impairment in motor behavior. 2) Define the characteristics of degeneration in its pattern and association with markers of cellular events previously implicated as participating in degeneration in PD (DA mishandling, oxidative/nitrative stress, proteasome/lysosome dysfunction, and microglial activation) at early and late stages of degeneration following removal of ?-syn. This proposal will answer the lingering question of whether ?-syn is crucial for the function and survival of mature DA neurons while also providing a new murine-based tool to study the importance of ?-syn induced DA neurodegeneration for the study of synucleinopathies. The successful completion of these aims will advance our knowledge and ability to develop therapeutic strategies aimed at halting neurodegeneration due to ?-syn dysfunction."
"9071969","SUMMARY ? PROJECT 2: PGC-1 SIGNALING AND MITOCHONDRIAL STRESS IN MELANOMA  During the process of melanoma formation, progression, and treatment, dramatic changes in metabolism occur  and are required for the evolving energetic and biosynthetic needs of rapidly proliferating cells. Mitochondria  serve as a central integration point for this metabolic re-programming; regulating ATP synthetic capacity, redox  signaling, and biosynthetic capability. Preliminary data presented in this P01 application demonstrate a  dynamic feedback circuit in specific melanoma subsets involving ATF4, MITF, and PGC-1? transcription  factors. The ATF4?MITF?PGC-1? axis is responsive to ER stress, nutrient deprivation, and melanoma driver  mutations, and regulates responses to targeted therapies, ROS stress, and metabolic stress. This Project is  focused on the role of the PGC-1 family of transcription coregulators, PGC-1?, PGC-1?, and PRC, in these  processes. Recent evidence indicates that PGC-1?, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and  function, is upregulated in a subset of melanomas together with MITF. Elevated PGC-1? expression correlates  with increased mitochondrial content and oxygen consumption rates. Interestingly, inhibition of BRAF in this  subset of melanomas results in further increase in mitochondrial content, oxygen consumption and induces  sensitivity to mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors. The interplay between the ER stress/unfolded protein  response and PGC-1?/mitochondria will be characterized in Project 1. Mitochondria and PGC-1? also integrate  signals related to glutamine metabolism, a focus of Project 3. We hypothesize that mitochondrial functional  capacity, as determined by the activity of PGC-1 factors, coordinates cellular stress responses and can  be used to define susceptibility to mitochondrial-targeted agents for clinical intervention. To  characterize the role of PGC-1?, PGC-1?, PRC and mitochondrial function in melanoma, we will (1) determine  the functional role of the MITF/PGC-1?/ERR? pathway in the metabolic regulation of melanoma formation and  treatment response and (2) evaluate the role of PGC-1? and PRC in melanoma metabolic regulation, stress  responses, and sensitivity to therapeutic intervention. Our studies will be closely integrated with Projects 1 and  3, and will require the use of Cores B and C."
"9169573","Project Summary One of the most remarkable aspects of biological systems is their ability to operate on many length and time scales to perform their functions. Thus, methods to study those functions need to cover, and preferably connect, such scales. When studying the architecture of cells and their molecular components, imaging modalities range from high-resolution X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM, where molecules are isolated from their context, to light microscopy and conventional EM, where the localization within the cell is precise, but the structural details are lost. Thus, the grand challenge is to bring together structural and cellular studies. Cryo-electron tomography (CET) holds great promise to bridge together current structural, biochemical, and biophysical approaches. CET allows us to obtain 3D reconstructions of pleiomorphic structures, such as organelles and cells at molecular resolution, providing snapshots of molecular landscapes inside cells captured in action. However, limitations in sample thickness had hindered the application of cryo- EM to eukaryotic samples. We use cryo-FIB milling to micromachine intact cryo-fixed cells into thin-enough regions to study with CET. The resulting data shows readily identifiable features of cells such as individual molecular complexes, proteins embedded in membranes, and filamentous networks, at unprecedented detail. Our data show that we can use this technology to observe the structure of macromolecular complexes deeply embedded and entangled inside the cell, e.g., in the nucleus. Under the right sampling conditions, we can derive the structural dynamics of these macromolecular complexes by statistically comparing individual molecules. Just like super-resolution light microscopy has extended the realm of questions than can be asked in cell biology, I believe that CET will have a transformative impact through its ability to look not only at the location and context, but also at the structure of molecules in their natural environment. The goal of this project is to unleash the full potential of CET by integrating new and available tools around CET, notably, we will: (1) extend the experimental set up to create devices that resemble experimental conditions better than EM grids in order to perturb samples under controlled conditions, (2) use these devices to correlate CET data with light microscopy and powerful tags used in conventional EM, and (3) create computational and modeling tools to analyze such data quantitatively and to integrate data from other sources to reveal the structural dynamics of these complexes and the molecular architectures they form in the cell. Putting in place these techniques will allow us to study structurally uncharted territory: the nuclear periphery. Our first target is the study of the organization of the networks that connect the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton formed by LINC complexes, nuclear lamina, and cytoskeletal filaments, in health and disease."
"9224578","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a highly prevalent, debilitating condition with a paucity of effective treatments. Usually starting in midlife, it persists into late years, with up to 50% of people over 65 reporting persistent pain. Patients futilely attempt numerous treatments, including risky surgeries to alleviate pain. Recent studies suggest that the central nervous system- i.e., aberrantly functioning brain circuits -plays a role in the origin and maintenance of chronic pain. However, the specific mechanisms underlying central chronic pain are not yet fully understood. The PI of this project formulated evidence-based Developmental Theory of predisposition to central chronic pain. Insights from translational neuroscience suggest that pain and feelings of interpersonal rejection or abandonment share neural circuits, neurotransmitters, genetic and immune markers, and that interpersonal emotion regulation between child and caregivers is crucial for the optimal development of this shared system. Early interpersonal adversity may lead to its aberrant development causing increased sensitivity to pain and interpersonal distress, and difficulty down-regulating and differentiating between them, thus creating a vicious cycle of pain and interpersonal suffering, predisposing to chronic pain in later years. In fact, early interpersonal adversity and adult heightened rejection sensitivity and loneliness are highly prevalent among chronic pain patients. To study the neural bases of these phenomena, the PI developed a novel brain imaging (fMRI) paradigm that measures the extent of modulation of pain by feelings of rejection. Her preliminary studies suggest that (a) feelings of interpersonal rejection modulate pain on a neural level among healthy people, (b) this neural modulation is associated early interpersonal adversity, and (c) non-optimal early interpersonal environment is associated with increased pain sensitivity in adulthood in an animal model. The proposed study will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying effects of early interpersonal adversity and mid-life interpersonal distress on central pain processing among patients with chronic pain. Low back pain is a highly common pain problem and 20-40% of back surgeries for pain result in chronic post-operative pain (CPOP). Using CPOP as a model to differentiate between central nervous system vs structural spine factors contributing to low back pain, pre-surgery brain imaging fMRI scans will be used to study predisposition to CPOP among patients with varying levels of early interpersonal adversity and current interpersonal distress. This will be the first study to (a) investigate the specific effects of early life and adult interpersonal adversity on neural circuits underlying pain and (b) use brain imaging to predict CPOP. This award will also measurably advance the training of PI in aging research methodology and translational social affective neuroscience, and will launch her translational research program which aims at identifying targets for reversing the drastic effects of interpersonal adversity on chronic pain and health, and for development of prevention programs for this problem of significant public health importance."

These science areas tend to be pursued as  single laboratory efforts. Thus, a major thrust of the CSB program is building collaborations and bridges  between CSB researchers and cancer biologists and clinicians. In addition to the traditional methods of  developing collaborations (e.g., topical retreats and symposia), the CSB leadership runs a very successful  molecular matchmaking service, bringing together synthetic chemists, structural biologists and biologists with  interesting small molecules. Notable successes of the matchmaking service include a new class of anti-nutrient  transporter compounds with exciting anti-cancer activities in vitro and in animal models.  Through its activities, the CFCCC directly contributes to the success of the anti-cancer research pursued by  CSB members. For example, neuronal nitric oxide synthase emerged as a target for melanoma, and  connections forged by the CFCCC led quickly to experiments with highly specific nNOS inhibitors. Similarly,  success in the area of analytical chemistry connecting biological recognition with electronics led to connections  with prostate and bladder cancer physicians to guide experiments leading to a clinical trial. The CFCCC also  provides pilot project funding, which help initiate studies between a synthetic chemist and biologist leading to  new types of anti-breast cancer compounds. The CSB leadership also helps to expand the research of its  members into cancer-related areas; for example, researchers with a promising new experimental technique for  mapping protein-protein interactions with proteomics MS were introduced to different potential collaborators  opening new doors and avenues of research.

The EAB reviews the Center, providing recommendations  concerning Programs, initiatives, and administrative operations. Multiple internal advisory committees exist,  namely the Executive Council (EC), which includes the Director, Deputy Director, Associate Directors, and  Chief of Cancer Services. This Council is the primary governance and decision-making body of the UACC and  is the epicenter of coordinating the planning and evaluation efforts of the UACC. It is responsible for the  development of the UACC's Strategic Plan and for facilitating its implementation as well as monitoring progress  towards goals. The EC evaluates the directions and effectiveness of existing Programs and makes  recommendations to the Director regarding resource utilization, reviews policies, and sets standards. It also  assists with all aspects of planning to meet the UACC's strategic goals. The EC draws direct input from other  internal advisory mechanisms: 1) the Scientific Leadership Council (SLC), which is comprised of the Program  Leaders and Shared Resource Directors, 2) the Clinical Research Organizational Council (CROC), 3) the  Cancer Education and Training Committee, 4) Shared Resource Management Committee, and 5) the  Administrative Team. An important aim for planning and evaluation activities is to articulate a vision for the  UACC and to define and implement a UACC-wide Strategic Plan for progress within the next five years that  prioritizes goals and identifies the resources needed to attain these goals. Critical to the success of obtaining  these goals is the existence of standing forums, at Center-wide retreats, at the Program level, and at the  Shared Resource level for UACC Members to present, hear, and discuss current work and future plans and to  establish strategic aims to obtain these goals. Working with patient advocates, community representatives, and  drawing on other expertise within the UA also helps to shape the approach to the goals of the UACC by  identifying specific needs within the Cancer Center's catchment area."
"9164137","Project Summary Ribosome assembly is an essential process in all domains of life. In eukaryotes, in excess of 200 non- ribosomal factors are involved in this poorly understood process. Defects in human ribosome assembly are associated with ribosomopathies, a set of diseases, which result in high incidences of cancer. Our understanding of eukaryotic ribosome assembly is currently limited by an inability to stop this process at particular stages. We have recently developed a new technique to study early events of eukaryotic ribosome assembly as a function of transcription. This technique can recapitulate and arrest early eukaryotic ribosome assembly intermediates, thereby facilitating the analysis of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis at an unprecedented level. In conjunction with other synergistic genetic, biochemical and structural biology methods, this technique will be used to elucidate hallmarks of early eukaryotic ribosome assembly, which previously represented intractable problems. Insights obtained from these studies will not only set new paradigms for eukaryotic ribosome assembly, but also have the potential to further our understanding of this process for the development of treatments."
"9182593","Project Summary/Abstract Depression is severely undertreated in Black men. Significant reasons for this include that traditional psychiatric treatments (i.e., psychotherapy and medication) are less acceptable to Black men, and that Black men report significant stigma regarding seeking these treatments. Depression also has major health consequences, including increased occurrence and worsening of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and even CVD mortality. We propose to address gaps in the literature and advance the field of minority men?s health by conducting the first randomized controlled trial testing the effects of strength training (i.e., weight lifting) on depression and cardiovascular health in a sample of depressed Black men. A total of 50 self-identifying Black men who meet a clinical level of depression will be randomized into a 12-week strength training (ST) program or a 12-week contact control. Both groups will meet on-site twice per week during the 12-week program, and follow-up assessments will occur at the end of the 12-weeks and at a 3-month follow-up. Blind to condition research staff will conduct assessments at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Qualitative interviews will be conducted immediately after the 3-month follow-up to gather input on participants? experiences and preferences. The primary outcome will be depression severity (measured by interview). Secondary outcomes will be inflammatory markers and CVD indicators (e.g., blood lipids, blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, body composition). The overall aim of this exploratory (R21) study is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of strength training as an intervention for depression in Black men. Specific aims are (1) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, retention, assessment, and intervention procedures among depressed Black men, (2) To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy in preparation for a future R01-supported randomized clinical trial, and (3) To explore potential mediators of the effect of ST on depression, including physiological (i.e., sleep quality) and psychological (i.e., self-esteem, acute changes in affect, enjoyment of exercise, physical self-concept) variables. The proposed research will lay the groundwork for a larger efficacy study of ST for Black men that will be fully powered to detect changes in both depression and CVD risk over long-term follow-up. Such a trial would be an initial step to combating major health disparities regarding CVD and treatment for depression among Black men."
"9185648","Project Summary  The cytoskeleton is essential to many aspects of life, cell division and motility being prime examples. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the roles of two actin nucleators, Spire (Spir) and Cappuccino (Capu). We are studying these protein in Drosophila, where they are known to be essential to polarity establishment during early development. Spir and Capu build an actin mesh that traverses the Drosophila oocyte throughout mid-oogenesis. The presence of the mesh and its removal at the correct developmental stage are both critical to polarity establishment. Thus learning how Spir and Capu collaborate to build the mesh is essential to a fundamental understanding of how they contribute to polarity establishment during development. In the proposed work, we will focus on two aspects of Spir-Capu operation: 1) the mechanism by which they assemble actin filaments and 2) how Spir and Capu are spatially and temporally regulated, in order to establish the actin mesh and then remove it when appropriate. We have developed a working model in which Spir and Capu are both active throughout mid-oogenesis (stages 5-9); Spir enhances nucleation by Capu, specifically at membranes; together they build a dynamic actin mesh until stage 10 when Spir and Capu protein levels drop, the mesh disappears, and streaming begins. We will test this model using both in vitro and in vivo approaches with assays that span scales from single molecule fluorescence microscopy to whole animal genetics. Testing this model will lead to a mechanistic understanding of two proteins, conserved throughout metazoan species. It will advance our knowledge of the cytoskeleton and how it is controlled. Given the co-existence of this pair of proteins in polar cells, including neurons and epithelial cells in mammals, it has been proposed that their role as polarity factors in Drosophila is conserved. Thus we anticipate that what is learned about Spir and Capu in Drosophila oogenesis will be applicable to our understanding of the cytoskeleton, cell polarity, fertility, development and health in many animals, ranging from Drosophila to humans."
"9240313","The 35-site, international FOR-DMD study (Finding the Optimum Corticosteroid (CS) Regimen for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) has recruited 77% (1 additional subject randomized 3/1/16--too late to include in total) of the planned 225 boys. Obtaining study drugs and recruiting for this rare disease took longer than originally anticipated so this application requests that the originally awarded funds be provided for an additional four years. The goals of FOR-DMD are to determine which of the three most commonly prescribed regimens of CS (0.75 mg/kg/d prednisone; 0.9 mg/kg/d deflazacort; 0.75 mg prednisone for 10 days, then off for 10 days) has the best risk/benefit for DMD over a three year period. All boys receive standardized treatment of complications of DMD and prevention of CS side effects. The treatment of DMD is rapidly changing with multiple clinical trials of gene modification and other strategies underway or planned. All new treatments also include CS. Standardizing CS treatment is essential for interpretation of the benefit of new treatment and for long-term combination treatment. This renewal application addresses the original hypotheses that: (1) daily CS are preferable to an intermittent regiment of CS; and (2) that deflazacort is preferable to prednisone in terms of CS toxicity. This large cohort of rigorously evaluated and followed boys also provides opportunity to test the hypothesis that specific genetic (e.g. SPP1 and LTB4) or proteomic markers will identify factors that determine disease severity and complications and predict CS benefit and toxicity. This hypothesis will be tested with other funds, already obtained which have supported a repository of serum and DNA from all boys. This rigorously-standardized subset of boys with DMD followed according to clearly defined care standards will address the uncertainties regarding CS regimen and side effect prevention that have delayed universal acceptance of CS treatment for DMD with its tragic consequence of early disability and death before age 20 vs survival with corticosteroids into the 3rd and 4th decades."
"9136713","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Rationale: Development of dynamic hyperinflation is a primary limiting factor of exercise tolerance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To lessen the development of dynamic hyperinflation, and to improve exercise tolerance in COPD patients, we have developed a breathing- retraining technique to be used during pulmonary rehabilitation. This breathing-retraining technique is designed to decrease respiratory rate and prolong exhalation. We demonstrated that, in the short- term, hyperinflation and exercise duration improved more with breathing-retraining plus exercise- training than with exercise-training alone. Because a crucial aspect of pulmonary rehabilitation is the maintenance its short-term benefits over the long-term, we now propose to test whether short- term benefits of breathing-retraining plus exercise followed by an adherence-intervention program are sustainable over the long-term Primary Hypothesis: (H1) In COPD patients, improvements in exercise duration on a constant- load treadmill test will be greater after 12 weeks of breathing- retraining plus exercise-training followed by a 42-week adherence-intervention program (1 yr. total) than after 12 weeks of exercise-training alone followed by a 42-week adherence-intervention program (1 yr. total). Secondary Hypotheses: One year after randomization, exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation will be less during a constant-load treadmill test (H2), 6-minute walking distance will be longer (H3), and mastery over breathing will be greater (H4) in the breathing- retraining plus exercise-training group than in the exercise-alone group. Lastly (exploratory objective), we will assess the effect of the patient's physiologic, psychologic and clinical phenotype on short-term and long-term responsiveness to pulmonary rehabilitation. Methods: The proposed study is a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which 250 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD will be enrolled. One hundred forty of these patients are expected to qualify for randomization into the breathing-retraining plus exercise-training group or the exercise-training alone group. Patients will receive 12-weeks of supervised training according to group assignment (three times weekly) followed by an adherence-intervention program (weekly phone motivational interviews, home-exercise program, and monthly laboratory booster sessions). Follow-up testing will be completed at 12 weeks, and at 6 and 12 months. Testing will include pulmonary function test, incremental-load and constant-load treadmill tests, 6-minute walk test, measurements of dyspnea, assessment of respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength and endurance and quadriceps ultrasonography. Analysis: In the principal analysis of the primary outcome measure (exercise duration; H1) we will compare changes in exercise duration (constant work-rate treadmill test) from baseline to end of study using 2-sample t-test (two-tailed ?=.05). The primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principles. Multiple imputation will be used for study subjects missing the 12-month measurement. This imputation model will be based on baseline characteristics of study participants. Several secondary analyses of the primary outcome measure will be performed (H2-H4). Linear regression will be used to determine whether the observed treatment benefits persist after adjustment for baseline covariates and measures of adherence to treatment. Since several measurements will be taken on each patient, mixed-models analysis will be used to compare the changes on the constant- load treadmill test over time between the two groups."
"9192895","PROPOSAL SUMMARY Discovery of endogenous stem cells found within the heart, cardiac progenitor cells (CPC), has prompted intense basic discovery in multiple experimental animal models and clinical trials in heart failure patients. A survey of the literature reveals that the most popular experimental animal models exhibiting regenerative properties are also characterized by genome duplication or polyploidy. Our lab has recently discovered a fundamental difference between human and rodent CPCs: rodent CPCs possess polyploid mononuclear tetraploid (4n) chromatin content, whereas human CPCs are mononuclear diploid (2n) cells. This fundamental biological distinction between humans and rodents prompts provocative questions regarding regenerative potential differences between humans versus other species as well as the translational applicability of regenerative studies performed in rodent models. If ploidy is an integral aspect of tissue regeneration in lower vertebrates and other species, then elucidating the biological basis of CPC ploidy and mechanistic differences in cell signaling and mitosis between polyploid rodent CPCs versus diploid human CPCs will provide important insight for enhancement of regenerative potential. The overall hypothesis is that mononuclear chromatin duplication in CPCs improves regenerative capacity of the heart. The short-term goal is to establish biological distinctions and elucidate unique molecular properties of polyploidy CPCs relative to diploid human CPCs. The significance is to understand the advantages of polyploidy for regeneration while also uncovering previously unrecognized limitations of extrapolating from experimental animal model studies to clinical interventional approaches. Two specific aims are proposed based upon the following hypotheses: (1) Ploidy status of CPCs is species, tissue, and age-specific in small (e.g. mouse, rat) versus large (e.g. pig, dog, cat) experimental animal models as well as humans, and (2) Reduction in murine CPCs from tetraploid to diploid genomic content occurs in response to alterations in environment leading to change in gene transcription and mitotic chromosomal alignment. The novelty and impact is to define novel biological attributes of a well known and heavily studied cardiac stem cell and to apply that novel understanding to appreciate the molecular and cellular basis of regenerative responses in both human and non-human myocardial responses to pathologic injury. The long-term goal is to apply the knowledge gained from understanding the role of polyploidy in regeneration to improve upon regenerative therapies in the treatment of heart failure."
"9271721","Gene Transfer and NMR Studies in Alpha-Mannosidosis Brain. We will investigate the ability of systemic delivery of a novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector to treat the central nervous system (CNS) disease in a cat model of the human lysosomal storage disease (LSD) alpha-mannosidosis (AMD). In most LSDs genetic correction of a relatively small number of mutant cells results in secretion of the normal enzyme and receptor-mediated uptake by surrounding cells, resulting in metabolic correction of the non- transduced cells. The major problem for treating the brain is that pathology is present throughout the CNS because the metabolic defect is present in all cells. Thus, treating the whole brain requires global distribution of the therapeutic normal alpha-mannosidase (MANB) enzyme. This problem is exacerbated by the enormous size difference between mouse and human brains (~3,000 fold). The domestic cat brain is an excellent intermediate in size as it is ~100 times larger than a mouse brain, while the human brain between birth and 1 year (when treatment is expected to be the most effective) is only 10-30 times larger than the cat brain. The cat brain also has a gyrencephalic cerebral cortex that is structurally much more similar to the human brain than the rodent's. Thus, the underlying premise of this translational project is that strategies developed to globally correct the AMD cat brain are more likely to translate effectively into clinical trials. We have shown in this project that AAV gene transfer into the AMD cat brain either by multiple intraparenchymal injections or by infusion into the CSF can improve clinical and histological parameters, but the correction is incomplete. Certain AAVs can enter the CNS after systemic intravascular delivery in mice and mediate widespread transduction, but in large animal brains vector distribution is much more limited. We have developed a novel AAV vector for systemic delivery that transduces neurons throughout the cerebral cortex and other regions of both cat and monkey brains. The new vector also has the novel property of efficiently delivering the gene into large brains with a single-stranded AAV vector genome, whereas previous large animal intravascular AAV delivery experiments have used self-complementary (sc)-AAVs, which are too small to accommodate the MANB cDNA (~3kb). The novel vector will be compared to other AAVs to determine if complimentary patterns of transduction occur in the CNS and other organs to improve the therapeutic effect. We also have developed MR-based imaging assays to non-invasively measure brain pathology and preliminary experiments show they can quantitatively monitor the response to AAV treatment. The specific aims are directed towards optimizing delivery, minimizing dose, evaluating clinical and lifespan improvements, and assessing the accuracy of non- invasive imaging parameters by correlation with histopathology. Although significant progress has been made on this project to date, the treatment is still incomplete and further improvements are needed to ensure the most effective translation into a clinical protocol for human patients."

"9349627","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human longevity steadily increased over the past century. There is great uncertainty, however, regarding the extent to which this was accompanied by the compression of morbidity. Given current dramatic increases in health care costs, especially costs during the last 6 months of life, this question is of profound importance t society. The National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) is a Medicare-based sample of the U.S. population aged 65+ initiated in 1982 with longitudinal follow-up in 1984, 1989, 1994, 1999, and 2004, with complete linkage to Medicare claims and vital statistics data for 1982-2009, and for eligible participants to Medicaid files (i.e., the 2004-2007 MAX files), supplemented with the 1999-2009 MDS and OASIS files. The 1982-1994 NLTCS produced the first reported major improvements of functional health as assessed by Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scores within the NLTCS population. The 1999 NLTCS substantially expanded its scope by selecting 1,877 participants and 869 siblings for supplemental data collection in 2000- 2002, yielding 639 blood (participants only) and 2,078 buccal swab (participants and siblings) samples for genetic studies. Moreover, of the 1,808 NLTCS participants contributing to the biospecimen sample, 1,345 were alive at the 2004 NLTCS and 1,183 were re-assessed. A total of 1,031 participants were age 85+ initially (429) or attained age 85 during the 2000-2010 follow-up period (602), with a total of 717 still alive as of the cutof date in 2010. The biospecimen sample currently provides 13,303 person-years of follow-up data, with 5,098 person-years above age 85. We propose to utilize this unique population-based sample, its associated functional data, linked Medicare/Medicaid claims data, and DNA samples, to quantitate variable degrees of the compression of morbidity and to test the hypothesis that constitutional genetic factors contribute to the modulation of these differential ratios of healthspans/lifespans. We will first address the connections between longevity, co-morbidity, functional health (ADL/IADL), and declines of physiological and cognitive functions (Aim 1). We will then conduct SNP array analysis of 639 blood and 2,078 buccal swab samples to obtain and assess a wide range of genetic information (Aim 2). We will assess associations of phenotypes of long healthy life with candidate polymorphisms within two highly relevant coupled gene networks-Insulin/IGF1 signaling (incl. FOXO3A and IGFR) and mTOR pathways-linked to aging and longevity across different species (Aim 3). Then, given published associations of genome-wide heterozygosity with cardiovascular health (Campbell et al., 2007), we will seek such associations with degrees of morbidity compression (Aim 4). Also, given the scientific value of the project data, we will release additional years of de-identified CMS data (Aim 5) and de- identified versions of the genotypic/phenotypic data derived from our SNP array analysis (Aim 6), using CMS, NIA, and Duke IRB approved protocols. We will replicate/validate our results using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), employing comparable phenotypic and genotypic measures and linked CMS data."
"9202052","Delirium, an acute disorder of attention and cognition, is a common, life-threatening, and potentially preventable clinical syndrome in older persons. Given its adverse impact on functioning and quality of life, delirium holds tremendous healthcare and societal implications for the individual, family, community, and healthcare systems. Despite its importance, fundamental advances in diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment have been lagging and there is a compelling need for more effective approaches to advance the field. Responding to RFA-AG-16-009, we propose the development of a collaborative research network, NIDUS (Network for Investigation of Delirium across the U.S.), to advance scientific discovery through a purposeful, coordinated effort. Our specific aims are: (1) To create and maintain a database that will catalog elements and provide an efficient platform to enhance the sharing of data and biospecimens both within and outside the proposed network, facilitating multi-site collaboration, secondary analyses, and pilot studies to catalyze the field; (2) To develop a repository of core measures for delirium identification, diagnosis, and severity, and to harmonize data across all types of delirium studies; (3) To support pilot studies to encourage innovative research, targeted to priority areas (risk factors/prognosis; pathophysiology/biomarkers; diagnostic tools/phenomenology; and clinical interventions); (4) To mentor junior investigators interested in delirium research through training programs, educational resources, and integration into network activities; (5) To disseminate information on research resources, data sharing, training opportunities, and potential collaborations in a timely and effective manner to relevant stakeholders and to the broader scientific community. These synergistic aims will leverage the accumulated research expertise of over 28 delirium leaders (12 coinvestigators/Steering Committee and 16 Scientific Advisory Board members) across 27 institutions (who have committed in-kind support), to create the NIDUS collaborative network. NIDUS will provide a research infrastructure with 2 Resource Cores to provide: (1) a catalog of research resources/ databases and (2) a repository of core delirium measures. These will be augmented with 3 Task Forces providing: (1) pilot grants, (2) mentorship and career development support, and (3) dissemination of information through many approaches (e.g., scientific symposia, annual meetings, and social media). NIDUS will create a unique national resource that will facilitate and catalyze innovation in delirium research through providing core resources and training, targeting priority areas, promoting collaboration across disciplines and institutions, engaging and mentoring junior investigators across fields, and disseminating research findings broadly and effectively. Bringing together diverse multidisciplinary perspectives, including patient/family perspectives, holds great potential to shift research paradigms and enhance innovation. Through targeting delirium, the ultimate goal of the network is to improve healthcare and quality of life for all older persons."
"9253871","Lysosomal diseases represent a group of more than 50 disorders caused by inherited defects in a wide spectrum of proteins. These disorders affect many organ systems, most notably brain, leading to chronic illness and death of affected individuals. Work groups focused on these disorders play a crucial role in stimulating discussion and interactions among experts in the field in order to improve knowledge about the pathophysiology of lysosomal storage diseases to identify novel targets and develop innovative treatment approaches. The Lysosomal Disease GRC has played a crucial role in stimulating this field. Held alternatively at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas, and at the Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco in Lucca (Barga), Italy, we are one of the newest of over 170 annual conferences organized by the GRC, an organization known world-wide for its high-quality, cutting-edge academic conferences. The 2017 Lysosomal Disease GRC will again offer a critical venue for addressing major topics in lysosomal biology, disease mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy, including (i) lysosomal positioning and movement, which is emerging as a critical determinant of many lysosomal functions; (ii) lysosomal membrane proteins that contribute to cell dysfunction across many disorders and pathogenic cascades; (iii) mechanisms of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs); (iv) lysosomal dysfunction in diseases other than LSDs; (v) new, innovative therapies for correction of lysosomal disease; (vi) diagnostics ad biomarkers for LSDs; and (vii) ongoing and upcoming clinical trials focused on lysosomal disease. As conceived, this conference is unique in the academic calendar and an outstanding complement to other existing lysosomal disease forums in USA and Europe. To address these important topics we have invited, as speakers and discussants, 40 leading and internationally known scientists and clinicians working in the field of lysosomal disease. Each has accepted our invitation and will join what we anticipate to be an additional 160 attendees, fully one-third of whom we anticipate will be junior investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students who are at the early stages of their careers. Our 2017 meeting has again been selected to host a GRS, a special meeting organized and run by graduate students and early postdoctoral fellows. The presence of the GRS insures that the very best and the brightest of the next generation of lysosomal disease researchers will be part of the GRC as well. The discussion and cross fertilization of ideas and approaches occurring as part of the GRC and GRS meetings we believe will accelerate not only our understanding of the role of the lysosomal system in health and in disease, but also move us closer to effective therapies for many of these disorders."
"9142058","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hunger selectively enhances attention to food-associated cues, which can lead to excessive eating and obesity. Our lab seeks to establish a genetic mouse model to examine the neural pathways underlying hunger- dependent attention to food-cues. Our proposed circuit includes neurons expressing agouti-related protein (AgRP) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (sensing internal state), the amygdala (updating the value of sensory cues and encoding motivational salience), and the higher visual cortical areas that receive selective amygdalar input (object recognition). Our proposed model for hunger-dependent attention is that hypothalamic AgRP neuron activity mirrors a drive to seek food. The amygdala integrates these interoceptive cues with exteroceptive cues about the sensory environment (via inputs from higher visual cortical areas) to identify motivationally relevant cues  in the environment and allocate additional sensory processing to these cues. I hypothesize that as the hunger state of the animal changes, so does the motivational relevance or `value' of food-cues, a process dependent on activity in both the hypothalamus and the amygdala. In support of this, in a large number of human neuroimaging studies, the amygdala and ventral visual cortical areas that receive amygdalar input consistently show increased responses to visual food cues during hungry, but not sated, states, an effect likely due to indirect hypothalamic (and possibly direct hormonal) influences on these areas. These studies, however, lack the cellular resolution to dissect the basic microcircuits involved in hunger- dependent attention. Unlike in human neuroimaging studies, our studies in behaving mice involve the simultaneous recording, at single cell resolution, of genetically-identified neurons, across natural and induced states of hunger. I will examine two nodes in our proposed circuit. In Aim 1, I will use electrophysiological recordings in optogenetically-defined classes of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to measure state-dependent neural responses to food-associated and neutral visual cues. In Aim 2, I will use two-photon calcium imaging to measure the state-dependent neural responses of amygdala axons projecting to higher visual cortex in an identical task. Our preliminary data suggests that, both AgRP cells and the amygdalar projections to higher visual cortex show hunger-dependent neural biases to food-cues. Finally, I will determine the contribution of hypothalamic pathways in hunger-dependent attention to food-cues by testing whether optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons, a manipulation known to drive food-seeking behavior, is sufficient to recapitulate neuronal biases to food-cues (Aim 3). In  this way, I can begin to define the relationship between circuits underlying the drive to seek food, and those translating this drive into selective cognitive processing of specific sensory cues. In summary, my proposal will dissect the neural pathways from hypothalamus to cortex important for hunger-dependent attention to food cues, and provide an important step towards the rational design of novel therapies for reducing over-attention and addiction to highly palatable foods."
"9145620","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth violence is a serious public health issue, particularly in the disproportionate burden upon economically disadvantaged, inner city, and minority populations. Intentional injury is the leading cause of death among persons 10 to 24 years of age in Kentucky, and the second leading cause of death for this age group nationally. Alarmingly, Kentucky's homicide rate for this same age group is 10 times higher for Black males (38.7/100,000) than for White males (3.9/100,000). In Louisville, KY, substantial social and health disparities-including violence and related risk factors-are concentrated in West Louisville (WL), an economically disadvantaged, urban, primarily Black community. Led by the School of Public Health & Information Sciences (SPHIS), researchers at the University of Louisville (UofL) propose to establish the UofL Youth Violence Prevention Center, partnering with researchers from Vanderbilt University. The specific aims of the proposed center include: 1. Strengthen the infrastructure to support youth violence prevention research and practice at the University of Louisville. 2. Develop, implement and evaluate a community-level social norming campaign to change the norms of violence among youth in West Louisville using mass and social media. 3. Document the development and implementation of the social norming campaign to improve replication and scalability in other settings or communities. 4. Evaluate the relationship between community readiness, community capacity, and the implementation of the community-level social norming campaign. 5. Disseminate study findings in meaningful and actionable format to a variety of relevant audiences (i.e., community, local organizations and leaders, youth violence prevention researchers and practitioners, academic peers, and policy-makers). The interdisciplinary research team proposes a quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of using a community-level 3-year social norming campaign utilizing new media to change norms of violence among youth 10-24 and introduce prosocial norms driven by cultural identity, with WL as the intervention community and East Nashville, TN as the control community. The researchers and a team of community collaborators will with a professional advertising agency to plan and design the campaign, which will be deployed in Year 2. Surveys and interviews will capture data measuring our dependent variables of social norms and violent behavior (independent variables: campaign exposure by media type, demographics), and population-level youth violence data from schools, emergency departments, and local police departments will offer measures of change in serious youth violence at the population level."
"9123437","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant is the gold standard therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure, with more than 5,000 transplants performed worldwide annually. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) represents the most common cause of early mortality after cardiac transplantation, accounting for up to 40% of deaths occurring in the first thirty postoperative days. It represents a significant barrier to expansion of cardiac transplantation as definitive therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Despite its clinical impact, significnt gaps remain in our understanding of PGD. Factors related to the donor, the transplant procedure itself, and systemic recipient factors potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of PGD. However, PGD is not adequately predicted by donor factors, pre-transplant organ function, or compatibility. Importantly, cardiac allografts objectively considered to be of margina status by these metrics do not demonstrate an increased rate of PGD. Emerging evidence suggests a fundamental role for mitochondrial dysfunction in PGD, specifically as a result of oxidative stress. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial injury likely further stimulates pro-inflammatory signaling, thus contributing to dysfunction in aggregate with an augmented alloimmune response.  Our central hypothesis is that mitochondrial injury and subsequent immune consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction are critical in development of the PGD phenotype. The proposed studies will investigate the fundamental injury processes underlying PGD following cardiac transplantation and subsequent immune consequences that may contribute to graft dysfunction. The goal of these studies is to interrogate the fundamental injury processes and subsequent immune consequences that contribute to graft dysfunction. These studies will inform the design of new strategies to facilitate improved prediction, prevention, and management of PGD."
"9326635","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term objective of this application is to bring a trachea patch to the market to treat tracheal stenosis, or narrowing of the airway, which left untreated is a life-threatening condition that affects both young children and adults. Currently, otolaryngologists have only two major options for treating tracheal stenosis. One is a complex surgical procedure known as slide tracheoplasty that few surgeons in the country are truly qualified to perform. The other is to open the trachea wider and hold it open with a graft of rib cartilage. Both are difficult, time- consuming procedures with potential complications.  We have a U.S. patent application submitted on a trachea patch biomaterial that overcomes the four major technical hurdles required to replace rib cartilage grafting: 1) mechanical integrity, 2) suturable, 3) resorbable, and 4) air-tight. There is currently nothing on the market even remotely resembling the idea of a synthetic patch for tracheal stenosis. While the academic tissue engineering community has focused primarily on regenerating an entire trachea with highly complex strategies, arguably leading to technology in search of an application, we have focused instead on identifying a specific patient indication with an unmet need and designed a technology to fill that void.  Co-investigators Weatherly and Detamore have worked together for nearly a decade, and after preliminary studies in 38 rabbits and partnering with Nanofiber Solutions in 2012, together as a team we are at an inflection point where a large animal study is necessary to translate the technology to the clinic. Therefore, the current Phase I SBIR project is highly focused with a single Specific Aim: To demonstrate proof of concept (safety) with engineered trachea patches to repair induced defects in sheep tracheas. We will test the hypothesis that covering induced trachea defects with our engineered trachea patches will allow sheep to survive with minimal tracheal stenosis. Completion of the Phase I project will strategically position us to incorporate FDA guidance and embark on a full-scale efficacy study in sheep in a Phase II SBIR that will allow us to proceed to the clinic.  Compared to rib cartilage  grafting, our trachea patch holds the following advantages: 1) No surgery to remove rib tissue, saving operating room time and cost, and eliminating potential complication/infection and morbidity at the rib site (attractive to patients and insurance companies), 2) Easy to use, as it i plug and play for surgeons who perform rib cartilage grafting (attractive to surgeons), 3) No biologics or drugs are required (attractive to investors for FDA approval). For several reasons, we focus initial clinical translation on the pediatric population with laryngotracheal stenosis. In  the simplest terms, our goal is to fix tracheas for kids around the world with narrowed airways to help them survive and breathe normally again."
"9089033","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focus on the cellular properties of neurons of Barrington's nucleus (BRN) and their responses to afferent or pharmacological stimulation. BRN neurons are positioned to coordinate micturition with arousal and voiding behaviors as they innervate the preganglionic neurons that regulate detrusor contraction as well as the locus coeruleus (LC), the major brain norepinephrine nucleus. Dysfunctions in this circuit may also underlie bladder and voiding disorders, particularly Underactive Bladder (UAB). We will take advantage of technical advances combining genetics, optical stimulation and imaging to elucidate how this nucleus functions and how it can be manipulated to treat disorders such as UAB. As the majority of BRN neurons express the stress related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), they can be easily identified and studied in brain slices from mice with CRF-Cre dependent expression of fluorescence reporter proteins. The close proximity of the LC and BRN in these slices we will allow us to directly quantify the relationship between BRN and LC neurons and to better understand this central branch of the micturition reflex. In aim one we will characterize with patch clamp recordings the cellular properties of neurons in the BRN-LC circuit and how they change with aging. This will be paired with immunocytochemical (IHC) determination of neurotransmitter phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of BRN neurons co-localize CRF and glutamate. Then we will use CRF- Channelrhodopsin 2 mice to control CRF expressing BRN neurons with different frequencies of optical stimulation and quantify their synaptic action in the LC. In aim two using CRF-GCaMP6f mice that express a Ca2+ indicator in CRF neurons we will be able to investigate the functional BRN circuitry as it modifies with age and thus identify cellular changes in the pontine micturition center that may be causal to age-related UAB. Our exploratory proposal will provide us with the conceptual framework and essential preliminary data to develop a mechanistic knowledge of the functional and pharmacological regulation of the BRN circuitry relevant for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of UAB. The goal of the application is to set the stage for a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to the understanding of the role of the pontine micturition center in UAB."
"9356785","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal, responsive to RFA-MD-15-001 'System-Level Health Services and Policy Research on Health Disparities (R01)', is to examine whether recent policy changes that aim to improve utilization and quality of behavioral health care in the general population have had a positive impact on race/ethnic disparities in care. Although efficacious treatments for psychiatric disorders have become widely available, the allocation of treatment across the population remains inequitable. Race and ethnic disparities in mental health care, defined by a landmark Institute of Medicine report as differences in receipt of care not attributable to either health status or treatment preferences, have consistently been found both in utilization and quality of behavioral health care. Disparities in treatment of psychiatric and substance use disorders across race/ethnic minority populations are particularly concerning because of the adverse impact that these disorders have across the adult life course, including effects on exposure to violence, family formation, educational attainment, employment, income and mortality. Barriers to treatment faced by members of race/ethnic minority populations can compound pre-existing social disadvantages and contribute to the persistence of broader social inequalities.  This project examines four recent state and federal policy initiatives: 1) the requirement that young adults be eligible to remain on their parent or guardian's health insurance policy through age 26, 2) the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to those with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Line, 3) expansion of managed care, and 4) mental health parity. While each of these policies has beneficial impacts at a population level, their impacts on disparities in care have not been examined. This is a critical gap in our knowledge because programs that improve utilization and quality of care in the general population can have neutral or even negative impacts on disparities. State-level variation in each of these policies, in some cases pre-dating federal legislation, provides an opportunity to assess their impact on disparities empirically. This project will first use the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, the nation's largest behavioral health surveillance survey to assess the impact of each of these policies and variation in policy impacts across geographic areas. We will then examine a set of complementary outcomes using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which has a smaller sample size but additional detail on costs and quality of care, which are important for understanding equity in the behavioral health services. Empirical evaluation of the impacts of major recent health policy initiatives is needed to guide future policy strategies towards more effective reduction of disparities in behavioral health care and reducing the disproportionate burden of mental and substance use disorders on race and ethnic minorities in the US."
"9175521","ABSTRACT: A cochlear-implant (CI) restores high levels of speech understanding to individuals across the lifespan. However, a gap in knowledge exists because we do not understand how aging affects hearing in CI users. Aging is associated with changes at multiple levels of the brain, thereby making it difficult to determine if the poorer auditory performance that occurs with advancing age is a result of changes in the auditory periph- ery, central auditory neural structures, cognition, or a combination of the three mechanisms. Since a CI by- passes the cochlea, we propose an innovative approach for investigating aging and hearing by using a human CI model. Using age (younger vs older adults) and group (CI vs normal hearing, NH) comparisons will allow us to determine the age-related contributions of cochlear and central factors to hearing. The long-term goals of this project are to (1) determine how to maximally remediate age-related auditory and cognitive processing def- icits with a CI and (2) better understand the biological effects of auditory aging. The objective of this grant is to establish age as an observable and significant factor for auditory temporal processing in CI users. Our central hypothesis is that advancing age significantly degrades central temporal processing and speech understanding abilities in CI users, which is independent of the age-related peripheral hearing loss that occurs in acoustically- hearing subjects. The rationale for the proposed research is that there is a rapidly increasing number of older adults that elect to receive a CI, but there is essentially no research on this specific population that fully utilizes the available array of research tools to study hearing in this population; our field arguably has minimal direct evidence and understanding of age-related changes to auditory processing of electrical stimulation. With strong preliminary data in hand, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) De- termine the extent to which temporal processing abilities decrease with age using highly-controlled and simple (non-speech) stimuli in CI subjects; (2) Determine the extent to which age-related temporal processing factors affect speech understanding in CI subjects; and (3) Determine the extent to which aging affects cortical tem- poral encoding of speech in CI subjects. This approach is innovative because: (1) the topic of aging in older CI users is an under-studied area and (2) by using a CI model, we will better understand the biological factors un- derlying how aging affects hearing. Our outcomes will provide a significant positive impact on hearing and un- derstanding speech with a CI, which will increase CI users' quality of life."
"9283934","ABSTRACT Sexual Violence (SV) and Teen Dating Violence (TDV) are significant public health concerns in the United States. Within Michigan, 5,500 sexual assaults were reported, more that 20% of which occur in Wayne County. More than 100,000 domestic violence offenses were reported to police in Michigan in 2009, however factors including gender, race, and socio-economic status influence decisions to contact legal systems. Understanding modifiable protective factors that may be efficacious in prevention is essential, including social norms and social connectedness, and how these may be leveraged in a context-specific approach to prevent IPV and SV. The aim of the research is to adapt, implement and evaluate an empirically-based developmentally appropriate, primary prevention strategy for SV and TDV perpetration, focused on influencing community-level change through youth empowerment and positive youth development to build social connectedness, improve bystander intervention, and improve social norms. The role of technology in TDV and SV, as well as a gender sensitive lens regarding the similarities and difference in the mechanism, meaning and context of violence will be examined. The central hypothesis is that a student-driven primary prevention strategy, focusing on social norms and school and community connectedness, implemented in middle school settings will be effective in reducing the incidence of SV and TDV. Using a group randomized trial, the proposed study seeks to disentangle relationships between SV and IPV perpetration, youth empowerment, social connectedness, and social norms. The intervention and research will be conducted in collaboration with six high schools in Wayne County, Michigan, including focus groups, process observation, and biannual survey research. The intervention will be infused within the school curriculum as an elective for ninth and tenth grades students. Students who provide youth assent and parental consent will be surveyed six times over three years, starting with the ninth and tenth grades. Youth and parents will be recruited to participate in focus groups to inform the adaptation of the intervention strategy and provide greater understanding of the survey research. Extensive measures will be taken to preserve the confidentiality of research participants. At the end of each year, data sharing and assistance with interpretation will take place in a collaboration between the research team and intervention schools to strengthen infrastructure. Intervention and comparison schools will also be provided training and capacity building at the end of the project to promote sustainability. Analysis will be conducted using hierarchical linear modeling and structural equation modeling. A nested model structure that analyzes the hierarchical nature of the study variables will be used to estimate the effects of individual, relational, school, and community-level risk and protective factors for IPV and SV perpetration. An initial sample of 2,000 is desired have adequate power for complex analysis despite attrition."
"9126257","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of the Center for Aging and Population Health - Prevention Research Center (CAPH-PRC) is to promote active life expectancy in older adults by conducting and translating research on the prevention of late life disability. The CAPH-PRC has implemented scalable programs among underserved older adults at high risk for multiple chronic conditions in Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, and rural Pennsylvania (PA) counties since 2001. For this renewal application community needs and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention priorities were considered. The CAPH-PRC multidisciplinary team is proposing several new initiatives and a novel implementation research project designed to reduce obesity and subsequent chronic disease in old age. This aligns well with the Department of Health and Human Services Strategic Framework on Multiple Chronic Conditions as CAPH-PRC efforts promote use of proven self-care management and other services by individuals with multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, through collaborations with state and county Departments of Aging and Health, data resources from health and aging services will be linked to enhance the surveillance of disability and chronic disease in older adults. New technologies, platforms, outreach, and partners will be used to continue to disseminate the 10 KeysTM to Healthy Aging, a long-standing CAPH-PRC community-based program. The program will be delivered to Allegheny County senior centers through webcasts and embedded in APPRISE, a PA Department of Aging program in counties with high rates of chronic disease. Training of public health professionals and community partners, leveraging the experiences of working with our Center as part of existing research and training programs will continue.  The implementation research project will focus on mitigating obesity, which is a risk factor for many chronic diseases. Obesity is increasing more in older adults than any other age group. Concerns about weight loss in older adults have been allayed by the successful impact of healthy lifestyle weight loss and activity programs on improving function without adverse effects. Recent results from the Look AHEAD Trial showed the effectiveness of an intervention for weight loss and improved physical function. This project will systematically implement and sustain an evidence-based weight management intervention, modeled after Look AHEAD, in the community setting. The Mobility and Vitality Lifestyle Program - MOVE UP will 1) adapt, develop and pilot a community-based, translational behavioral weight management program delivered by community health workers, 2) implement and evaluate the program's impact on physical functioning, using a stepped wedge crossover design in obese adult participants aged 60-75 years in underserved communities in Allegheny County, and 3) develop strategies for sustainability considering the cost of the program, organizational capacity, and program adaptation to inform future dissemination."
"9103574","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States, and the second leading cause worldwide. There is consensus that the level of intraocular pressure generates a biomechanical response in the tissues of the optic nerve head that is fundamental to the early events in glaucoma damage. The level and state of stress and strain in the optic nerve head are determined by the mechanical properties of the posterior sclera and lamina cribrosa and how they differ. Mechanical stresses and deformation of the optic nerve head can damage the retinal ganglion cell axons both directly and indirectly through mechanical activation of the lamina cribrosa cells and disruption of blood ?ow from the distortio of blood vessels. We hypothesize that the biomechanical interaction of the sclera and lamina cribrosa is central to the development glaucomatous optic neuropathy. To investigate this hypothesis, we will develop in Aim 1 an innovative microscopic in?ation experiment to measure the local deformation response of the lamina cribrosa of human post-mortem eyes, and examine the effects of scleral behavior measured for the same eye, age, and glaucoma stage. In Aim 2, we will separate the contributions of the extracellular matrix components by measuring changes to the pressure-induced deformation behavior of the lamina cribrosa cause by chemical modi?cations, either stiffening or softening, of only the sclera or of the sclera and lamina cribrosa. We will measure the collagen and elastin structure of the lamina cribrosa in Aim 3 and evaluate for the effects of the scleral ?ber structure measured for the same eye, age, and glaucoma stage. Aim 4 will integrate the data gathered from the mechanical and structural experiments in computational models of the lamina cribrosa and sclera to study the relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties of the tissues. The proposed Aims will advance both the fundamental scienti?c understanding of the pathogenesis of glaucoma and the development of new diagnostic and neuroprotection strategies. The outcomes of Aim 1 will provide the physiological and pathological levels of mechanical stimuli to the tissues of the op- tic nerve head for studies of blood ?ow and mechanical activation of lamina cribrosa cells. The outcomes of Aim 2 will measure the effect of selective scleral stiffening or softening on the stresses and strains in the optic nerve head, thus will guide the development of new scleral neuroprotection strategies. Aims 3 and 4 will provide an understanding of the relationship between the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the lamina cribrosa. This will allow us to predict features that can be identi?ed as biomechanical markers in in vivo optical coherence tomography imaging for new diagnostic strategies. The proposed work will provide the ?rst study of the biomechanics of the lamina cribrosa and the peripapillary sclera in relation to each other in the same eye. It will also provide the ?rst detailed measurements of the effect of selective scleral stiffening and softening on the strain state of the optic nerve head."

"9120240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on its original mission of Meeting Community Needs Across the Prevention Spectrum, the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center remains committed to research pertaining to the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of chronic disease, with a particular emphasis on obesity prevention. The specific aims of the Center are to: maintain and cultivate the requisite resources and infrastructure to support a thriving research agenda; sustain and grow a research agenda that corresponds with the PRC's mission; support a core research project that will serve as a model for the National PRC Network and communities nationwide; grow a network of collaborations and partnerships with local communities; support and facilitate relevant research by others; provide training and education to staff, students, collaborators, and the members of partnering organizations and communities; support a robust and dynamic evaluation program; engage in effective communication and dissemination; and maintain the requisite resources for these functions. The Y-G PRC's primary research agenda for the upcoming 5-year cycle is to address the CDC winnable battle area of nutrition, physical activity, and obesity by using a multisite translatioal community trial (mTCT)1 approach, wherein a standard research protocol and intervention are applied in multiple sites, with tailoring using CBPR principles to meet the needs of each community. The primary study, CHOOSE (Community Health Opportunities Organized with Schools at the Epicenter), an intervention research project, involves communities in CT, MO, and KS, and entails interventions commencing with school districts as epicenters, and expanding within and beyond schools into other portals throughout their respective communities. We plan to compare 4 levels of intervention (See Appendix J) using quasi- experimental methods, with outcomes encompassing behaviors, biometrics, and anthropometrics. A similar approach will be applied in New Haven, CT, but with a focus on patient/hospital-centered rather than school- centered programming. In each case, we plan to reach groups within partnering communities with tailored multidisciplinary interventions, and aggregate the total impact and reach over time. Study objectives are to improve diet and physical activity in school-aged children and adults alike; with secondary goals of improving cardiometabolic health in both children and adults, and academic performance in children, with each measure linked to a validated assessment method. An array of established partnerships used effectively over the past 15 years for dissemination and sustainability will be leveraged to maximize the impact of this work."
"9144799","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macrophage infiltrates play a variety of key roles in the immune defense system, including a central role in innate or natural immunity. We have shown by immunostaining using anti-F4/80 and CD11b antibodies that resident corneal macrophages are not detectable in cornea of uninfected mice. In contrast, following infection of mice with herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), macrophages appear to be the most dominant infiltrate of the eye. Thus, macrophages may play a central role in both exacerbation and control of acute and chronic HSV-1 infection. In line with our previous studies, our Preliminary studies also suggest that: 1. Injection of mice with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) DNA reduced virus replication in the eye and establishment of latency in trigeminal ganglia (TG) of ocularly infected mice. 2. Similar to M-CSF injection, injection of mice with IL-12p35 DNA also reduced virus replication in the eye and establishment of latency in TGs of latently infected mice.  Thus, since macrophages are the most abundant infiltrates in the eye of HSV-1 ocularly infected mice and also appear the fastest in the eye (as early as 4 hours) after ocular infection, we will use macrophage stimulatory factors (i.e., M-CSF and IL-12p35) to reduce virus replication in the eye and establishment of latency in the TGs of ocularly infected mice. We propose to:  Aim: Test the hypothesis that macrophage stimulation by a combination of IL-12p35 and M-CSF DNA as molecular adjuvants will enhance TH1/TC1 responses in the eye and lead to a more rapid clearance of virus from the eye and trigeminal ganglia (TG) during primary ocular HSV-1 infection. This will, lead to a significant reduction in establishment of latency and reactivation in TG of latently infected mice. Our preliminary studies suggest that administration of IL-12p35 and M-CSF DNA improves immunization efficacy as judged by a greater reduction in virus replication in the eye after ocular infection compare with control mice, or mice that are immunized with IL-12p35 or M-CSF alone. This improved efficacy correlated with higher activities of local ocular responses (i.e., IL-2, IFN-a, IFN-ß, IFN- ?). We propose to test the hypothesis that; (1) a cocktail of IL-12p35 and M-CSF DNA will result in reduction in primary virus replication in the eyes as well as reduction of latency in TGs of infected mice; (2) these reductions are associated with generation of strong and rapid TH1/TC1 responses in addition to IFN-a and IFN-ß in the eye and TGs of infected mice; and (3) Co-administration of IL-12p35 + M-CSF + 5gP DNA will further reduce latency in immunized mice compared with mice that treated with 5gP alone. Overall, we expect to determine that a combination of IL-12p35 and M-CSF enhances the cytokine secretion and antigen presentation functions of macrophages rather than their phagocytosis function."
"9151877","Investigating Air Pollution Effects on the Developing Brain and ASD ABSTRACT The goal of this study is to examine the effect of prenatal and early life air pollution exposure on the developing brain, cognitive and adaptive function, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dramatic changes in brain structure and function are well known in early life. The unfolding of autistic behaviors across the first few years of childhood is accompanied by age-specific brain changes that differ between children with ASD and those with typical developmental trajectories. Epidemiologic studies, including our own, suggest that air pollution exposure may increase the risk of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the effect of prenatal and early life air pollution exposure on brain structure and white matter integrity during early childhood has not been studied, though increasing numbers of epidemiologic studies support the presence of neurodevelopmental effects. Here we propose to examine the relationship between prenatal and early life air pollution exposure and longitudinal measures of brain structure and white matter integrity, cognitive and adaptive function, and ASD and related traits in the NIH-funded, Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE) Network Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS). IBIS is a unique network of four clinical sites that enroll infants at high or low familial risk for ASD, allowing for contrast of familial genetic influences. Standardized neuroimaging protocols, along with cognitive, behavior, and ASD assessments, were and are being conducted over regular intervals, creating a rich resource for the study of environmental exposures on the developing brain. We will leverage this valuable resource for the first prospective study of prenatal and early life air pollution effects on very early brain development. Specific aims are: (1) to examine the effect of prenatal and early life air pollution exposure on early longitudinal brain development; (2) to evaluate the effect of prenatal and early life air pollution exposure on the early trajectory of cognitive development and adaptive function; and (3) to assess the effect of prenatal and early life air pollution exposure on the development of ASD and dimensional characteristics of autism. Because air pollutant exposure is common and can be mitigated, the potential public health impact of this study is large. Additionally, identification of a risk factor in very young children provides the opportunity for early intervention where reduction of risk for disordered development is still possible."
"9256709","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an insect borne flavivirus which until recently was found within a narrow equatorial belt from Africa to Asia. ZIKV has emerged across the globe and has reached pandemic levels, spreading to Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America. While ZIKV usually causes mild disease, infection of pregnant women has been suspected to cause a significant increase in babies born with microcephaly in Brazil, starting in late 2015, presumed to have become infected transplacentally a previously unknown route of infection. The association of ZIKV with abnormal brain development in the fetus has been supported by the recent detection of ZIKV RNA sequences and antigens along with neurodegeneration in aborted fetuses and babies that died soon after birth. Thus it is vital that we learn as much as possible of how ZIKV replicates and interacts with its host, including in cells of the CNS. The type I IFN response is an early potent antiviral response to viral invasion that can have a major impact on restricting virus spread as evidenced by significantly increased virus replication and rapid mortality as well as loss of organ tropism barriers observed in mice lacking type I IFN signaling. The CNS expresses low levels of interferon signaling genes compared to peripheral organs suggesting the CNS may be less prepared to restrict viral invasion. In addition, viruses suppress or evade the host immune response in order to facilitate their replication within a host and cause disease and therefore encode proteins with host IFN antagonist activities. The outcome of infection therefore depends on the balance of host immune defenses and virus encoded virulence factors and this can differ among viruses and tissue types. We have carried out extensive studies of IFN signaling responses to neurovirulent murine coronavirus in various cell types in vitro as well as in the CNS and the periphery of mice. We propose to use our expertise as well as information gathered, along with our recent data demonstrating robust replication of ZIKV in human A549 cells where it activates the OAS-RNase L pathway and in primary murine neuronal and glial cell cultures to test the hypothesis that cell type and tissue specific differences in the type I IFN response to ZIKV may contribute to susceptibility of the fetal brain to ZIKV-induced pathology. In Aim 1 we will investigate the IFN signaling pathways during ZIKV infected human A549 cells and CRIPSR/Cas9 engineered knockout A549 cells as well as primary murine neuronal and glial cell cultures. In Aim 2 we will investigate ZIKV replication and IFN response in vivo in embryonic and neonatal mice. Upon completion of these aims we will have gained an understanding of the type I IFN response to ZIKV in vitro in human cells as well as murine CNS cells. We will also know more about IFN signaling in the developing mouse embryo and spread of ZIKV from infected mothers. These two approaches combined will aid in understanding the impact of IFN signaling on ZIKV infection and spread and in the more long term identify targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat ZIKV-induced disease."
"9145695","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and is quickly becoming a global pandemic. Its patients suffer either reduced insulin production or insulin sensitivity, the latter of which has been associated with reduced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in T2DM skeletal muscle. NOS proteins produce the gaseous signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO), which has been implicated in glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. In skeletal muscle, NO is produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), the tissue's primary NOS isoform. Upon insulin stimulation, NO synthesis increases in normal adult skeletal muscle, whereas no such increase is observed in T2DM adults. Additionally, the endothelial NOS (eNOS) isoform in the vasculature is activated via insulin-activated kinase phosphorylation. That nNOS contains a homologous phosphorylation site is suggestive that nNOS, too, may undergo an activating phosphorylation event with insulin treatment. Yet, it remains unknown if or how nNOS is regulated by insulin in skeletal muscle. Our working hypothesis is that skeletal muscle nNOS is phosphorylated and activated by an insulin-activated kinase(s) during insulin signaling, and that under insulin-resistant conditions, this phosphorylation is attenuated. This will be addressed by the following specific aims: 1) establish that skeletal muscle nNOS is phosphorylated in response to insulin in vitro, and that this phosphorylation affects NO production; 2) identify the kinase(s) activated by insulin that phosphorylates skeletal muscle nNOS under insulin treatment in vitro; and 3) demonstrate that skeletal muscle nNOS is phosphorylated in response to insulin in vivo using mouse models, and that this phosphorylation is attenuated under conditions of insulin resistance. These studies will provide training in molecular biochemistry (immunoblot analysis, mass spectrometry, fluorescent activity assays), cell culture (immunocytochemistry, pharmacological inhibitors, siRNA knockdown, dominant-negative inhibition), and animal models (immunohistochemistry, insulin clamping, diet-induced insulin resistance). These studies are innovative because the role of nNOS in skeletal muscle insulin signaling has yet to be explored, despite it being the primary skeletal muscle NOS isoform. The proposed research is significant because it will more fully reveal fundamental function(s) of NOSs in skeletal muscle insulin signaling. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of skeletal muscle insulin signaling and will lead to development of therapeutic targets to improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, as well as a number of other disorders in which nNOS has been implicated. The applicant's career goal is to become an endocrinologist-investigator who utilizes biochemical approaches to metabolic disease. An integrated educational plan and supportive environment ensures the applicant's career development."
"9238132","The Flaviviridae are a family of positive-sense RNA viruses that contain numerous important human pathogens. Many of the molecular mechanisms that underlie how these RNA viruses cause cytopathology and disease are not clearly described. The cellular mRNA decay machinery, in particularly the 5'-3' pathway mediated by the exoribonuclease Xrn1, plays a major role in regulating the abundance and quality of gene expression in the cell. Understudied, but nevertheless very important aspects of flavivirus-host interactions, include how viral RNAs are protected from degradation by the cellular mRNA decay machinery and what are the implications of the viral RNA stabilization strategies on the regulation of cellular mRNA stability. We have recently observed that flaviviruses repress the activity of Xrn1 through trapping the enzyme using unique structured regions of the viral RNA. Interestingly, it is the 5' UTR IRES region that is responsible for this Xrn1 repression in Hepatitis C virus and Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus. These observations serve as the foundation for this proposal to gain in-depth mechanistic insights into molecular mechanisms of Xrn1 repression and regulation that are disrupted by flavivirus RNAs. In Aim 1, we will identify the sequence/structural requirements of IRES-mediated Xrn1 repression and determine whether this is a common property of other viral IRES elements. The goal of Aim 2 is understand at a mechanistic level why the repression of Xrn1 by flavivirus RNAs results in the apparent shut down of the entire 5'-3' mRNA decay pathway ? not just the exonucleolytic digestion step. Uncovering the interplay and feedback regulation of the decay factors in the 5'-3' RNA decay pathway will provide novel insights into how the cell normally regulates this decay pathway and integrate it into the overall process of gene expression. In the third aim we will expand our studies on Xrn1 stalling and investigate whether it is an approach used by the cell to remodel cellular transcripts. In the final Aim, we will characterize key biological aspects of Xrn1 repression from the perspective of both the cell and the virus. A key focus of this part will be on the dysregulation of cellular mRNA stability by flaviviruses that results in dramatic changes in cellular gene expression that could play a significant role in HCV-mediated oncogenesis."

"9071290","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a widespread international health problem that imposes costs of over 600 billion dollars per year. This application focuses on fibromyalgia (FM), which is characterized by persistent, widespread body pain, with significant evidence of altered brain function. One of the few effective treatments for FM is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which has been shown to reduce pain intensity and pain-related disability, potentially via reductions in catastrophizing, an important psychosocial factor that plays a crucial role in shaping individual differences in pain- related outcomes. It is likely that brain mechanisms underpin the beneficial effects of lowered catastrophizing and reduced pain in FM, and CBT-produced decrements in catastrophizing may act to normalize dysfunctional central nervous system pain processing. Our previous study in FM patients confirms that patients who are high in catastrophizing show enhanced pain-related activation in brain areas that process emotional aspects of pain (e.g., anterior insula and medial thalamus). In addition, catastrophizing was associated with altered pain-evoked functional connectivity between thalamus, anterior insula, and default mode network (DMN) structures such as medial prefrontal cortex. The DMN is a constellation of brain regions that mediate self- focused cognitive processing; our prior work has implicated altered resting-state functional connectivity between DMN and insula as a biomarker for clinical pain in FM. In our pilot study, a subset of FM patients was randomized to CBT or an active educational control condition. We found that CBT reduced catastrophizing and produced corresponding changes in brain activation and DMN connectivity. In the present proposal, we hypothesize that CBT-produced improvements in pain will be anticipated and mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and their associated effects on pain-related brain functioning. Participants with FM will be randomized to 8 weekly treatments with CBT or an education/attention control, and followed up for 6 months. Functional MRI data, including functional connectivity during both a resting and evoked deep- tissue pain state, will be collected at baseline, mid-treatment, and after the final treatment visit. We hypothesize that CBT will reduce catastrophizing early in treatment, resulting in adaptive changes in the brain's responses to an externally-applied noxious stimulus. These changes will then predict subsequent changes in patients' resting state connectivity in DMN and pain- relevant brain regions, which will underlie long-term improvements in clinical pain. Our overarching goal is to understand the neurobiological pathways by which CBT and reduced catastrophizing facilitate improvements in chronic pain; such information will help to refine biopsychosocial models of pain, identify potential non-responders early in treatment, and facilitate the enhancement of psychosocial interventions for chronic musculoskeletal pain."
"9225317","ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 2 million individuals in the United States each year, ranging from mild concussions to severe trauma or death. TBI survivors endure long-lasting cognitive impairments associated with frontal lobe damage, as well as psychpathological consequences. TBI models in the laboratory have been associated for decades with declines in long-term learning and memory, although the types of behavioral tests performed to date have not focused on the complex attention impairments related to frontal lobe injury or dysfunction, which are common in most TBIs. Specifically, higher-order cognitive processes such as cognitive flexibility and behavioral inhibition are markedly affected by TBI and are essential to directing and focusing cognitive activity on specific stimuli or using environmental feedback to ?unlearn? a previously valid set of rules, switch gears and filter unwanted distractions, respectively. The overarching aim of this proposal is to assess clinically-relevant cognitive-behavioral dimensions sensitive to frontal lobe TBI, and to begin to address mechanistic questions regarding altered neurotransmission responsible for such behavioral deficits by restoring cognitive performance with chronic treatment of milnacipran, a novel, dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Specifically, the aims are designed to 1) employ a multimodal approach to determine higher-order cognitive flexibility capabilities after moderate TBI to the frontal lobe by using two different, yet well-validated attentional set-shifting tasks, the operant and digging paradigms, which have not been utilized after experimental brain trauma, 2) assess the efficacy of a promising, novel dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant and nootropic properties, milnacipran, and 3) evaluate TBI-induced changes in brain markers of monoamine synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine ?- hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase), storage/release (vesicular monoamine transporter 2), and reuptake (norepinephrine- and serotonin- transporters) in discrete brain regions critical for directly or indirectly modulating cognitive flexibility and executive function. The proposed studies will be carried out in both male and normal cycling female rats, an approach that is clinically relevant. Specifically, females represent up to 45% of the TBI cases with injuries occuring independent of estrous stage and therefore evaluating normal cycling females parallels the real world. Integrating animal models of higher-order cognition in the standard neurotrauma battery of behavior after frontal TBI, exploring novel therapeutic targets, as well as assessing monoamine regulation in cortical regions not well studied after TBI is paramount to developing therapeutic and rehabilitative approaches more relevant to the clinic. This two-year R21 exploratory/developmental research grant will generate preliminary data that will serve as proof-of-concept for a NIH R01 individual grant application, allowing future work to also further evaluate potential pharmacological and rehabilitative therapies for TBI-induced cognitive dysfunction.  "
"9201827","Project Summary/Abstract  An estimated 15 million adults in the United States currently provide informal care to relatives and friends with Alzheimer?s disease. The economic contribution of informal caregivers? service is estimated in the billions, and is the cornerstone of care for the 5.3 million people with the disease. While informal caregivers undoubtedly perform an important role, the responsibilities are challenging and potentially impact caregivers? own health and quality of life. Compared with caregivers of people without dementia, twice as many caregivers of people with dementia indicate substantial emotional and physical difficulties and have higher rates of depressed mood, cardiovascular disease, and reduced immune functioning. There is, therefore, a need to alleviate stress and enable caregivers to better cope with the demands and take care of their own health and wellbeing. Interventions have been developed to assist caregivers; however, there exist limited programs on coping and self-care accessible to Alzheimer?s caregivers outside of clinic settings. Web-based services have the advantage of flexibility in access, scalability in scope, and tailoring of individual training needs.  The purpose of this project will be to develop an interactive web-based stress and coping program reflective of the stages and unique challenges of caring for someone with Alzheimer?s disease and consistent with the literature on protective mechanisms. The program will focus on self-care and coping skills and will be designed to improve psychological wellbeing, physical health, and promote positive coping. ISA Associates, in partnership with a team of expert consultants and the Redmon Group, will develop and pilot test the prototype during Phase I of the project. The primary objectives of Phase I are to (1) lay the groundwork for developing a product capable of addressing the personal care needs of Alzheimer?s caregivers, (2) determine the technology that is best suited for helping caregivers, and (3) conduct an analysis and test of the program to promote our scientific understanding of caregivers needs and best practices.  To accomplish these objectives ISA will build on its? extensive experience in developing health-related interventions, most notably the Breathe stress management program, the Healthy Past 50 Program, and the Caregiver SmartTools Program. In Phase I, ISA will conduct 2 pre-development focus groups to determine the content and technical needs of program users. ISA will work with experts in the fields of gerontology and social work to create a science-driven and functionally relevant program. Following these activities, project staff will develop the prototype for the program ? fully developing the Introduction, Assessment, Feedback, and Module 1 during Phase I and developing the structure for the Phase II modules. A review of the prototype and a comparison website will be conducted, with participants rating the two websites to determine the feasibility of the program in meeting program goals. If the prototype program passes these established feasibility criteria, it will be fully developed, tested in an experimental field design, and prepared for marketing during Phase II."
"9133864","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to continue the work of UNC's existing PRC (Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention - HPDP) but with a new focus on the link between community and health care efforts to prevent and control disease (CDC Domain 4), by developing and testing a technology-assisted community health worker implementation strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention with initial emphasis on low income, rural communities with large populations of underserved minorities. To support this effort and the broader work of the Center in its role to enhance public health practice through high quality research, HPDP will build new capacity in dissemination and implementation (D&I) research, adding faculty expertise in systems dynamic modeling and health services research. In addition, faculty with research and practice experience in health information technology and patient centered medical homes will join the team. The Center will collaborate with statewide stakeholders to disseminate EBIs and build public health practitioners' capacity to implement EBIs that target all levels of the socio-ecologic model. The center will build on community collaborations over the past 25 years to address the winnable battles -- nutrition, physical activity, obesity, and tobacco --that are most relevant to CVD prevention and treatment. Our efforts will be guided by NCCDPHP (CDC) strategic priorities (health equity, research translation, systems solutions, and sustainability) and the National Prevention Strategy (healthy community environments, quality preventive services, empowering personal health choices). Currently there is a widely recognized gap in coordination between primary care and public health. Community Health Workers have demonstrated the potential to significantly impact chronic disease risk factors, but coordinated programs between clinic and public health departments that collaborate with community health workers have not been adequately tested. The applied research project for this proposal, referred to as CHANGE (Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity) is designed to create and test new structures to leverage the complementary strengths of clinics and public health departments coordinated through technology-assisted community health workers, thereby expanding the reach and effectiveness of both clinical and community multi-level evidence-based interventions. The research design includes formative data collection to refine the CHANGE strategy; a pre-post comparison to assess implementation and effectiveness; a matched-control pre- post comparison to assess the CHANGE strategy's effects on the proportion of the clinic's total at-risk population that have cholesterol and blood pressure under control as compared to three matched comparison clinics; and finally planning for taking the CHANGE strategy to scale by replicating it in one additional community, identifying its core components, creating and disseminating a replication toolkit, and promoting the strategy's adoption through NC's multiple clinical, public health, and research networks."
"9320319","The proposed project will use information from the placenta in early pregnancy (also called the gestational sac (GS)) to estimate environmental risks to the health of the newborn. According to population-wide biomonitor- ing studies, fetuses in the U.S. are exposed to a long list of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that enter our bodies primarily through packaged and processed food and personal care product use. EDCs, such as phthalates and perfluoroalklyl chemicals (PFCs), can alter developmental pathways in the rodent fetus with consequences for the genitalia, brain, immune system, and body mass index. We have established a relation- ship using epidemiologic and experimental methods between phthalate exposures, sex-specific disruption of a placental hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and the distance between the anus and the genitalia in the newborns. Anogenital distance (AGD) is a marker of hormonal actions in utero and is predictive of fertility in the adult. Hence, we have offered a novel conceptual framework for the role of the early placenta or the gestational sac (GS) in endocrine disruption. We theorize that the role of the GS is distinct from the pla- centa proper, which forms at 10 weeks when maternal perfusion and nutrient transport begins. In this project we will extend this model to ask the question if the phthalate-hCG-genital relationship can be generalized to a) a class of persistent EDCs that also enter our bodies from processed and packaged food; b) a set of 5 other candidate molecules that are synthesized and secreted by the placenta and correlated with hCG; and c) other endpoints in the neonate that reflect sex-specific development. First, we will measure the real-time relationship between maternal exposures to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) in the earliest stage of pregnancy and their correlation with hormones and other molecules that are secreted and/or regulated by the GS. Secondly, we will measure outcomes in the male and female newborns that indicate differences in genital development, birth size, and adiposity or prenatal programming of obesity and other metabolic disorders. The outcomes in the neonates were selected, as they are predictive of longer-term health outcomes in the child and in the adult. Using statistical techniques, we will determine if the first trimester placental response to EDCs mediated the overall `effect' of the EDC exposure on neonatal outcomes. Thirdly, we will analyze the placental tissue (sam- pled at delivery) transcriptome for the global expression of coding and non-coding RNA levels. We will test the correspondence between the placental molecular signature (by sex and by phthalate) at the end of pregnancy with the placental secretion profile in early pregnancy. With these same data, we will test a hypothesis from our pilot studies on a specific type of epigenetic regulation of the transcriptome that may explain on a molecular level how phthalates induce a sex-specific response in the placenta. By testing a unified theory on the role of the GS, we will contribute to innovation in strategies to identify obstetric and developmental risks at early time points in pregnancy, and possibly within a timeframe to reduce risks to the child."
"9269870","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The biomedical value of identifying the genes and variants responsible for Mendelian disorders is extraordinarily high. The clinical manifestations of these disorders involve virtually all organ systems and their developmental and physiological parameters. About half of recognized Mendelian disorders (as enumerated in the OMIM database) remain unexplained at the molecular level and many more of these remain to be recognized. Over the last 3.25 years, the Baylor College of Medicine and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine human genetics programs have combined and formed the Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics (BHCMG) to find Mendelian genes. In doing so, we have taken advantage of the synergies afforded by combining our expertise in clinical genetics, genomic technologies, genetic analysis and understanding the biological basis of genetic disease. We have met and will continue to meet the challenge of research subjects by utilizing our worldwide network of colleagues and former trainees. Using state of the art genomic methods and analytic tools, we have already sequenced the exome or the genome of 5,443 individuals, identifying 169 novel disease genes in the first 3.25 years of funding, and have more than 4,000 samples ready to sequence from collaborators in the USA and >20 other countries. In the future, we will expand this network of collaborators to identify even more samples. We have also developed automated processes to contact the authors of publications from unexplained Mendelian disorders in OMIM to recruit additional specific disease examples. We have designed and passed through the IRB an online consenting process that bypasses the bottlenecks of time difference and language in international and remote site recruiting. To streamline and monitor our progress we have developed PhenoDB, a web-based tool for the collection, storage and analysis of disease, phenotypic feature and genotype information. PhenoDB also tracks samples, and is updated with the deliberations of our expert committees for Phenotype Review and ELSI issues. We have and will continue to build on our existing high throughput sequencing pipelines and have developed integrated laboratory and analysis efforts with experts from both institutions to develop new methods and software to advance the field. We have and will disseminate the phenotype and molecular information through publication, lectures, posting to communal websites and dbGaP. To connect clinicians and scientists with interest in the same gene and accelerate confirmation of novel disease gene identification, we developed GeneMatcher, now part of the MatchMaker Exchange initiative involving geneticists around the world. Going forward, to educate health care providers and trainees, we plan to develop a Massive Open Online Course in genetics, and to educate the public while enhancing recruitment, we will develop a set of online educational videos."
"9166349","PROJECT SUMMARY The current pandemic of obesity and insulin resistance across the lifespan presents an immense public health challenge. Human observational studies and fecal transplantation studies in animal models (both largely focused on adults) have found an interconnection among obesity, insulin resistance, and the microbiota. Because epidemiology points to childhood origins for the genesis of obesity, there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms of pediatric obesity and to develop tools for its prediction, prevention, and treatment. Children with severe obesity mimic adult phenotypes in their development of metabolic and cardiovascular risk, and yet are at the earliest stages of disease with fewer and less severe co-morbid conditions. Thus children with obesity present a unique opportunity and an ideal population in which to garner deeper insights into the obesity-associated microbiome. To enable such insights, the objective of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive research resource to define mechanisms underlying microbial regulation of host metabolism in adolescents with obesity (ages 12-18 yrs) before and after weight loss intervention. The proposed research leverages Duke?s unique and well-established intervention program for pediatric obesity and insulin resistance. Our prior studies have applied metabolomic technology to reveal that blood metabolites such as branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are negatively associated with insulin sensitivity following adult weight loss interventions, and we have used gnotobiotic mice to demonstrate their positive association with microbiota-mediated weight gain. Our preliminary studies indicate that BCAA and related metabolites are also associated with insulin resistance and weight gain in adolescents. Our central hypothesis is that human gut bacteria control host weight gain and insulin resistance in adolescents by modifying host metabolism. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: Aim 1. Develop a resource to define associations between intestinal microbiota and a severely obese population of adolescents enrolled in an outpatient weight management intervention program. Aim 2. Define the molecular mechanisms by which human intestinal bacteria regulate metabolic traits linked to pediatric obesity. Completion of this work will provide three key resources for broad use by the scientific community: (1) a clinical sample, microbiota strain, and data repository from a unique pediatric weight management intervention cohort, (2) a comprehensive suite of robust genetic, molecular profiling, and phenotyping technologies that will yield unique insights into the microbial communities that control body weight and responses to obesity intervention, and (3) insights into molecular mechanisms by which BCAA and other identified microbial products influence metabolic health during childhood and adolescence. These new resources, technologies, and mechanistic insights will have a positive impact by advancing the long-term objective of reducing adolescent obesity and developing effective, durable therapeutics."
"9055990","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objectives of this study are to characterize the effects of environmental manganese (Mn) exposure on adolescent neurodevelopment. Although long known to be a critical neurodevelopmental period in pediatrics/psychology, little is known about the impact of toxic chemical exposures on neurophenotypes in adolescence. Mn is a compelling neurotoxicant to study in adolescence because: i) Mn is an essential trace metal, but it is also neurotoxic at elevated exposures; ii) th catecholaminergic system is a well-known target of Mn, and adolescence neurodevelopment involves substantial changes to the dopaminergic system, iii) Mn exposure is more ubiquitous than previously recognized, but its role in altering brain development is not well known, and iv) there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the impacts of Mn in adolescence. Preliminary results from our initial grant period show that elevated Mn exposure during pre/early adolescence is associated with deficits in attention, neuromotor, cognitive, and olfactory function  in children. We will build upon these findings in a cohort of 240 adolescents to determine: 1) the role of Mn exposure timing on adolescent executive function, behavior, and self-regulation by applying novel exposure biomarkers and statistical methods to identify and define critical developmental windows of susceptibility, and 2) functional and anatomical neurophenotypes that are impacted by Mn, focusing on brain areas that subserve executive function, behavior, and self-regulation in adolescence (e.g., Pre-Frontal Cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala) using functional and anatomical MRI. Our established PHIME (Public Health Impact of Manganese Exposure) cohort presents a unique opportunity to achieve these important goals. PHIME was designed to investigate long-term Mn exposure timing; it consists of subjects (now adolescents) living in three well-characterized communities in Northern Italy that differ in the timing and intensity of environmental Mn exposure from current or historic ferromanganese alloy plant operations. Moreover, recent innovations in exposure science now allow us to retrospectively reconstruct Mn exposure across fetal life/early childhood using a novel tooth biomarker of exposure. These studies will be among the first to longitudinally assess the role of environmental Mn on adolescent neurodevelopment and behavior and to objectively determine critical exposure windows that can inform the timing of future public health interventions."
"9175132","Prevention of cognitive decline and delay of onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are public health priorities, and improving brain health is a firm commitment of the National Institutes of Health. Since ambient air pollution exposures are pervasive and modifiable, they are an appropriate target for research on brain health. Evidence for air pollution links to neurodegeneration is accumulating with recent studies implicating fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), oxides of nitrogen (NOx and NO2) and traffic-related pollution in lower cognitive function, cognitive decline, incidence of AD and all-cause dementia, and brain atrophy. The effects of air pollutants on neuropathology in the aging brain are unknown. Deeper understanding of air pollutants as potential risk factors will lead to better characterization of disease mechanisms. Improvements in public health will follow since air pollution exposures can be modified by changes in regulations and individual behaviors. Few epidemiological studies have been well-positioned to overcome many of the inherent weaknesses in exposure assessment, study design, and outcome data availability, including a unique set of neuropathology measures, needed to advance our understanding of the role of time-varying air pollution exposures on cognitive health, AD, and aging. This study is a unique collaboration between leading experts in the fields of aging and AD research, statistical, and environmental health sciences. It will use a long-term prospective cohort study design to examine the effects of air pollution on cognitive decline, all-cause dementia and AD incidence, and brain neuropathologies. It leverages the community-based sample of 5,088 adults free of dementia at the time of enrollment from the NIA-funded Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. ACT is an outstanding resource representative of the community with prospective, long-term (up to 20 years), and high- quality cognitive follow-up, careful diagnosis of incident dementia by subtype, and outstanding data availability including 633 brain autopsies, genetic data, and decades of extensive medical, and residential history data extending decades prior to study enrollment. We will collect new air pollution measurements to develop for ACT participants state-of-the-art long-term average air pollution predictions for ambient PM2.5, O3, NOx, and NO2 of the highest quality to address our study hypotheses. Our overarching goal is to identify air pollution risk factors and quantify their effects in order to promote healthy aging. This study provides an extraordinary opportunity to advance our comprehensive understanding of the effects of air pollution exposures on cognition in the aging brain and on risk of AD. It aligns well with the 2012-2017 NIEHS Strategic Plan by advancing fundamental research using state-of-the-art exposure science."
"9121534","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the most common craniofacial birth defect (1/500 to 1/1000 live births), cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) has a considerable impact on society. Treatment is intensive and prolonged, as surgical procedures are carried out from 3-6 months of age into adolescence. Dentistry, orthodontics and speech therapy continue into adulthood. Currently, our understanding of the cellular and molecular events perturbed in CL/P is inadequate. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a fundamental cellular behavior believed to play a critical role in palatal fusion during embryonic craniofacial development. While  in the chick EMT has also been demonstrated in the fusion of the facial processes that form the upper lip, it is debated whether it mediates this process in mammals. Because mice and humans share similar morphogenetic processes during craniofacial development, the mouse is a suitable model to study craniofacial morphogenesis and its abnormalities. The Pbx family of transcription factors (TFs) play critical roles in craniofacial development. Mouse embryos deficient for Pbx1 and Pbx2 (Pbx1/Pbx2) display CL/P with 100% penetrance and offer a new model for human CL/P. Here, mouse embryos with conditional loss of Pbx1 in the cephalic epithelium on a Pbx2-deficient background will be used to establish the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying CL/P in vivo. Preliminary data highlight that: 1) Pbx1/Pbx2 loss causes persistence of the epithelial seams at the frontonasal processes, which do not fuse and yield CL/P; 2) Cells at the seams normally exhibit the mesenchymal marker vimentin, whereas in Pbx1/Pbx2 mutants they do not; 3) Pbx1 is upregulated during TGFb-mediated EMT in an epithelial cell culture system; and 4) Pbx1 over-expression in epithelial cells gives EMT phenotypes in culture. Given these results, it is hypothesized that Pbx1 acts as a novel regulator of EMT in midface morphogenesis. To test this hypothesis, Pbx1 requirements for EMT in lip morphogenesis/fusion will be dissected in vivo at the cellular (Aim1A) and molecular level (Aim1B). The effect of Pbx1 loss on cellular morphology and identity at the epithelial seam junction will be established by Electron Microscopy, Immunofluorescence with mesenchymal and epithelial markers, and genetic fate mapping of epithelial cells in mouse embryos. It will then be determined whether Snail1, a critical effector of EMT, is an in vivo target of Pbx1 at the seam junction by Chromatin Immuno Precipitation of embryonic midfaces with Pbx1 specific antibodies. Functionality of Pbx1 binding on Snail1 expression will be established by transient transfections in cultured cells. These studies will establish whether Pbx1 is required for EMT in vivo in the embryonic midface and if it executes this program by directly targeting Snail1. In parallel, Pbx1 requirements in a cellular system of EMT will be assessed using over-expression (Aim2A) and knock-down approaches (Aim2B) to uncover whether Pbx1 is sufficient and/or necessary to induce EMT in epithelial cells. Knowledge gained thorough these studies will improve prenatal diagnostics of CL/P and drive future pharmacological and tissue engineering approaches for repair."

"9272111","Summary/Abstract  Vascular cognitive impairment dementia (VCID) is a heterogeneous disease that is an important cause of dementia. This proposal is in response to a RFA to identify biomarkers to separate patients into subgroups for treatment trials. Although much is known about multiple biomarkers individually, there is a major gap in our understanding of the optimal ones to use in collaborative studies, which is the aim of this proposal. Subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) is the progressive small vessel disease (SVD) form that is optimal for treatment trials. MRI modalities and CSF biochemical studies provide the most promising biomarkers. White matter damage is the hallmark of SIVD, and MRI is the optimal method to show the progressive changes. Biochemical studies of CSF show the inflammatory biomarkers of albumin, matrix metaloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokines. In an on-going clinical study of SIVD, our group has identified microstructural studies with MRI and biochemical studies of MMPs in the CSF as the two most promising biomarkers. This two-phase, milestone-driven proposal is to identify the optimal microstructural and biochemical biomarkers to both identify the SIVD subgroup and to use as surrogate markers of progression. In the first U2 phase, the optimal method to measure CSF MMPs will be determined for patient classification and the optimal MRI biomarkers to show progression will be determined. Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), which is a region with normal FLAIR signal, often has abnormal diffusion signals, indicating tissue at risk (prodromal). The hypothesis is that CSF and MRI biomarkers can be used for classification of SIVD patients with CSF for primarily classification and MRI for both classification and as a surrogate marker for predicting disease progression that can be used for patient treatment decisions. There are three specific aims: 1) to demonstrate that the growth of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) as defined by FLAIR images can be predicted based on biomarkers calculated from multi-shell, high b-value diffusion MRI (dMRI); 2) to identify functional brain connectivity, structural brain connectivity and gray matter atrophy biomarkers that predict cognitive decline (executive and memory function) in VCID subjects over a period of two to three years; and, 3) to compare MMP measurements made with zymography with two novel methods, including an ELISA-based method and an activity assay based on immunocapture and fluorescent peptide cleavage in order to optimize the biochemical studies. This proposal will fill a gap in knowledge as to the optimal biomarkers to use for collaborative studies. The major aims are related to refining the set of biomarkers for patient selection, which will be done in the U2 phase by increasing the size of the existing University of New Mexico (UNM) cohort from 100 to 200 patients, and to perform the CSF studies for patient classification and the dMRI studies longitudinally to define surrogate markers to use for outcome measures in clinical trials in the U3 phase. The long-term goal is to have the biomarkers in place by the time the future treatment trials are planned in the fifth year."
"9292168","ABSTRACT ? PROJECT 1 FTLD-tau exhibits imbalanced tau proteostasis (intra- and inter-cellar) and neuronal dysfunction. However, little is known about how the accumulation and spread of pathogenic tau could occur, and how it could affect neuronal and synaptic functions. As an integral part of the Center, project 1 (P1)'s objective is to dissect mechanisms underlying aberrant neuronal activity and tau distribution in FTD. We combine unbiased and hypothesis-driven approaches, which are extremely powerful but cannot be achieved without the structure of the Center. We propose three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will define FTD mutations-induced aberrant tau post-translational modifications (PTMs) and dissect how acetylation stimulates tau release with P3. Aim 1 will also be complemented by transcriptome analyses of the FTD mutation effects in P2. In Aim 2, we will determine how FTLD-tau alters neuronal activity and activity-dependent tau release. We will expand on our preliminary study that V337M human neurons exhibit hyperexcitability with impaired homeostatic regulation of axon initial segment (AIS). We will systematically compare neuronal and synaptic activity in isogenic FTD mutant and control lines by whole-cell recordings. Working with mass-spec (MS) core, we will also dissect the mechanism underlying the activity-dependent tau release by dissecting tau interactome in response to high KCL (MS core). CRISPRi/a will then be performed to examine how modulating hits from interactome study would affect activity-dependent tau release (CRISPR core). Aim 2 in P1 will be complemented by P2, which correlates neuronal activity with transcriptome, and P3, which examines the crosstalk between neuronal activity and tau degradation pathways. In Aim 3, we will determine how FTD mutations affect pathogenic tau seeding. Pathogenic seeding is a key feature in tauopathy, but little is known about its mechanisms and functional outcome. We will compare neuronal and synaptic activity in receiving human neurons positive or negative for FRET signal resulting from tau oligomerization. To dissect the mechanisms mediating pathogenic seeding, we will compare the proteome associated with internalized mutant or WT tau seeds in human neurons (MS core). Proteins selectively linked with mutant tau will be prioritized as potential hits. Working with CRISPR core, we will inhibit/activate selected genes from the seeding proteome, and measure the outcome by FRET signal and whole-cell recordings. The proteomic approach in Aim 3 will be complemented by the genome-wide screening to identify pathways in internalization using unbiased approach (P2 and CRISPR core). Together with P2 and P3, P1 will contribute to our overall vision of dissecting the crosstalk between tau proteostasis imbalance and neuronal dysfunction."
"9094973","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand how physical signals complement chemical signals for modulating cellular functions and interactions with the environment. Adherent cells generate mechanical forces to propel migration and drive environment remodeling. They also use mechanical forces to probe the environment, sense their own physical state, communicate with neighboring cells, and possibly coordinate functions within the cell. Previous studies suggested that these physical interactions regulate cell growth, differentiation, and migration, and affect a broad range of health-related issues such as tissue repair and cancer. This project will apply a combination of materials, microfabrication, micromanipulation, microfluidic, and computational approaches to understand mechanical activities and their regulation at the front and rear of a migrating cell. The first aimis designed to determine how the front end of a cell detects surface rigidity and how cellular mechanical output is regulated in relation to the state of migration. The second aim is designed to determine how the rear end of a cell is positioned, and how microtubules, centrosomes, and intracellular tension may regulate the process. Information from this project will have a broad impact on human health, particularly tissue regeneration, embryogenesis, and cancer treatment."
"9220973","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal is to continue longitudinal follow-up of the population-based Michigan Lupus Epidemiology & Surveillance (MILES) Program Cohort and Biobank. The overarching goal is to prospectively collect data and biospecimens that will allow for comprehensive investigations related to risk factors for lupus onset, progression, and comorbidities. To date, the baseline round of Cohort visits has been completed, and the first follow-up round of visits is ongoing. Detailed data collection encompasses measures related to sociodemographics, health/wellness, reproductive health, physical function, environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, and genetics. Lupus-specific measures, including disease activity indices, are measured for the SLE cases. The state-of-the-art biobank includes serum, plasma, DNA/RNA (from lymphocyte subsets), urine, hair, and toenail clippings. Biobank specimens are processed and stored in appropriate conditions to provide the capacity to perform assays including contemporary immunoassays, biomarkers of disease and exposure, and DNA methylation of relevant lymphocyte subsets. Major thematic areas that the MILES Cohort & Biobank is designed to support include epigenetics, environmental epidemiology, and renal lupus. The MILES Cohort will thus serve as a robust platform for ongoing and future research investigations that are relevant to the full spectrum of lupus and its complications."

"9239480","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research will determine whether acute administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa will reverse the impact of inflammation on functional connectivity within reward circuitry as well as anhedonia and psychomotor retardation in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Biomarkers of inflammation, such as inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins like C-reactive protein (CRP), are reliably elevated in a significant proportion of patients with mood disorders. Furthermore, administration of cytokines or cytokine inducers to laboratory animals and humans is associated with depressive symptoms including anhedonia, a core symptom of depression that reflects impaired reward processing. Previous neuroimaging findings demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines produce behavioral changes in part through effects on striatal dopamine. For example, inflammatory stimuli have been shown to decrease neural activation of the ventral striatum to hedonic reward and to decrease striatal dopamine release in association with reduced effort-based motivation for reward. Moreover, our recently published data in patients with MDD have demonstrated a relationship between increased inflammation (as measured by plasma CRP and inflammatory cytokines) and decreased functional connectivity within ventral and dorsal striatal to ventromedial prefrontal cortical circuitry, which was in turn associated with anhedonia and psychomotor slowing, respectively. Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that acute administration of the dopamine precursor, levodopa, can reverse these alterations in corticostriatal connectivity in patients with increased inflammation. These findings indicate that inflammation-related decreases in mesolimbic dopamine may cause reduced connectivity within reward-related corticostriatal circuitry leading to symptoms of anhedonia and psychomotor retardation, which are common to a number of psychiatric disorders and are often resistant to treatment with standard therapies. Thus, the proposed research will test the hypotheses that 1) administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa will increase connectivity in reward-related brain regions in depressed patients with high but not low inflammation, and 2) levodopa will decrease symptoms of anhedonia and psychomotor retardation (assessed using objective and clinical measures of motivation and motor speed) in association with increased connectivity within reward- related brain regions. To test these hypotheses, we will use resting state and task-based functional MRI, task- based and clinical assessments of RDoC constructs of positive and negative valence, and a pharmacological challenge strategy using levodopa. The proposed research will establish the role of dopamine in the effects of inflammation on reward circuitry and related behavior. In addition, the proposed studies will elucidate reliable imaging biomarkers that will allow determination of target engagement in the brain of novel therapeutic strategies that modulate dopamine pathways to reverse the effects of inflammation on motivation and motor function in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders including depression."
"9167281","Project Summary: Origins of human blood lineages in regenerative medicine  Since its original implementation in the 1950s, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has become the most successful and widely used regenerative cell therapy. Approximately 19,000 patients in the United States received HCT in 2013 and it is currently the standard of care for many myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, as well as blood- and immune-deficiencies. However, there is an urgent need to develop new sources of human hematopoietic material, expand current sources, and manipulate cells in order minimize adverse events and maximize disease free survival. While CD34 expression represents the single most robust cell surface marker to identify hematopoietic stem and progenitor activity in the human less than 1% of even CD34+ cells purified for transplantation represent a long- term engrafting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). Furthermore, the vast majority of engrafting cells are poorly understood immune effector cells (lymphoid and myeloid-derived) and erythroid precursors (i.e. normoblasts and megakarocytes) that have the most immediate regenerative effect and often persist for a decade or more.  A reason for this knowledge gap is human hematopoiesis is based on a discrete hierarchical model of cellular differentiation that starts from a single, multi-potent cell (HSC) and has a conventional framework for identifying cells at each stage. However, these stage-based definitions are functional distinction where less than half of defined cells can actually execute these functions. Moreover, the majority of CD34+ cells in human hematopoietic tissue do not even fit into these discrete populations. Thus, the model is broken! Instead, we are proposing a more realistic view of early human hematopoiesis, where cells differentiate in continuous fashion and lineage fate is based more on probability with most cells following a predictable functional path, while some exhibit higher plasticity for transitioning between lineages. This model offers a more holistic view of hematopoietic immune system development and attempts to reconcile many of the conflicting views and results of the past.  These challenges have long existed because elucidating complex cellular relationships in primary human tissue is technically difficult due to limited materials and the ability to manipulate and measure them. Now, the increased parameterization of cytometry has driven the understanding of cellular diversity and molecular processes, respectively. Emerging single-cell proteomic technologies have enabled the simultaneous measurement of an unprecedented large number of cellular features. In particular, CyTOF mass cytometry, a next-generation single cell analysis platform that we pioneered, uses non-biological elemental mass reporters in the place of traditional fluorophores. The throughput of this approach and computational methods it affords facilitates the analysis of complex cellular systems with little need for enrichment or prior knowledge. With these resources at our disposal we will investigate the organization of early human hematopoietic immune cell ontogeny (i.e. formation of effector immune cells and blood cells). In this comprehensive endeavor we will look at this specification of CD34+ cells across primary hematopoietic immune tissues (bone marrow, cord blood, tonsil, thymus, etc.) with the goal of 1) characterizing and developmentally ordering the earliest human hematopoietic cell types, 2) identifying their molecular regulators (transcription factors, epigenetic markers, regulatory enzymes and modifications) inferring their probabilistic relationship with cell fate, and 3) bridging cellular relationships and identities across different hematopoietic cell sources in order to reconcile observed differences and developmental relationships.  Thus, by simultaneously examining the single cell proteomic features of multiple primary tissues spanning human hematopoiesis, this application has the lofty goal of providing a predictive snapshot of early human hematopoietic immune developmental process without the need for cellular synchronization or manipulation. More importantly, translation of these approaches can be applied directly to clinical biopsies and blood specimens. Using novel single cell measurement modalities and analytical tools, this process will establish a comprehensive view of human hematopoiesis that will serve as a baseline for understating pathologic perturbations in disease and manipulating these tissues for therapeutic purposes. More broadly, this work will create a roadmap for applying these methods to other tissue types and corrupted developmental processes, having impact on future studies of developing human systems."

"9010310","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose data production to expand, enhance, and harmonize a new, recently disseminated, publicly accessible but still incomplete database for Latin American mortality (LAMBdA). Currently the data base contains about 400 life tables documenting close to 170 hundred years of mortality for 19 countries (see webLAMBdA). We propose to (a) collect missing raw data to complete the series beginning in 1820 and update the database as needed, (b) formulate new methods and fine-tune those already implemented to enrich the database with multiple mortality estimates per country-year, (c) introduce adjusted cause of death information and associated cause-specific life tables (d) extend life tables in single years of age up to 100; (e) use mixed methods to construct cohorts life tables; and (f) harmonize LAMBdA with other mortality data. The final product will be a database ready for use in comparative mortality analyses, estimation of old age mortality models, fine-tuned population projections and forecasts, and to study the evolution of longevity in a region with a singular history of mortality decline and currently experiencing demographic aging of unprecedented speed. We also propose data analyses on LAMBdA (and other databases) to test both standard and new theories of old age mortality and longevity. To do so we use the enriched version of LAMBdA (and other databases) to estimate a broad spectrum of statistics that inform trajectories of old age mortality, to estimate new model life table patterns, to formulate new formal models of old age mortality and test their predictions and, finally, to develop and employ a platform for statistical inference about mortality including multiple estimates and assessment of associated levels of uncertainty. The analyses will shed light on processes that could improve (worsen) the course of longevity in countries with adverse economic, social, and institutional conditions. These analyses will complement and extend those carried out in high income countries and will improve our understanding of trajectories of human longevity.  1Acronyms used throughout the text: LAMBdA: Latin American Mortality Database<website> HMD: Human Mortality Database<website> LAC: Latin American and Caribbean countries webLAMBdA LAMBdA official web site<www.ssc.wisc.edu/cdha/latinmortality>"

IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOTHERAPY PROGRAM  The Immunology and Immunotherapy of Cancer Program (IM) represents a merger of the former Cancer  Immunology and Immunotherapy and the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Immune Reconstitution  Programs that took place with the approval of the External Advisory Board in 2012. The major overall goals  of the program are to understand the nature of the immune system and its response to malignancies and to  explore auto- and allo-immune responses to cancer with the goal of enabling the discovery and  development of more effective anti-tumor immunotherapy. These goals will be achieved by fostering  collaborative research, advancing the latest technologies to probe immunological mechanisms, and by  enhancing the infrastructure for clinical translation. Research by program members has resulted in exciting  new developments in both understanding immune function and developing novel therapies. Advances  include the development and application of CyTOF and high throughput sequencing for evaluating cellular  function and responses and the translation of important concepts to the clinic in promising early phase  clinical trials  Co-led by Robert Negrin, MD and Edgar Engleman, MD, the 32 members of the program represent nine  departments in the School of Medicine. Program members are major participants in one NCI P01, a number  of NCI R01s, R21 and R33 and a NIH T32. Peer-reviewed funding is represented by a total of $12.2M in  total costs/year of which $2.4M is from the NCI, $5.5M from other NIH Institutes, and $4.4M from other  peer-reviewed sources. During the past five years, over 300 papers have been published, of which 22% are  intra-programmatic and 32% inter-programmatic. Many of these manuscripts reflect external collaborations.  Future aims include the use of new technologies to analyze the immune responses to tumors and the  development of novel cellular therapeutic and other immunological interventions including CD8+ memory T  cells, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, CAR T cells and other genetically engineered cellular and biological  therapies."
"9213764","Abstract Synaptic integration and calcium signaling are two of the most fundamental functions of neurons. Although models emphasizing the passive spread of potentials dominated early thinking we now know that there are many channel types and signaling molecules distributed over the dendritic arborization that contribute to the amplification of potentials and the activation of regenerative events in different dendritic regions and under different conditions. Exactly how these events are generated and interact is incompletely understood. Several postsynaptic mechanisms appear to particularly important since they are localized in specific dendritic regions and generate large calcium concentration changes. These include NMDA spikes, calcium waves, and localized spine calcium signals. We will use a recently developed a method to simultaneously image sodium and calcium changes in dendrites with high sensitivity and good spatial and temporal resolution. With this technique, combined with classic hippocampal slice electrophysiology and focal glutamate uncaging we will examine the properties of these events. We will explore the heterogeneous generation and propagation of NMDA spikes and calcium release events, determining their spatial boundaries and how they interact to synergistically amplify potentials and generate calcium signals. We will extend these measurements to an examination of some properties of dendritic spines, including the role of voltage dependent sodium channels, spine neck resistance, and the relative contribution of AMPA and NMDA receptor channels on individual spines. Knowledge of these properties is important for both an understanding of basic brain function and for elucidation of how their dysfunction might impact disease processes."
"9291695","Project Summary/Abstract Neuroinflammation can occur as a consequence of neurotropic viral infection, brain tumor, traumatic brain injury, or autoimmunity, and the prognoses pursuant to these events are often poor. Despite the prevalence of diseases in which neuroinflammation may be a key component of damage, little is known about how cytokines, including interferons (IFNs), affect neuronal physiology. Moreover, virtually nothing is known about the IFN response in distinct neuronal sub-populations (based on either location or function). In preliminary studies, we showed that primary hippocampal neurons express less of the key IFN signal transducer, STAT1, than do non-neuronal cells, including primary fibroblasts and astrocytes. In fact, while interferon-gamma (IFN?) is necessary for protection from an otherwise lethal neurotropic measles virus infection, STAT1 is not required for mouse survival or viral clearance. These data, the first to decouple STAT1 from IFN? signaling, imply that alternative signaling pathways are utilized in neurons. Our recent work indicates that other signal transducers are disproportionately induced in neurons, which we speculate results in the activation of a pro-survival program that braces the neuron from neuroinflammatory cytotoxicity. This proposal pursues two complementary aims to test the hypothesis that cell- intrinsic differences in the expression levels of signal transducers can diversify the cellular response to a given cytokine ligand. Our objective is to characterize the IFN? signaling pathways in neurons, to show how use of alternative (non-STAT1-mediated) pathways affects viral clearance and neuronal biology, and to identify how differences in neuronal subtype may contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of inflammation in the brain. Ultimately, these studies will provide a foundation upon which to build rational strategies to prevent or treat life-threatening brain disorders."
"9272153","Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (SVD) is an important, potentially modifiable factor for clinical dementia. Recent data suggest that the age-specific incidence of dementia may be decreasing, partly as a result of better management of vascular risk factors, lending urgency to dementia prevention trials but a major impediment is the absence of circulating biomarkers for tracking onset and progression of SVD. Brain MRI imaging markers are the current gold standard for SVD but are too expensive and burdensome for repeated assessments. Recent genetic studies, including from the Cohorts for Heart & Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, implicate microglial inflammation and astroglia in the biology of SVD and dementia. We propose to measure 2 circulating biomarkers of microglial inflammation (sCD-14 and YKL-40) and a marker of astroglial injury (GFAP) in ~17,000 persons (including 4000 minority participants, 6000 with >2 MRI) across 5 CHARGE population-based cohorts.  Specifcally, we will (1) examine the association of the novel biomarkers with (a) previously collected MRI-defined SVD (white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds), and in persons under age 70, sensitive MRI measures of early, preclinical SVD such as fractional anisotropy on diffusion- weighted imaging, regional cortical thinning and perivascular spaces; (b) previously collected measures of cognitive function; and (c) neurocognitive and vascular consequences of SVD (dementia and stroke). We will use a Mendelian Randomization framework and existing genetic data to examine causal relationships between the novel biomarkers and MRI, neurocognitive, and clinical outcomes.  (2) We will assess the incremental predictive utility of the novel biomarkers over (a) vascular risk factor profiles such as the Framingham Stroke Risk Prediction score; (b) over a panel of previously measured `candidate' biomarkers for SVD including CRP, IL6, TNF-alpha, fibrinogen, BNP, urine albumin, tHcy, ST2, GDF15, TnI, BDNF, VEGF, MMP-9, beta-amyloid, clusterin and APOE and (c) we will identify a parsimonious set of biomarkers that best predict presence of SVD and risk of cognitive decline, stroke and dementia.  (3) We will (a) validate the prediction models developed in Aim 2 in independent samples, (b) extend the biological associations and improve clinical prediction models through hypothesis-free exploration of multi-dimensional omics (whole genome, GWAS, epigenetic and gene expression) and (c) investigate the added predictive value of risk models that combine genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic information over models that consider only risk factor and serum biomarker information. In summary we propose to leverage extensive available data to identify and validate a novel circulating biomarker profile of glial cell dysfunction that will improve our understanding of SVD biology and help in the prediction of SVD and its associated adverse neurological outcomes.  "
"9135879","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ulcerative keratitis caused by infectious microbes (bacteria, fungi, amoebae and viruses) represents a major area of medical concern. It is one of the most important causes of corneal opacifications, which is the second common cause of legal blindness world-wide after cataracts. In 2010, in the USA alone, 76.5% of the approximately 930,000 doctor's office and outpatient clinic and 58,000 emergency department visits related to ocular distress and emergencies, resulted in antibiotic prescriptions for microbil keratitis. The total annual financial burden on our healthcare system for keratitis cases was estimated to be $175 million in direct health care expenditures in 2010 and was also estimated to consume over 250,000 annual hours of clinician time. Bacterial keratitis manifests as corneal ulcer, corneal edema and/or hypopyon and can cause significant complications including corneal perforation, corneal thinning, elevated intraocular pressure and progression to endophthalmitis. This could lead to severe clinical outcomes including partial or complete vision loss, necessity for penetrating keratoplasty, corneal grafts, enucleation and evisceration. Although topical and systemic antibiotics are effective in reducing microbial loads in keratitis cases (unless the microbe is resistant to the antibiotic utilized), the time required to resolve th infection is generally quite lengthy. Furthermore, antibiotics are typically ineffective in reducin inflammation and evoking regenerative repair of corneal and/or scleral defects and scarring which may be induced by the infection. Lynntech, Inc. in collaboration with the University of Mississippi Medical Center proposes to develop an innovative, inexpensive and compact device, termed iCAP to effectively treat microbial keratitis at the point-of-diagnosis. This device  will be engineered to rapidly and reagentlessly significantly reduce or totally eliminate bacterial  loads regardless of antimicrobial susceptibility status of the infecting microbial species. Furthermore, iCAP has the potential to simultaneously trigger certain cellular signaling pathways which could result in improved regeneration of corneal and scleral defects induced by the infection. During this Phase I SBIR effort, our specific aims are to (1) design and fabricate prototype iCAP devices, (2) utilize in vitro microbial and mammalian cell culture techniques to obtain pilot ranges of iCAP device operating parameters likely to be effective in vivo and (3) demonstrate that iCAP can significantly reduce or eliminate bacterial loads and orchestrate healing of infection induced corneal/scleral defects in a relevant in vivo rabbit eye model of bacterial keratitis. The successful completion of these specific aims should demonstrate ample feasibility of this innovative new microbial keratitis treatment approach, and will enable us to execute more comprehensive technology development and commercialization thrusts in a future follow-on Phase II effort. The eventual commercial availability of iCAP devices is likely to sustai high positive impact for the patient populace suffering from microbial keratitis."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our UCLA team in partnership with United Healthcare (UHC) proposes to form a cooperative agreement with the CDC and NIDDK to evaluate the impact of two highly innovative programs in Medicaid known as the Accountable Care Communities (ACC) Program and the Health Home (HH) Program. Both programs are delivery system transformations with on-the-ground partnerships to support improvements in care and population management strategies for Medicaid beneficiaries, many of whom have diabetes and other complex care needs. The implementation of the ACC and HH programs by one of the nation's largest for-profit insurance companies who has over 1 million new Medicaid enrollees since 2012, represents a unique and very timely evaluation of real-world interventions. The overall goal of the research is to employ rigorous empirical evaluation of the impact of these innovative programs on the delivery, outcomes, and cost of care for adult Medicaid enrollees with diabetes. Our specific aims are as follows: 1) To evaluate whether the Medicaid ACC Program which provides on-the-ground partnerships that embed  UHC transformation consultants and nurses into practices to support improvements in care, provides  access to complete health care and community wide data analytics to support population management and  includes practice level financial incentives, such as shared savings programs, will lead to improvements in  adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c control, fewer emergency  room visits and hospitalizations and lower overall costs of care. 2) To evaluate whether the Medicaid HH Program which targets patients with serious chronic physical and  mental health conditions who also have high social needs, and high costs of care, and provides them  intensive, individualized care management from an integrated team inclusive of community health workers  will lead to improvement in adherence to medications and diabetes processes of care, in A1c and LDL-c  control, fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations and lower overall costs of care. 3) To fully participate in a collaborative multi-institution netwok designed to strengthen the research methods  for evaluating natural experiments across all sites, and to advance the best analytic methods for natural  experiments in the US research community Our UCLA team will use quasi-experimental designs, de-identified data from UHC, and state-of-the-art modeling strategies to achieve these aims. Our team's 11 years of highly productive partnership with UHC, 19 years of experience evaluating policy-relevant natural experiments, most recently in the NEXT-D study, and 12 years of leading study coordination across national collaboratives, will help ensure our success."
"9234945","PROJECT SUMMARY Although much research has been conducted on the impact of the electronic health record (EHR) and health information technology (HIT) on provider-patient interaction, challenges persist on how to effectively integrate these tools into healthcare environments, while maintaining patient-centered care. We propose a multi-method study to investigate and improve the exam room and computing layout to improve clinical workflow and patient-centeredness, which may ultimately enhance patient safety, in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Prototype and evaluate a redesigned exam room layout with respect to the exam room computing and compare the redesigned layout to a current, typical exam room layout in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Aim 2: Refine the redesigned exam room layout, implement it in a live clinic setting, and compare it to currently designed exam rooms in a Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. To achieve Aim 1, we propose a ?human in the loop? simulation study in the Center for Ergonomics laboratory space at the University of Louisville to pilot test a redesigned exam room layout with respect to the exam room computing. In the proposed simulation study, improved system design can be demonstrated through measures of efficiency, accuracy, workload, patient-centeredness, time spent screen sharing, workflow integration, and situation awareness. Each of these measures will be used to compare a current, typical exam room layout with the redesigned layout in a simulated setting. To achieve Aim 2, we propose a pilot implementation based upon actual patient visits in a live clinic. We will collect measures of patient-centeredness, screen sharing, workflow integration, and situation awareness in both the redesigned exam room and current exam rooms to understand the impact of the redesigned exam room layout. The intention of the live clinic study is to gather additional field data to support the findings from the laboratory simulation study, and ultimately to have confidence our intervention for a larger study that would support broad dissemination of the redesigned exam room layout VHA-wide. Through these aims, we will refine and finalize a new exam room design for the VHA grounded in a sociotechnical systems perspective. We expect the knowledge generated by this study will be generalizable across different healthcare organizations for enhancing patient-centeredness with regard to exam room computing."
"9260198","The Neurobiology of Disease Workshop (NDW) provides basic scientists and trainees with an in-depth introduction to neurological disorders. It is organized as a day-long workshop held the Friday before the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Meeting. The overall goal of the Workshop is to introduce the world of neurological disease to the basic scientist, with the expectation that whatever their interest or expertise in the nervous system, they may bring extraordinary new questions, ideas and even solutions to problems in the field. Reflecting the dynamic and rapidly advancing state of neuroscience research, the topic of each NDW is identified only one year in advance. Although the specific topics change each year, the Workshop?s agenda format remains consistent. The core of the Workshop begins with a patient presentation. Growing less common in clinical departments, and certainly unique to a basic science workshop, is the patient presentation that begins the day-long NDW program. This is a live interview performed by an experienced clinician in front of the entire audience. Not only are patients presented, but in applicable cases, family members of the patient also attend the Workshop. Often the family members are asked to describe how the disease has affected their own lives, helping neuroscientists in training see the human side of diseases of the nervous system. The patient presentation is followed by multiple lectures that cover the essential clinical and basic science information necessary to understand the disease or disorder. The set of lectures includes neuropathology (where relevant), the anatomy of the systems involved, neurochemical and physiological correlates, current treatments, and other related information. The faculty members, chosen for their expertise in the field, present the core information, which lasts approximately three to four hours. As detailed above, a patient is presented by a senior clinician early in the Workshop schedule, and time is allotted for the audience to ask questions of the patient or the clinician. Following the patient and core lecture presentations, Workshop participants form breakout groups, each led by a team of two faculty members, for a period of extended discussions. The total time for each discussion group is 1.5 hours and these sessions are designed to stimulate participant thinking and speculation about the disease and to inform them of the research already underway."

"9234763","Project Summary `Degeneracy' in network function has been observed in a number of species. In these situations one particular pattern of motor activity is encoded by more than one set of cellular and synaptic properties. A question of general interest is: how does this impact network function? Experiments proposed in this application will study degeneracy in a multi-tasking network in the context of `task' switching, i.e., the cessation of one type of motor program and the initiation of another. We will test a novel hypothesis that postulates that the ability to `task' switch is determined by the nature of the mechanisms that are used to pattern activity. In particular, we suggest that this is likely to be the case in a commonly observed situation, i.e., in the situation where modulatory neurotransmitters play an important role in configuring neural activity. Effects of modulatory transmitters generally persist, which creates a form of implicit memory. We suggest that this implicit memory can either impede or promote task switching. In more specific terms, our experiments are conducted in an experimentally advantageous network that mediates feeding related behaviors. Our experiments take advantage of considerable preliminary data that indicate that egestive patterns of motor activity can be induced in this network in at least two ways, i.e., they are encoded as two distinct sets of cellular and synaptic properties. Proposed experiments will determine whether this is the case, and will contrast transitions to ingestive activity from the two types of egestive configurations. We suggest that in one situation the network will be able to change the nature of the motor program relatively quickly, whereas in the other situation it will not. We will determine why this is the case in experiments that will analyze underlying mechanisms at both the circuit and cellular/molecular level. Switches in network activity are important for the survival of most species. In humans, costs associated with task switching can significantly impact performance. Nevertheless cellular and molecular mechanisms that facilitate or impede task switching have not been described. To our knowledge we are the only group working in a tractable model system that is studying this phenomenon at a cellular/molecular level."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are blinding diseases caused by the degeneration of rods and cones, leaving the rest of the visual system intact but unable to respond to light. A synthetic chemical photoswitch, named DENAQ, can restore visual responses in blind mouse models of RP. Previous studies showed that DENAQ imparts light-sensitivity on action potential firing in retinal ganglion cells (RGC), but how this occurs is unclear. The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism of DENAQ photosensitization, crucial for enabling discovery of improved drug candidates and for optimizing photo- stimulation strategies for vision restoration. The first aim i to understand why DENAQ selectively photosensitizes retinas from mice with dead rods and cones while having no effect on healthy retinas with intact rods and cones. We will test the hypothesis that degeneration leads to enhanced entry of DENAQ into RGCs and/or enhanced action on ion channels underlying spontaneous firing in RGCs. The second aim is to identify which RGCs are photosensitized by DENAQ. In the healthy retina, some RGCs fire at light onset, some at offset, and some at onset and offset. Studies will determine which are photosensitized by DENAQ, and whether local degeneration of rods and cones leads to spatially constrained RGC photosensitization, of particular relevance for AMD, a localized degenerative disease. Other studies will reveal whether DENAQ photosensitization applies to human RGCs in tissue samples obtained during surgical retinectomy. The third aim is to exploit our findings to optimize vision restoration. Information about the ion channels targeted by DENAQ will enable development of more specific photoswitches. Subcellular localization of these channels in RGCs will enable more spatially-precise photo-control. Finally imaging studies in vivo will reveal signals transmitted from the DENAQ-treated retina to the brain of blind mice, validating the functional integrity of the visual system and providing a platform for optimizing retinal stimulatin patterns to best recapitulate normal visual responses."
"9253689","Project Summary   Modern genetic studies have been conducted predominantly in cohorts of individuals of European ancestry. By 2010, there were approximately ten times as many published genome wide association studies (GWAS) in people of European ancestry than studies in people of all other ancestries combined. This research disparity has led to an uneven understanding of the genetic basis underlying disease in Europeans and non-Europeans. 23andMe's web-based, large scale research model is ideal for scaling genetics research within non-European populations and thereby bringing more parity to genetics research. Our database is composed of genotypes and phenotypes of over 1,000,000 consenting customers, including over 200,000 individuals with non-European ancestry. The data derived from non-European individuals represent a particularly valuable resource for genetic discovery of novel variants that may not be found in the European population. However, research studies in non-European populations are weakened by the lack of availability of large-scale reference datasets and, in particular, genotype imputation panels. Genotype imputation is a statistical methodology that uses observations of genotypes in a large reference panel to infer unobserved genotypes in a target dataset. This methodology is widely used within GWAS, and allows novel genetic associations to be identified and refined. Due to this utility, very large reference panels have been constructed, containing thousands or tens of thousands of whole genome sequences. Unfortunately, the largest imputation panels are composed of predominantly European genomes, reflecting the modern bias towards European studies in GWAS. This proposal aims to address this imbalance by constructing an imputation panel specifically for the African American population. In doing so, we will expand 23andMe?s ability to perform genetic discovery in non-European populations, and improve the understanding of global genetic variation underlying diseases and traits. Key commercial outcomes of the research include the identification of novel genetic targets for internal and external therapeutic development. The long-term aim is to improve understanding of disease in minority populations, which we hope may eventually lead to improved treatments of disease in these historically medically understudied groups.    "
"9171847","Single molecule sequencing of full-length RNA will provide a technology platform for analysis of transcripts with low copy numbers in a single cell. Two methods for doing this have been demonstrated: In the first one (Pacific Biosciences), full-length RNA is first converted to complementary DNA and then sequenced via single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing, in which single-molecule optics is used to monitor the addition of nucleotides during DNA synthesis. The second approach is ion-current sensing of translocation in a protein nanopore (the MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies). SMRT sequencing has high capital and reagent costs, factors that have limited its deployment. Ion-current based nanopore sensing is low-cost and convenient but limited to sensing five bases at a time. This complicates reads of modified bases and homopolymer tracts. Electron tunneling has the ability to read one base at a time, but the required electrode gaps are too small to pass an RNA molecule. We have developed Recognition Tunneling (RT) using small recognition molecules (RMs) that are chemically attached to electrodes. RT extends the tunneling range, so that larger (2.5 nm) electrode gaps can be used, and specific interactions with the RMs improve the readout accuracy. Using RT we are able to read through homopolymer tracts and recognize modified bases directly, offering a path to a substantial advance beyond existing approaches. Solid-state RT chips have been demonstrated and the first signals from translocating oligomers have been obtained (using devices with fairly large pores). A better control of translocation and unwinding of folded RNA molecules are now the key requirements for successful implementation of RT sequencing (as was the case with ion-current protein pores prior to 2012). Here, we propose to implement a hybrid pore comprised of a poliovirus RNA polymerase trapped in a solid-state pore. In Aim 1 we will develop a scalable process to make solid-state devices with smaller pores (< 5nm). We are partnering with Norcada, a manufacturer of MEMs devices, for production engineering. In Aim 2 we will develop protocols to trap the polymerase-RNA complex, and pull the RNA through the solid-state pore, using the polymerase tunnel to linearize the RNA and pass a single strand into the solid-state pore one base at a time. In Aim 3 we will develop the device and on-chip electronics so as to lay the groundwork for large-scale manufacture of arrays of devices that operate in parallel and at high speed. Our team has unique strengths and consists of Stuart Lindsay and Peiming Zhang (Arizona State University) who will build devices and integrate the work of the team; Meni Wanunu (North Eastern University) and Ya-Ming Hou (Thomas Jefferson University) who will build and characterize hybrid solid-state-protein pores; Adam Hall (Wake Forest University) who will develop reliable (and scalable) methods of fabricating small pores and Jacob Rosenstein (Brown) who will design RT chips with enhanced performance, including on-chip signal processing."
"8999530","PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 3)  Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains an incurable disease for which novel  molecular mechanism-based combination therapy strategies are needed. We identified an androgen receptor  (AR)- and c-Myb?co-regulated DNA damage response (DDR) gene signature that is highly correlated with  castration-resistance, metastasis, and reduced overall survival in mCRPC patients. In this DDR gene signature  homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair genes and HR modulator (HRM) genes are highly represented.  The relatively large percentage of HR/HRM genes in the DDR gene signature underscores the importance of  this group of genes to prostate cancer progression. Our preliminary preclinical studies demonstrated that  enzalutamide (ENZ), a 2nd-generation anti-androgen that blocks androgen from binding to the androgen  receptor (AR), suppressed the expression of a majority of the HR/HRM genes and synergized with olaparib  (OLA), a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor in suppressing prostate cancer growth. Previously,  OLA has been associated with synthetic lethality in multiple malignancies with BRCA1/2 or other HR gene  deficiencies and its target, PARP1, plays a crucial role in base excision repair (BER) and was reported to  function as an AR co-factor. In this project, we propose to test the hypothesis that targeting AR (ENZ) and  PARP (OLA) in a ?lead-in? strategy will generate synthetic lethality in mCRPC through ENZ-mediated  downregulation of HR/HRM gene activity and OLA-mediated suppression of PARP?s enzymatic activity  in BER and PARP?s cofactor role of AR transcriptional activity. The lead-in trial design will allow us to  efficiently determine the clinical relevance of our biological findings by linking baseline to sequential  modulation of target genes in individual cancers. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims.  Aim 1. Characterize the HR/HRM gene signature in bone marrow biopsies of men with mCRPC treated with   enzalutamide and/or abiraterone, novel inhibitors of androgen signaling.  Aim 2. Further characterize the synergistic potential of and identify predictive biomarkers of response to   combination therapies that co-target AR (ENZ) and PARP function (OLA) using preclinical models.  Aim 3. Conduct a clinical trial of treating CRPC patients with ENZ followed by the addition of the PARP   inhibitor OLA to achieve greater therapeutic response and to correlate an ENZ-regulated HR/HRM   gene signature to the therapeutic responses."
"9147604","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been becoming increasingly evident that in utero exposure of mammalian fetuses to environmental endocrine disruptors may cause transgenerational diseases through disruption of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression. The disease phenotypes of the F2 and later generations may resemble each other because such phenotypes might be derived from a common set of germline-transmitted epimutations. In contrast, the F1 phenotype is not derived from the germline epimutations; therefore, it does not need to be similar to phenotypes of the F2+ generations. However, many animal studies have reported remarkably similar phenotypes of the F1 and the F2+ generations. To explain this somewhat paradoxical phenomenon, we hypothesize that the nuclear receptors expressed in both the somatic cells and the germline cells may be responsible for the phenotypes commonly observed in the F1 and the F2+ generations but through distinct mechanisms. Specifically, while nuclear receptors expressed in the somatic cells may directly affect transcription of the hormone target genes to provoke the F1 phenotypes, in the germline cells the same nuclear receptors might cause epimutations at the same set of genes to cause the F2+ phenotypes. To obtain experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis, our Specific Aim 1 aims to determine whether fetal exposure of mice to endocrine disruptors known to cause transgenerational obesity introduces specific epigenetic changes at the binding sequences of the affected nuclear receptors in the genome of the germline cells. Pregnant female transgenic mice engineered for germline-specific GFP expression will be exposed to tributyltin, rosiglitazone, or Bisphenol A from 12.5 dpc until 18.5 dpc, and the GFP+ germline cells will be collected from their fetuses by FACS. Genome-wide profiling of mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and nuclear hormone receptor binding in the genome of the F1 germline cells will be determined by deep sequencing (RNA- seq, Bisulfite-seq, and ChIP-seq). To identify the transgenerationally transmittable germline epimutations, we will also determine transcriptomes and epigenetic mark distributions in the GFP+ germline cells of F2 and F3 fetuses at 18.5 dpc. To evaluate the transgenerational obesity phenotype and the germline-conveyed epimutations, we will examine fat depot weight, adipocyte size, and adipocyte number of brown and white adipose tissues in 8-weeks-old F1, F2, and F3 pups. Selected adipose tissue specimens will also be subjected to transcriptomal and epigenomic analyses. Our Specific Aim 2 aims to determine whether exposure of mouse and human primordial germ cell-like cells (PGC-LCs) to the obesogenic endocrine disruptors causes specific epigenetic changes at the nuclear receptor binding sequences to affect cellular sensitivity to the relevant hormonal agents in vitro. We will determine transcriptomes, epigenomic mark distributions, and genome-wide ligand sensitivity profiles of the hormone responsive genes using deep sequencing. RNAi knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout experiments will establish the requirement of each nuclear receptor and the Tet family DNA hydroxymethyltransferases in formation of the exposure-induced epimutations. Successful completion of this project will establish a novel theoretical and methodological foundation, including in vivo and in vitro model systems, for future research on the molecular mechanisms of transgenerational diseases caused by fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors."
"9158069","ABSTRACT A substantial number of critically ill patients experience persistent organ failure leading to chronic critical illness (CCI). The majority of these patients die within a year, and many survivors must cope with long-term physical and cognitive limitations that are often severe. Survival with severe physical and cognitive dysfunction is a significant clinical, emotional, and economic burden in this population, but little is known about which patients are at highest risk for physical and cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, although long-term mortality in CCI can be reliably estimated with a validated mortality prediction model, there is currently no validated method to predict long-term functional disability for purposes of shared decision making and resource planning. In order to address these gaps in knowledge, we will conduct the first multicenter prospective cohort study that measures risk factors for long-term physical and cognitive dysfunction in CCI. Using these risk factors, we will construct a useful and innovative multi-outcome prognostic model to facilitate shared decision making and resource planning. Specific aims for the project are as follows:  1. Identify risk factors for long-term physical and cognitive dysfunction for patients with CCI.  2. Develop and validate an innovative multi-dimensional clinical prediction model to predict the combined  outcome of long-term survival and physical and cognitive function in patients with CCI. We will accomplish these aims by prospectively enrolling 800 patients from 5 diverse medical centers who have required 7 days of mechanical ventilation after acute illness or injury, and we will follow them for up to 1 year. On day 7 of mechanical ventilation we will collect data on lung function, neuromuscular weakness, acute brain dysfunction, and other selected clinically available biomarkers. Premorbid functional decline including validated frailty indices, and social and environmental variables will be obtained from medical records and family interviews. For the first aim these variables will be evaluated as independent risk factors for severe physical and cognitive dysfunction at one-year, focusing first on clinical variables and then on social and economic factors. For the second aim we will construct and validate a single multi-outcome model using a single set of variables to predict survival with severe physical disability, survival with severe cognitive disability, survival with physical and cognitive disability, survival with normal function, and death. This project is important because it will directly provide new tools for patients and clinicians to understand CCI, informing bedside decision making and future medical and resource interventions for this extremely high-risk patient group."
"9245465","Optimal Vitamin D Status as a Strategy to Rescue Cognitive Aging NIA PA-13-303 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Because the numbers of older adults are increasing dramatically, there is an urgent need to identify interventions that may alleviate the personal/socioeconomic burdens associated with age-related memory impairment. One such potential intervention is treatment with vitamin D. Lower serum vitamin D levels are linked to several age- related disorders including cognitive decline and aging individuals are especially susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. For these reasons and because we previously found that vitamin D can reduce several neurophysiological markers of brain aging, we recently undertook a major vitamin D intervention study in male rats. For 6 months, we fed aging male rats different amounts of vitamin D in an attempt to model serum levels of vitamin D found in humans, ranging from deficient to sufficient. We found that rats with higher serum levels of vitamin D, considered in the ?optimal? range for humans, had superior long term memory, outperforming rats with lower vitamin D on a complex memory task (spatial reversal in the water maze). Additional electrophysiological and gene expression analyses showed that hippocampal synaptic function and multiple synaptic markers were altered with higher serum levels of vitamin D, including gene expression for Nr4a2, an immediate early gene and transcription factor that appears to selectively promote long-term memory. Interestingly, our preliminary results from a separate study show that Nr4a2 is expressed in a sex-dependent manner in the hippocampus.  Because women are more than twice as likely to be vitamin D deficient and because the consequences of cognitive aging are greater in women, our goal is to determine whether vitamin D intervention in aging females can offset cognitive decline as it does in males. Therefore, in Aim 1 we directly compare mid-aged male and female F344 rats, treated with diets containing standard or higher vitamin D3, to test the hypothesis that higher serum levels of vitamin D will prevent declining memory function in females as in males. This Aim uses a systems-level approach that includes behavioral testing of multiple forms of memory in the Morris water maze and molecular analyses (gene expression microarrays and immunohistochemistry) to assess processes pertaining to memory. Aim 2 compares males and females on the high vitamin D3 diet to test the novel hypothesis that Nr4a2 is necessary for the cognition enhancing effects of vitamin D. F344 rats will receive intra- hippocampal injections of a viral vector containing shNr4a2 to knockdown Nr4a2 activity. Outcome measures will be the same as in Aim 1. This proposal builds on recent NIH initiatives to investigate sex as a relevant biological variable in order to appropriately tailor therapies/interventions. As the F344 rat is a relevant model of human aging for both sexes, our results also will provide pertinent mechanistic information regarding vitamin D action in the brain. Further, studies on Nr4a2, which selectively promotes long-term memory and appears to be both vitamin D- and sex-dependent, stand to significantly move the field of cognitive aging forward."
"9301172","SUMMARY Since the times of Sir William Bayliss and Ernest Starling at the turn of the 20th century, the gut and the brain were thought to exchange sensory information only indirectly, through hormones. Using modern molecular tools, we recently uncovered a gut neuroepithelial circuit?analogous to that of taste cells in the tongue? formed by the innervation of sensory enteroendocrine cells. This peripheral neural circuit raise the possibility of understanding visceral hypersensitivity at the cellular level?a core symptom of several human disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, chronic abdominal pain, and eating disorders. Enteroendocrine cells receive sensory stimuli from nutrients and bacteria in the gut lumen and respond by firing action potentials. Thus, this neuroepithelial suggests a path for gut sensory signals to modulate brain function and a receptacle for the brain to modulate gastrointestinal sensitivity. We formed an interdisciplinary team, with expertise in gut sensory neurobiology, biomedical engineering, and clinical gastroenterology, to define the brain-to-gut efferent function of this neuroepithelial circuit by taking advantage of newly developed animal models and in vivo technology. The focus on gastrointestinal chemosensory signaling has been afferent gut-to-brain pathways but the brain-to- gut efferent paths that modulate gastrointestinal sensitivity have been poorly described at best. In this Limited Competition - SPARC OT2 proposal, we focus on the efferent portion to produce foundational knowledge for future comprehensive mapping studies. We will pursue the following aims: 1. To map the vagal innervation of enteroendocrine cells in the small intestine. 2. To define the vagal modulation of the neuroepithelial circuit in vivo. 3. To define the function of the neuroepithelial circuit on gastric pressure, intestinal motility, and enteric neural function. By functionally mapping it, we envision developing a platform for future neuromodulation and dietary therapies to alleviate disorders of visceral sensory dysfunction."
"9355304","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Nearly 200 million people in the world, including ~57 million in Bangladesh and ~17 million in the United States (US), are chronically exposed to inorganic arsenic (As), a class I human carcinogen, and are at increased risk of mortality, cancers as well as cardiovascular, pulmonary and other non-malignant disorders.  As part of the Columbia University SRP, we established the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS)?a large prospective cohort study based on individual-level data among a population exposed to a wide range of inorganic As from drinking water in Araihazar, Bangladesh. Over the past 12 years, using a population-based sampling frame, we recruited >24,000 men and women (with >95% response rates) and collected detailed questionnaires, clinical data, and biospecimen samples at baseline recruitment as well as every two years subsequently. Approximately 80% of participants are exposed to water As at low-to moderate doses (0-150 pg/L) with nearly 75% exposed at <100 pg/L. Through a dedicated medical clinic established by Columbia University and The University of Chicago that exclusively serves the HEALS participants, we have also developed an effective mechanism of following the cohort, especially for detecting incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular disorders. In this proposal, with up to 17 years follow-up, we propose to prospectively evaluate the effects of various measures of As exposure and methylation capacity on: i) all-cause, chronic-disease and cancer-related mortalities; ii) incidence of total and subtypes of chronic non-malignant respiratory disease (CNRD) including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, and pulmonary tuberculosis; iii) incidence of total and subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD)  including coronary heart disease and stroke and also CVD subclinical marker carotid artery intima-medial thickness; and, finally to identify iv) modifiable host factors that influence these associations. A combination of prospective study designs including cohort and efficient case-cohort studies will be employed to address these specific aims in the most efficient manner. In addition to investigating these novel research questions, as in the previous funding period, the HEALS cohort will continue to support other biomedical research."
"9146650","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell fate specification is imposed by transcriptional regulators that activate cell type specific gene expression patterns. Many of these master regulators are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, making the Drosophila eye an excellent model system in which to address this process. This proposal will investigate the Drosophila zinc finger transcription factor Glass (Gl), which appears to act as a key determinant in controlling the developmental switch from neuronal precursors to photoreceptor cell types. In gl mutants, eye progenitor cells initiate neuronal differentiation as detected by the presence of neuronal markers, but fail to express photoreceptor-specific genes, extend axons aberrantly into the brain, and die before reaching adulthood. We hypothesize that characterizing the role of Gl in photoreceptor differentiation will reveal novel molecular features underlying eye development. These findings will have translational implications in developing stem cell-based therapies for patients suffering from retinal degenerative diseases. The first aim is to identify the specific stages of photoreceptor development that require Gl function. Premature cell death has prevented a careful analysis of this requirement and it is presently not known if Gl is required at later stages for the differentiation and maintenance of photoreceptors or if its only role is to ac as an early determinant that activates the photoreceptor transcriptional network. To address this question we will inactivate gl expression at late stages, and examine the fate of cells incapable of inducing cell death in a gl mutant background. The second aim will determine if Gl is sufficient to induce photoreceptor development in Drosophila or mammalian cells. Using genetic tools we will misexpress Gl in fly tissues and determine by phenotypic analysis, immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling if it can induce photoreceptor-specific genes or traits. Gl was shown to bind to vertebrate rhodopsin promoters making it a potentially powerful tool with which to induce gene expression changes in mammalian cells. Gl shares homology with an uncharacterized human zinc finger protein ZNF500, which is also highly expressed in the retina. We propose to misexpress Gl or ZNF500 together with neuronal inducers in mouse embryonic stem cells to determine whether it can activate the expression of photoreceptor-specific genes. In the third aim we will use an RNAi strategy to investigate the role of each of the identified direct targets of Gl activation in photoreceptor development. As many of these genes remain uncharacterized, we expect to identify novel factors that contribute to photoreceptor recruitment, differentiation, survival or axon targeting."
"9268135","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding communication between neurons, who is talking to whom, and what language they are speaking, is essential for discovering how brain circuits underlie brain function and dysfunction. Over the past decades, Neuroscience has made exponential progress toward recording and imaging communication between neurons. In addition, geneticists have recently developed the capability to manipulate neurons with light through the expression of light-activated microbial proteins called opsins. Now, neuroscientists can drive neural circuits in order to determine how they give rise to sensation, perception, and cognitive function. In order to take full advantage of optogenetic tools, we are developing holographic methods to deliver patterned light into brain tissue, to enable simultaneous activation of multiple neurons, independently controlling the strength and timing of light targeted to each cell. Here, we propose to: (1) characterize newly developed opsins to determine which are best suited for holographic activation techniques; (2) implement holographic light patterns in three-dimensions; and, (3) distribute and iteratively optimize the 3D holography system in collaboration with Neuroscientists studying circuits in optically and physiologically diverse neura systems. The end goal is to develop a robust system, capable of manipulating neurons in patterns that mimic naturally occurring activity. Insights gained through this collaborative optimization will be used to inform the design of the commercial prototype developed by our industry collaborator Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc. (Denver, CO). The system can thus be widely distributed for neural circuit investigation, both in-vitro and in-vivo, to discover how neual communication gives rise to sensation, perception, cognition, and behavior. Such insights will improve our ability to identify effective targets and methods for treating neurological diseases and disorders."
"9181244","PROJECT SUMMARY Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), a unique synaptic site where spinal motor neurons (MNs) meet myofibers to form a functional motor unit (MU), consist of three major components, MN?s pre-synapse, myofiber?s post- synapse, and terminal Schwann cells (SCs). Increasing attention has recently been paid to the etiology of ?NMJ aging? in relationship to sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging. Here, we propose two complementary aims focusing on unraveling NMJ aging mechanisms in relation to sarcopenia: <SA-1> Identifying the earliest sarcopenia-associated molecular changes and potential biomarkers at aging NMJs in vivo - We will perform, for the first time, RNAseq of micro-dissected NMJs, isolated at different time points from aging mice, using a laser-capture micro-dissection (LCM) technique. A series of established bioinformatics analyses will be then run to extract candidate molecules followed by identification of their cellular origins. To obtain high-quality RNA in the LCM, we will apply our original technique, which requires only a few minutes to visualize the NMJ. We will prioritize the validation of therapeutic target candidates previously associated with neuromuscular diseases and biomarker candidates with known ligands or other potential monitoring strategies. <SA-II> Engineering a novel in vitro co-culture system of mature and aging NMJs - We will employ a double-compartmented system recapitulating the physiological separation of the central (MNs and astrocytes [ASTs]) and peripheral (MN axons, myotubes [MTs] and SCs) nervous systems in vivo. The glial cells (ASTs and SCs) will provide the MU with the biologically required structural and trophic support, minimizing the need for culture media supplementation. This strategy is essential for a faithful subsequent modeling of NMJ aging, which is thought to be associated with functional decline of cells constituting the MUs. In addition, we will protect cells in both compartments with fibrin gel scaffoldings to prevent cell detachment and synaptic disconnection due to frequent MT contraction. Furthermore, intermittent electrical stimulation (IES) will be provided to the MUs to facilitate their maturation. Once maturity is achieved, we will terminate the ?muscle exercise effect? of IES and reduce trophic factors to mimic natural aging in humans. NMJ maturity and aging will be monitored at multiple time points for molecular, morphological, and functional changes. Finally, the co-culture system developed will be utilized for screening and determining the properties of the molecules identified in SA-I. <Study impact> Our novel NMJ-LCM with a cutting-edge bioinformatics analysis should generate invaluable data to reveal the pathology and gain potential therapeutic insights into sarcopenia. In addition, our innovative co-culture system could become the first in vitro model to achieve complete maturation and subsequent aging of NMJs and serve as a powerful tool for mechanistic and translational studies of sarcopenia. This work will also contribute to a broader area of neuromuscular research, ranging from basic studies on MUs/NMJs, to more translational works on various other neuromuscular diseases."
"9143756","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication CPOE (Computerized Prescriber Order Entry), currently lacks an essential safety feature-the indication for the prescription. Re-engineering CPOE to incorporate drug indications is vital and likely to markedly improve quality and safety in 6 key areas: medication error prevention and mitigation, facilitating patient education, promoting prescribing drugs-of-choice, enhanced team communication, organizing med lists for medication reconciliation, enabling more meaningful comparative outcomes research. We will bring together key stakeholders with experts in HIT, patient safety, pharmacy practice, HIT knowledge and EMR vendors, and user-centered design to achieve consensus on key issues related to the rationale, feasibility, features, barriers, and risks related to indicatins-based prescribing (I-CPOE). We will create 6 panels to: 1) delineate the construct and experience with I-CPOE, 2) indentify role and approaches of I-CPOE in preventing and recognizing med errors, 3) spell out role and practical logistics for I-CPOE related to pharmacists and pharmacies, 4) develop ways I-CPOE can impact patient education, 5) understand ways to implement drugs-of-choice recommendations into CPOE, and 6) develop strategies for overcoming technical challenges and interface with knowledge and EMR vendors. Using a modified Delphi approach we will achieve consensus on these key strategic and design issues. Based on the findings from this consensus development phase, along with formally collected user requirements, we will build and test a working prototype for an I-CPOE ordering system. This will be accomplished in four phases: creation of user requirements document, participatory design sessions, contextual inquiry sessions, and usability testing with iterative completion of a final high fidelity prototype. We will proceed to test the safety, speed, and satisfaction of this working prototype compared to two well established EMRs (LMR, and Epic). We will also compare the usability and safety of the prescriptions generated from these 3 systems (2 standard vs I-CPOE prototype) from the perspective of pharmacists and patients, examining their assessments of indications-enabled prescriptions and medication lists. Overall, these tests will test the hypothesis that I-CPOE prescribing, prescriptions, and medication lists are safer and superior in key measures of HIT safety, efficiency and satisfaction. Finally we will work with our partnering stakeholders to disseminate our tools, prototype and findings to advance the agenda and development of indications-based prescribing thereby facilitating progress toward this stalled patient safety recommendation and goal. ,"
"9253636","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer?s disease (AD) affects 44 million people worldwide, costing $605 billion yearly. One in nine Americans over the age of 65 have AD, the 6th leading cause of death in the US. Annually, $226 billion is spent to care for the 5.3 million Americans with AD. AD is the only cause of death in the top 10 that cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed, and without the development of treatments for AD, it is expected that by 2050 there will be 16 million Americans with AD, costing $1.1 trillion yearly. Life expectancy following AD diagnosis is only 3-9 years. AD patients suffer from chronic neurodegeneration, gradual loss of bodily functions, and a poor quality of life. Studying patients with early onset AD has elucidated many genes that play a role in AD including the critical role of the Amyloid Precursor Protein gene (hAPP) and the Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau gene (hMAPT). To date, models of AD have been largely developed in mice, and no therapies developed in these models have proven effective in humans, likely due to the large anatomical and physiological variation between human and rodent brains, coupled with the failure of mice to develop the neurodegenerative processes and brain lesions seen in AD patients. Compared to rodents, swine have much greater genetic, anatomic, and physiological similarity to humans, offering an opportunity to model a complex neuropathological disease in a large animal. The large, gyrencephalic brain of the pig is similar in size and structure to humans, and a model of diffuse brain injury in swine shows AD-like pathology with accumulation of amyloid beta (A?? and Tau. We propose to establish a swine model of AD, allowing researchers to understand the biology of AD, enable doctors to establish methods of early detection, and ultimately lead to the identification of new therapies to prevent, halt the progression of, and reverse AD. We will establish this model using our powerful and proprietary genetic engineering techniques to replace swine APP and MAPT genes with human AD-associated alleles of these genes. This will allow us to precisely model human AD in swine, and develop therapeutics that could be pre-clinically tested for safety and efficacy in our swine and moved directly to human clinical trials. We will assess the resulting animals at 2 months of age by magnetic resonance imaging to determine if they have suffered neurodegeneration by whole brain and hippocampal volume measurement, as well as if amyloid plaques have formed, or they display a pattern of abnormal brain metabolite concentrations, consistent with AD patients."

"9196058","Project Summary/Abstract The main objectives of the Metals in the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2M) are to evaluate whether long-term edetate disodium (EDTA)-based chelation infusions can significantly reduce body lead and cadmium levels and to determine whether this effect explains the reduction in major cardiovascular events caused by EDTA chelation therapy. TACT2M is a companion study to TACT2 and will be integrated into the clinical trial platform of TACT2, which will enroll 1200 post-MI patients with diabetes who are at least 50 years old and have a creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. TACT2, a replication study of TACT (referred to as TACT1), will be a 2X2 factorial trial, randomizing patients to 4 groups, defined by both active vs placebo infusions and active vs placebo oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM). NCCIH has funded the UG3 1-year Planning Phase of TACT2. The co-primary endpoints of TACT2M are: 1] the change in blood lead level from baseline to infusion 40 or 1 year, whichever is first, and 2] the change in urine cadmium controlled for creatinine (Cd mcg/ gram creatinine) from baseline to infusion 40 or 1 year, whichever is first. TACT2M has 3 Specific Aims: 1] Compare the change in metal internal dose (blood lead and urine cadmium) in TACT2 participants, from baseline to infusion 40 or 1 year in the active infusion arm; 2] Evaluate whether higher baseline metal internal dose (blood lead and urine cadmium) and the extent of depletion of those stores identifies patients more likely to show benefit from chelation; 3] Collect a biorepository of specimens to support future mechanistic work. Samples of whole blood and urine will be stored at -80ºC in a secured biorepository to ensure their availability for the evaluation of future hypotheses that will be guided by the results of the trial. Moreover, TACT2M represents a unique opportunity to assess the following Exploratory Aims: a] whether post- infusion urine measurements, alone and in comparison to the corresponding pre-infusion measurements, have clinical significance; b] whether OMVM interact with edetate disodium-mediated metal excretion; and c] whether the suite of additional toxic and essential metals measured in blood and urine by the ICPMS analytic technique used by the metals lab, many of which are not chelated by edetate disodium, have clinical significance in preliminary testing. In summary, TACT2M will assess whether metal chelation is a possible mechanism for improved clinical outcomes in post-MI diabetic patients receiving edetate disodium chelation. The integration of TACT2M into the existing TACT2 study is an efficient method to inform the treatment of patients with a history of MI and diabetes."
"9293865","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke afflicts ?2,000 U.S. children every year, permanently disabling most, yet is poorly understood. The Vascular effects of Infection in Pediatric Stroke (VIPS I) study established an international network of 37 sites and enrolled 355 children with stroke and 354 controls. We discovered: (a) minor clinical infections act as a stroke trigger, while routine childhood vaccinations are protective; (b) almost half of children with stroke have an acute herpesvirus infection (the cause of chicken pox, cold sores, and other common illnesses); and (c) children with stroke have a high risk of recurrent stroke, particularly if they have an arteriopathy. A VIPS pilot study suggests that other common childhood pathogens may also play a role, possibly in combination with herpesviruses. The full spectrum of pathogens that contribute to childhood stroke risk remains unknown. Infection is compelling as a treatable stroke risk factor, with available therapies for both pathogens and downstream inflammatory effects. However, VIPS findings present a paradox: infection is common, while childhood stroke is uncommon. Possible explanations are (1) the ?infection hypothesis?: unusual pathogen strains, or combinations of pathogens, lead to stroke; and (2) the ?host response hypothesis?: an unusual inflammatory response to infection leads to stroke.  A thorough understanding of both the specific pathogens and inflammatory mediators underlying childhood stroke pathogenesis, particularly arteriopathic stroke, is needed to develop strategies to reduce recurrent stroke in children. Broad testing for infections through traditional methods is prohibitively costly, and requires preconceived assumptions about the pathogens involved. Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows for the efficient, highly sensitive and unbiased detection of any pathogen, known or novel, by sequencing all nucleic acids in a biological sample and matching them with genomes in a reference database. Multiplex bead arrays can efficiently test for a large number of immune mediators on small blood samples. VIPS II, the continuation of VIPS, will use these techniques to address the paradox of infection as a risk factor for childhood stroke, and to better understand the causes of arteriopathies in children. Our overall hypothesis is that differences in pathogens and host inflammatory responses underlie different stroke subtypes, and hence recurrence risk. The specific aims are to (1) identify known and novel pathogens in children with stroke, and determine whether different pathogens are associated with arteriopathic versus other stroke types; and (2) to determine whether children with arteriopathic stroke have a distinct analyte signature suggesting an alternative pathway of inflammation compared to children with other stroke types.  The goal of VIPS II is to gain the knowledge needed to protect children with stroke from additional brain injury. Its results will guide the selection of currently available therapies?such as antimicrobials and anti-inflammatory medications?for a secondary stroke prevention trial."
"8999531","PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 4)  Prostate cancer is increasingly detected at early stages due to routine PSA screening, leading to a 5-year  survival rate of nearly 100%. However, many screening-detected prostate cancer are indolent, yet about 90%  of men with localized prostate cancer receive upfront aggressive treatments that often cause significant  morbidity. Conversely, some patients with potentially aggressive prostate cancer who would benefit from early  intervention may choose to delay treatment. This dilemma of overtreatment and undertreatment is particularly  acute for patients with clinically defined intermediate risk. Clinical variables alone are not sufficient to  accurately differentiate aggressive and indolent diseases. Biomarkers are urgently needed to refine risk  stratification. In this project, we will focus on three promising biomarkers: mitochondrial DNA, microRNA, and  metabolites. These multi-functional and interconnected molecules are related to obesity, an established risk  factor to aggressive prostate cancer. Leveraging two of the largest prostate cancer patient cohorts in the U.S.,  this project will perform integrative analyses of these biomarkers with clinical variables to more precisely define  aggressive prostate cancer. We will use knowledge gained from comparing extreme phenotypes at diagnosis  (high-risk prostate cancer versus low-risk prostate cancer) to better stratify patients with clinically defined  intermediate risk profiles. There are four specific aims: 1) To identify novel genetic susceptibility factors for  aggressive prostate cancer at diagnosis. We will use a three-phase design: discovery, internal replication, and  external validation. The total number of patients in this aim will be 4,200 (3,000 whites and 1,200 African-  Americans [AA]). We have designed a custom array of about 20,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),  which include SNPs in miRNA regulatory pathways, SNPs in mtDNA, and obesity- and prostate cancer-  predisposing SNPs. 2) To identify novel intermediate biomarkers, including the mtDNA copy number in  peripheral blood leukocyte DNA, circulating miRNAs, and circulating metabolites as predictors of aggressive  prostate cancer at diagnosis. We will again use a three-phase design. 3) To test the prognostic value of  validated biomarkers in special patient populations, including GS 7 patients, localized patients receiving  prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and a special population enrolled in an MD Anderson active surveillance study.  4) To construct multivariate prognostic nomograms that include epidemiological risk factors, clinical variables,  and biomarkers from this project. We will refine clinical variables in predicting the prognosis in patients with GS  of 7 and in localized patients receiving prostatectomy or radiotherapy. We will compare the predictive accuracy  of our nomograms with existing ones that are based solely on clinical variables."
"9147591","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medication errors during transition of care are common; about 50% of the patients have medication discrepancy after discharge from hospitals, and medication error associated adverse drug events are a significant source of prevent harms. The long-term goal of our effort is to develop risk-informed tools for inpatient, transitional and outpatient care providers to effectively engage and support patients to improve patient safety. The overall objective of this project is to develop a patient-centric risk model of medication errors in ambulatory care. The variability and unsatisfactory results in outcomes of transitional care programs is an indication that our knowledge of medication safety in ambulatory care settings is insufficient and excludes potentially effective intervention strategies This project is based on the assumption that human factors approaches can contribute to the understanding of underlying hazards and mitigating strategies in medication safety from a patient-centered perspective, by conceptualizing the roles of health professionals as enhancing the patient work system and supporting the patient to achieve medication safety. The project's aims are: (1) Identify hazards and mitigating strategies to medication safety using a patient work system framework; (2) Develop a patient-centric risk assessment tool through prospective qualitative studies, and (3) Evaluate the risk assessment tool in a multi-site prospective study of hazards and mitigating factors medication safety and their associations with medication discrepancies and potential adverse events. Application of human factors approach is innovative to understand the mechanisms through which system factors increase and decrease the patient's ability to self-manage safely. The epidemiology of hazards and risks in the patient work system and their association with medication safety will enhance future development and deployment of improvement strategies, such as information technology tools, patient engagement and care system design, especially in the context of accountable care for the entire continuum of care. Our project will target the expected high medication error risk periods: care transitions of vulnerable patients with high risk medications. The research team is interdisciplinary with nationally known expertise in human factors, ambulatory care medication safety, patient safety, biostatistics, hospitalist program, and primary care patient safety. Multipe study sites will be used with an expected high representation of two AHRQ priority populations: the elderly and those with low socio-economic status. We also anticipate the value of the risk model to identify specific risk factors contributing to the disparities associated in medication safety."
"9207387","Project Summary/Abstract  Adolescent HIV interventions call for more advanced analytic approaches than traditional HIV studies have used. HIV prevention and treatment research trials have traditionally been conducted in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) framework where study participants, often recruited from social service agencies, are randomized into an intervention or standard of care condition and followed over time. Outcome measures consist of self-reported mental health and HIV transmission behaviors. Three large changes are necessary for adolescent studies in the modern era of HIV research. First, youth are often difficult to identify and engage in HIV care. Innovative recruitment strategies that make use of traditional and technology-based methods are necessary to maximize efforts. Second, NIH research priorities target biomedical HIV endpoints. Combination strategies that target HIV end points and comorbid conditions are needed. Lastly, researchers need to plan for intervention delivery in real-world settings. Youth deal with many complex issues, such as homelessness, that can impede access to and delivery of care, directly impacting biological outcome markers. Studies in the proposed U19 proposal will address current challenges in HIV research by using comprehensive youth engagement strategies and combination prevention strategies to address HIV end points and comorbidities. Statistical methods will be used to evaluate interventions in the RCT framework through complex multilevel models (MLM) to evaluate multiple end points over time. In addition, implementation science methods will be used to examine barriers to HIV care and engagement in clinic settings.  The Analytic Core provides a range of technological, biomedical, and behavioral research expertise that will support research in the current U19 proposal. The Analytic Core is comprised of statisticians with expertise in fitting complex MLM in HIV studies that contain both biomarker and behavioral outcomes. Technologists are also a part of the Core and have used social media recruitment tools, mobile phone-based assessment, and cloud-based data storage in their own HIV research. The Analytic Core also fields expertise in implementation science and cost effectiveness analysis that will be used to address study aims. The Analytic Core will support research across U19 projects through the following specific aims. First, we will provide consultation on web- based tools that will enhance standard recruitment methods and finalize the recruitment sample of seronegative youth based on risk factors from a larger pool of seronegative youth. Second, data collection will be centralized to maximize data quality and security, minimize costs, and facilitate analysis. Dimagi CommCare software that we have used in prior HIV research will be used and provides an integrated package to provide HIPAA-compliant cloud-based data storage and mobile phone or web-based data entry. Third, Core scientists will conduct innovative analyses that include biological, engagement, and behavioral outcomes. Lastly, the Analytic Core will coordinate with the Management Core for timely dissemination of study findings."
"9340488","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthy aging, even in the absence of dementia, is associated with memory decline, particularly for details associated with previously encountered events. Age-related impairments in this associative type of memory are pervasive and dysfunction in prefrontal cortical (PFC) mediated cognitive control functions like comparative reasoning is a major contributor to these impairments. Existing theories of cognitive aging propose unitary, non-specific PFC changes. We contend that such theories oversimplify the role of the PFC in age-related memory impairments. We propose a new control of associative memory in aging model with clear testable predictions that will provide knowledge of the precise control functions and related neural networks affected by aging. Our model predicts that the effects of age are greater for high order than lower order control operations during associative memory encoding and retrieval. We make concrete predictions about both regionally specific and distributed patterns of activity as well as the time course of control functions. Consequently, we will employ a novel multipronged approach utilizing complementary behavioral, univariate and multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, and event-related potential (ERP) to address the following specific aims: (1) We predict that dysfunction in rostral PFC high order processes that support integration of multiple relationships during encoding contributes to age-related associative memory impairments. We predict minimal dysfunction in left caudal PFC supported 1st order item selection and 2nd order inter-item relational encoding processes. We predict that multivariate fMRI analyses will show that reduced functional connectivity within an encoding network containing the rostral PFC contributes t0 poor associative memory performance. (2) We predict that dysfunction in rostral PFC high order processes that support integration of multiple retrieved associations during retrieval contributes to age-related associative memory impairments. We predict minimal dysfunction in right caudal PFC supported post-retrieval monitoring processes. We predict that multivariate fMRI analyses will show that reduced functional connectivity within a retrieval network containing the rostral PFC contributes t0 poor associative memory performance. We predict that ERPs indexing these control functions will be engaged after memory recovery. Post-retrieval ERPs indexing rostral PFC but not caudal PFC functions will be attenuated by aging. The combination of univariate measures of regional activation alongside multivariate measures of functional connectivity and ERPs will provide a more complete understanding of precisely how aging affects PFC function and memory. These results will be essential in developing interventions to improve associative memory functioning by targeting specific cognitive control functions in aging."
"9142284","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The safety and quality of acute patient care is strongly impacted by all levels of organizational leadership, yet few evidence-based methods for developing the knowledge and skills necessary for effective safety leadership currently exist. Simulation clearly improves technical and non-technical competencies of healthcare workers, as well as organizational learning and continuous improvement. However, simulation has not yet been broadly applied to the development of leadership for patient safety. This proposal assembles a multi-disciplinary team with unique and diverse expertise (simulation, training, gaming, engineering, patient safety leadership, business and management, social science of creativity, human factors and organizational psychology), and capitalizes on existing projects (an ongoing executive safety leadership collaborative with hospitals across the country) and strong relationships with state, national, and international healthcare organizations (for the purposes of recruitment) to design, implement, and evaluate organizational simulation for patient safety leadership development. In addition to demonstrating and disseminating organizational simulation as a tool to efficiently develop the technical and transformational leadership skills underlying effective safety leadership, this research advances the science regarding how best to use organizational simulation as a method for developing mid-level and executive safety leadership. Specifically, this project addresses two broad questions. First, is simulation more effective than traditional methods of instruction for improving patient safety leadership competencies? While simulation is generally superior to traditional methods for complex tasks, no comparative studies exist for executive and mi-level leaders in healthcare. Second, what makes simulation most effective and efficient as a training strategy and as a strategy generation tool for patient safety leadership? Two practically relevant approaches are investigated: the configuration of the teams participating in the simulation (intact vs. ad hoc), and a pre-training mindfulness intervention designed to boost learning and performance. Pre-training interventions are a proven way to maximize the efficiency of time spent in learning activities. Mindfulness is a promising cost-effective pre-training strategy that has not yet been evaluated. Given the lack of existing approaches to target healthcare leadership and the proven benefits of simulation in other domains, this research can make strong contributions to the science and practice of patient safety improvement. This project is innovative in that organizational simulation is a novel approach for developing safety leadership, and the online distributed method of delivering simulation to this audience has not been studied; our use of novel assessment approaches including situational judgment tests (SJTs) and coding of leadership behaviors; our application of the social science of creativity to provide valid assessments of problem solving performance, including organizational strategy development; the use of mindfulness training to improve the effectiveness of simulation; and, the diversity of expertise combined in this project team is unique."
"9272249","Project Summary/Abstract While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, the contribution of vascular factors to cognitive impairment and dementia is becoming increasingly recognized. Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is most commonly caused by cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). To date, cerebral small vessels including arterioles, capillaries and venules are inaccessible to existing imaging technologies. Characteristic parenchymal lesions on MRI, such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, and microbleeds, have been adopted as markers of SVD. However, these parenchymal lesions are the consequences of SVD rather than the surrogate markers of microvascular changes, and are unsuitable for early interventions to change the course of VCID. During the past few years, our group has spearheaded the development of a suite of cutting edge MRI technologies for in vivo and noninvasive assessment of microvascular structure and function, including (1) high-resolution black blood MRI for direct imaging of perforating arteries; (2) arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques for mapping microvascular perfusion, arterial stiffness or vascular compliance (VC) of small arteries/arterioles, and water exchange rate across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, we recently developed quantitative metrics for retinal capillary density and morphology using an FDA approved optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) platform. This method allows clinically feasible, in vivo and completely noninvasive imaging of retinal arterioles and capillaries with a spatial resolution of ~10 microns. Capitalizing on our extensive technical expertise and longstanding track record of clinical studies on VCID, we propose this UH2/UH3 project to further develop and evaluate a suite of MRI and OCTA markers for assessing the structure and function of cerebral and retinal microvasculature, in a cohort of Latino subjects enrolled in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) and in the study of autosomal dominant AD in persons of Mexican origin (Estudio de Enfermedad de Alzheimer en Jalisciences, or EEAJ). During the UH2 phase, we will further develop and evaluate the proposed MRI and OCTA imaging markers of SVD, establish their test-retest repeatability and clinical utility. We will work with the other participating sites and with the Coordinating Center to establish collaborative parameters and agreements of the consortium. During the UH3 phase, we will contribute to and execute cross-site research studies as designed by the consortium. We will perform unified and comprehensive clinical, cognitive, imaging, genetic and biochemical assessments on the cohort of LALES and EEAJ participants locally and perform data analyses as required by the consortium. At the closing of this project, we expect to develop the suite of microvascular imaging markers to readiness to enter into large-scale multi-site clinical validation studies toward FDA qualification for phase II and phase III clinical trials on small vessel disease to prevent and treat VCID."
"9165380","Project Summary/Abstract This research will develop wearable sensors analogous to the pulse oximeter, but to monitor heparin anticoagulation therapy and other drugs with a narrow therapeutic window. This work is exceptionally innovative and completely distinct from other work on therapeutic drug monitoring because it is sample-free, acoustics-based, non-invasive, and real-time. This approach is also the only design to measure the heparin/anti-thrombin complex in contrast to existing surrogate methods that simply measure clotting time. Although applicable to multiple drugs, we will focus on heparin because it is a cornerstone (500M doses/year) of surgical and cardiovascular medicine. Heparin has variable molecular weight, activity, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics resulting in a narrow therapeutic window causing heparin to be the second most common medication error. The current standard for heparin monitoring is the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); however, this in vitro diagnostic tool suffers from long turnaround times, a variable reference range, and poor correlation to outcome. To solve this, I will develop novel wearable ultrasound-based sensors. In particular, I will use photoacoustic imaging?a hybrid approach that uses incident light pulses to trigger an acoustic signal. Its spectral nature, intense contrast, and high frame rate facilitates real-time, multiplexed, and high sensitivity measurements. These are ideal features for therapeutic drug monitoring. First, we will synthesize novel sensing molecules. We will then integrate these chemical sensors into wearable devices that will interact with ultrasound transducers to quantitate coagulation without venipuncture. In the final phases of the program, we will validate this approach with animal models and expand this to other drugs such as digoxin and phenytoin as well as multiplexed sensors. Rather than injecting a contrast agent and hoping it goes to the site of disease in vivo or drawing blood and processing it in vitro, this work will immobilize a sensor in situ for constant feedback on anticoagulation therapy. The confluence of imaging technology, wearable technology, and chemical technology that I offer here will truly revolutionize the incredibly common practice of heparin therapy?patients will no longer be subjected to invasive sampling and will avoid dangerous overdoses and underdoses. Doctors and nurses will have instantaneous feedback on their patients and smart infusion pumps will carefully and automatically titrate drug dosages. Long term, this work will translate into significant cost savings for insurers and providers."
"9143771","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ALS affects people in middle to late ages, during a time of life where it is common to suffer from more than one health problem, yet there is little understanding of the effect of chronic medical conditions and medication use on susceptibility to ALS. There is mounting concern and recent evidence that certain medical conditions and medications are associated with an increased risk of developing ALS, while other conditions and medications appear to be inversely associated with ALS risk. We propose to investigate the role of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as the drugs used to treat these disorders, as both risk and prognostic factors for ALS. This study has three specific aims: Aim 1, to investigate the association between antecedent medical conditions and the risk of developing ALS; Aim 2, to examine the relationship between certain classes of medication and the risk of developing ALS; and Aim 3, to determine whether medical conditions or medications present at diagnosis of ALS adversely or positively affect survival with ALS. We will assemble a retrospective cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (Parts A, B and D) during the years 2006 through 2014. To address aims 1 and 2, we will conduct a nested case-control study to identify newly diagnosed (incident) patients with ALS in this cohort between 2008 and 2014 using a modified version of the case definition algorithm used by the National ALS Registry. We expect to identify 11,000 incident ALS cases. Using incidence density sampling, ten age- and sex-matched controls will be randomly chosen for each case from among Medicare beneficiaries who entered the Medicare cohort in the same year as the case, but had who had no codes for ALS, MND or closely related conditions prior to their matched cases' diagnosis dates. We will use Medicare inpatient, outpatient, and laboratory health claims to document the occurrence of metabolic, cardiovascular, and autoimmune conditions among the study subjects both before and after the diagnosis of ALS. The availability of Part D (pharmaceutical) claims for Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 onward will provide the opportunity to examine the association of commonly used medications with the risk and prognosis of ALS. We will use conditional logistic regression analyses to identify premorbid medical conditions and medications associated with the risk of developing ALS. To address specific aim 3, we will link the data from our incident ALS case group to mortality data and conduct survival analyses to determine whether antecedent medical conditions and medications present at diagnosis are associated with either shortened or prolonged survival with ALS. We will use survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between these conditions/medications and survival with ALS. This study will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role that metabolic factors, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity play in the etiology and prognosis of ALS, and could lead to the development of new preventive or therapeutic interventions to prolong survival in ALS patients."
"9240452","Project Summary/Abstract Many signaling pathways linked to aging are linked to the regulation of metabolic signaling and stress response pathways. For instance, the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is an evolutionarily-conserved nutrient-sensing protein kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in all eukaryotic cells. Two complexes, mTORC1 and 2, have overlapping upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Reduced mTOR signaling, either by genetic intervention or with the clinically approved drug rapamycin, extends longevity in mice (as well as yeast, worms and flies) and delays many pathologies of aging. Given its central role in aging and metabolism, it is critical to understand how different perturbations of the mTOR pathway impact aging and metabolism. Here, we use mouse models and cell culture studies to test one of the major downstream targets of mTORC1, 4E-BP1. Justifying the emphasis on 4E-BP1, enhanced 4E-BP activity is associated with lifespan extension in worms and flies, and we find that transgenic mice overexpressing 4E-BP1 are resistant to high fat diet-induced metabolic dysfunction. We will employ multiple mouse models of 4E-BP1 overexpression in both overnutrition and aging studies. Preliminary data indicates that an inflammation-induced loss of 4E-BP1 expression in the context of a high fat diet underlies the specific propensity of males to become glucose intolerant and insulin resistant. We will determine the mechanisms underlying this gender dimorphism and its impact on the mTOR pathway. Gender-specific responses to diet and aging are rampant in mouse models and in humans, but the underlying causes of gender-specificity is largely unknown. In addition, we will determine why muscle specific activation of 4E-BP1 preserves both skeletal muscle function and brown fat content during overnutrition and aging, focusing on recent findings linking the benefits to skeletal muscle production and secretion of the myokine, FGF21. Together, these studies will yield several new insights regarding the specifics of mTOR signaling in the context of aging and metabolism, providing a better understanding about how this pathway modulates aging and linking modulation of the mTOR pathway to other pharmacologic interventions in aging."
"9224479","Project Summary  The United States has a large and rapidly growing Latino population. At the same time, Latinos and transgender persons in the US carry disproportionate HIV burden. Currently, no efficacious HIV prevention interventions exist for transgender persons who have sex with men. In response to RFA-PS-16-003 ?Evaluating Locally-Developed or Adapted (Homegrown) Combination HIV Prevention Interventions for Transgender Persons who have Sex with Men?, our community-university partnership proposes a 4-year study (U01) to refine, fully implement, and rigorously evaluate a small-group combination intervention designed to promote behavioral, biomedical, and social/structural approaches to HIV prevention by increasing condom use, HIV testing, PrEP use, and use of safe transition-related healthcare services among Latina transgender women who have sex with men. The intervention, known as Chicas Creando Acceso a la Salud (ChiCAS; Girls Creating Access to Health), was developed locally by a community-based organization, in partnership with Latina transgender women, and is informed by social cognitive theory and theory of empowerment education. Although data suggest that ChiCAS is promising, it has not yet been evaluated.  The proposed study is a result of a well-established community-university partnership. A total of 100 Latina transgender women who have sex with men will be enrolled. Participants will complete an initial baseline assessment designed to measure current sexual health behaviors, healthcare use, and psychological, social, and cultural influences on sexual behaviors and healthcare use. Participants then will be randomized to the 4- session small-group combination HIV prevention intervention group or a delayed-intervention comparison group (waitlist). All participants also will complete identical assessments at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Participants in the HIV prevention intervention, relative to their peers in the delayed-intervention comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (a) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse; (b) increased HIV testing; (c) increased use of PrEP; and (d) increased use of safe transition-related healthcare services (including medical care and mental health services). The results and products from this study will be disseminated to inform public health practice, research, and policy. Results and products will include: (1) a Spanish-language combination small-group HIV prevention intervention that is: culturally congruent, designed to reduce risk among Latina transgender women, and ready for dissemination and further implementation if found to be efficacious; and (2) a deeper understanding of HIV risk, use of transition-related healthcare services, and intervention among Latina transgender women."
"9228115","Abstract Understanding the exact cell-type composition in brain regions is a fundamental step when trying to integrate physiological, behavioral, neurochemical and molecular data. At present, although major categories of cell- types present in cortex have been defined through a handful of specific markers, the different subtypes within these categories, as well as their location and connectivity are far from understood. DNA methylation (mC) is a stable covalent modification that persists in post-mitotic cells throughout their lifetime, defining their cellular identity. Methylation patterns are cell type specific, differentiating the major types of cells i.e., neurons and glia, in the rodent and human cortex, as well as differentiating neuronal types in mouse cortex. However, little is known about what identifies the populations of neurons belonging specific categories within a brain region e.g. pyramidal neurons in different cortical layers or areas of frontal cortex. This project proposes to develop the technology necessary to address the challenge of producing single-neuron mC maps in a cortical layer-specific manner using human postmortem frontal-cortex tissue. Expansion of this methodology will ultimately lead to a thorough classification of all neuronal types in the human brain."
"9188322","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to modernize in vitro toxicology testing to facilitate comprehensive evaluation of biological response profiles to engineered nanomaterials. To ensure that high-content evaluation of response profiles can be measured using human-relevant systems, our platform is based on organ-on-chip technologies presently used for pharmacology and in vitro disease models. We extend the capability of these systems by introducing novel exposure chips that recapitulate a variety of exposure routes and interface with existing organ chips. Nanomaterials administered through exposure chips to the underlying organs may elicit exposure route- dependent responses that we aim to quantify. Specific project aims include quantitative comparison of cardiac and airway tissue response profiles to engineered nanomaterials administered by direct exposure, through and endothelial barrier, through tissue engineered vasculature, or through a synthetic skin tissue. We focus on cardiac and airway organ models because they are established platforms that provide robust metrics of tissue viability, structure, and function, in response to pharmacological challenges. We extend the capabilities of these organ systems for nanomaterial toxicity testing with the addition of exposure chips. To model intravenous and topical delivery routes, successive variations of the exposure chips will recapitulate endothelial barrier properties and engineered dermal tissues with increasing fidelity. The proposed work builds on our laboratory?s expertise manufacturing and testing organ-on-chip in vitro toxicology platforms. Our team is a leader in this field, developing diverse organ models and exploring their interactions for drug screening and disease modeling applications. We have extensive experience fabricating modular organ chips and the proposed exposure chip will be broadly applicable to organ models beyond the original focus on cardiac and airway systems. Standardization of our organ chip manufacturing ensures that exposure chips can be interfaced with a broad and expanding arsenal or human organ models. Importantly, we expect this work will lead to future exposure chips encompassing an expanding number of delivery routes."
"9161024","PROJECT SUMMARY: Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world and the leading cause of low vision in the United States. Cataracts are devastating to those who have lost their vision, and the only accepted cure, surgery, is a major economic burden to health care. Cataracts occur when large aggregates of cellular material form in the lens and scatter light. Although, there are several pathways in cataract formation, all are associated with aggregation of the structural proteins, called crystallins. We have identified deamidation as a major, if not the major, modification of lens crystallins, during normal aging and cataracts. The most heavily deamidated crystallins are ?B1, ?A3, and ?S. Along with ?A, these proteins are also the major components of the insoluble proteins from aged lenses. In 15 deamidated mimics of the ?-crystallins all, but one, decreases stability and increases the propensity to aggregate. Therefore, we hypothesize that an accumulation of deamidated crystallins is a major cause of cataracts. We propose that deamidation induces aggregation by 1) disrupting structure, 2) altering crystallin-crystallin interactions, and 3) saturating ?-crystallin, the native chaperone in the lens. We have determined that deamidation, at critical interfaces within ?-crystallin dimers, creates solvent accessible pockets that decrease stability and increase susceptibility to proteolysis and UV-B damage. Deamidation, on surfaces, alters interactions between ?-crystallins. And, deamidation causes aggregation more readily during crystallin unfolding preventing rescue by ?-crystallin. In this proposal, we will determine the protective protein interactions in the lens that prevent aggregation of deamidated crystallins. We will determine the functional significance to our recent finding that ?-crystallins are not static, but have different conformations in hetero-oligomers. We will determine the role of a flexible loop we have recently identified to be a potential site of crystallin interactions. And, we will solve structures of ?- and ?- complexes. We will use state-of-the-art NMR, hydrogen deuterium exchange with high-resolution mass spectrometry, and cryo-electron microscopy using high-end instruments not found elsewhere. We will screen for the most disruptive deamidation sites using expressed deamidated mimics with lens extracts from human donor lenses and by over-expressing mimics in zebrafish, including in a ?A-crystallin knock-out zebrafish. We will directly link deamidation with aggregation in vivo. The goal is to understand complex interactions between crystallins in order to stabilize them and rescue deamidated crystallins from aggregation. Deamidation has also been detected in other protein aggregation diseases, such as Alzheimer's, and our findings will provide insight into a potential shared mechanism in these more devastating neurological diseases."

The overall goal of this research, called Deaf Weight Wise 2.0 (DWW 2.0), is to adapt an evidenced-based healthy lifestyle intervention for use with Deaf adult American Sign Language (ASL) users ages 21-40, delivered either locally as an in-person group intervention or remotely as an individual counseling intervention via videophone (VP), and to assess the interventions with a randomized trial. The VP, an existing technology that is virtually ubiquitous in the US Deaf community, has broad implications for remote delivery of health interventions with Deaf and other populations. RPRC's overarching premise is that an evidenced-based healthy lifestyle intervention adapted by Deaf people for use with Deaf people and delivered by Deaf people will improve diet, physical activity and weight. DWW 2.0 builds on RPRC strengths including a longstanding collaboration with the Rochester Deaf community, experience adapting measures and materials for use with Deaf ASL users, and a successful research focus on obesity intervention with Deaf ASL users. DWW 2.0 is responsive to the Deaf community in that it focuses on: 1) obesity, a health disparity that the Deaf community selected as a health research priority, 2) an age demographic identified by the Deaf community for inclusion in health promotion research, and 3) scalability and the request that the benefits of RPRC research be extended to reach Deaf communities outside of Rochester. RPRC, a unit of the Rochester Clinical and Translational Science Institute, brings academic health center expertise to these issues. DWW 2.0 is consistent with RPRC's work with the Rochester Community Transformation Grant and local health department. RPRC activities match the PRC FOA aims and support the Healthy People 2020 Goal to promote the health and well-being of people with disabilities."
"9253936","Project Summary A key goal of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) research is to understand how changes in gene expression contribute to the development of disease. While numerous individual transcriptional changes have been identi- fied in both human MDD and animal models of depression, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how single gene alterations interact to mediate the disease state. Intriguingly, more transcriptional alterations are observed in the brains of animals that undergo stressful stimuli but do not develop depression-like behav- ior, however, the network-level transcriptional alterations associated with resilience have not been explored. The overall objective of this proposal is to characterize gene networks associated with resilience in the Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS) model of depression in mice. My central hypothesis is that network-level changes in gene expression drive resilience to CSDS, and that manipulation of resilient-specific networks by modulating individual network regulators will modify resilience in animal models of stress. The rationale for this research is that the resilient phenotype in CSDS is associated with many antidepressant-like changes, so elucidation of these alterations in a network context, as well as identification of regulators of these changes, will enhance our understanding of changes in gene expression following stress and identify novel targets for antidepressant therapeutics. My hypothesis will be tested by two Specific Aims. Aim 1 characterizes the transcriptional net- works associated with resilience to CSDS. In this Aim, I will use bioinformatics to contextualize networks of gene expression that exist across several brain regions in resilient, but not susceptible, mice in terms of both structure and function. Additionally, I will compare these networks to networks from post-mortem MDD patients to determine their disease relevance. Aim 2 determines whether induction of gene co-expression networks regulates depression-like behavior. In this Aim, I will test the effect of overexpressing or knocking down module regulators in specific brain regions in vivo on depression-like behavior in CSDS and sub-threshold variable stress. Further, I will use RNA expression assays to determine the mechanisms by which regulator genes alter the expression of other genes in their module and therefore affect behavior. To achieve these goals, I will re- ceive training from my primary sponsor, Dr. Eric Nestler, and my co-sponsor Dr. Bin Zhang. Dr. Nestler is an expert in molecular psychiatry and has published extensively on the molecular mechanisms of depression. Dr. Zhang is a leader in genomics and was one of the primary developers of Weighted Gene Co-Expression Net- work Analysis. Working closely with them, as well as participating in targeted coursework and career develop- ment activities, I will receive in-depth training in genomics, bioinformatics, molecular neuroscience, and mouse behavior that will help me to successfully perform the experiments outlined in this proposal as well as achieve my long-term and career goals."
"9071755","PROJECT SUMMARY ? LYMPHOMA & LEUKEMIA PROGRAM  The goal of the Lymphoma and Leukemia (LL) Program is to gain a better understanding of the biology  underlying lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms and to apply this knowledge to improve the diagnosis and  treatment of these disorders. In working toward this goal, this broad research program encompasses major  aims of disease pathogenesis, clinical pathological relationships, the use of biomarkers in patient  stratification, novel therapeutics, and clinical trials. Program members have emphasized translational  research to the clinic in diagnostics and novel therapeutics, and from the clinic to the laboratory in  correlative studies on tissues matched with clinical events. The laboratory-based projects are focused on  the characterization of leukemia stem cells; elucidation of signaling pathways in individual tumor cells;  determination of mechanisms of lymphomagenesis with specific attention to the MYC oncogene, and  analysis of the role of the immune system in specific relation to lymphomas and leukemias. Novel  diagnostics have been developed, including the discovery of founder genetic mutations and novel tests for  monitoring tumor responses using cell-free DNA. The LL Program has developed new ways of enhancing  the therapeutic activity of monoclonal antibodies by stimulating NK killer cells (anti-CD137), novel drug-  antibody conjugates (Brentuximab Vedotin), and a new method of therapeutic vaccination (in situ  vaccination with TLR9 ligands and immune checkpoint antibodies). Program members have also played  major roles in the development of novel targeted therapies (BTK inhibitor, Ibrutinib, and the PI3 kinase delta  inhibitor, Idealisib). Studies from the program have been influential in changing medical practice worldwide.  Future plans include combining targeted small molecules with immunotherapies in the hope of replacing  current cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens with safer, more effective therapies.  Co-led by Ronald Levy, MD and Ravindra Majeti, MD, PhD the 24 LL Program members represent 11  departments within the School of Medicine and the School of Engineering. Peer-reviewed funding is  represented by a total of $6.7M in total annual costs of which $4.2M is from the NCI, $0.9M from other NIH  sources, and $1.7M from other peer-reviewed support mechanisms. Since 2009, program investigators  have published over 375 manuscripts, of which 28% are intra-programmatic, 32% inter-programmatic, and  numerous manuscripts with external collaborators. The SCI will continue to be invaluable in the seeding of  innovative projects and assisting with the translation of basic science findings of this program into new  clinical approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with Lymphoma and Leukemia."

"9133179","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic attachment or the direct skeletal attachment of artificial limbs, across the amputation stump skin into the residual bone, is a rapidly evolving technology that is now ready to be introduced into the United States, following greater than a decade of European trials that largely involved transfemoral amputees. Translational animal research carried out over the past seven years at the Bone and Joint Research Laboratory, VAH, Salt Lake City, Utah, has clarified principles of osseointegration, and bone and skin interface responses to chronic weight bearing of the residual bone containing a percutaneous implant. This information has produced new prosthetic designs that make the technique safer and more likely to succeed over the long-term. This translational animal data, gathered parallel to the European human data, has made possible an Early Feasibility Device Exemption (IDE) Pilot Program under the direction of the FDA. This trial is anticipated to begin in May 2014, at the VAH in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is funded by VA RR&D grant (RX001208-01). Ten transfemoral amputees, selected from the veteran and active military populations will receive the device. The critical limiting factor to the prior U.S. introduction of this technology has been  an up to 30% infection rate at the implant/skin interface in European patients. Evolving designs and surgical techniques have lowered this incidence, but it remains remarkable that 70% to perhaps 95% of European patients now remain infection free with simply mild soap and shower hygiene at the stoma, and avoid the use of antibiotics. In fact antibiotics and disinfectants are often counter productive, and lead to antibiotic resistance. It seems increasingly evident that the  key to this improbable success is the biology and mutualistic-commensal microbiota at the skin/implant interface: the bacterial guard dogs at the gate.  This pending 10 patient Pilot Tria offers a unique, 1 year long, opportunity to study the evolving microbiota (Aim 1), and the wound healing and inflammatory cytokine environment of the skin/implant interface and surrounding skin as well as the systemic immune protein response to this percutaneous device (Aim 2); all determined at the same time points. Hopefully, this study will give measurable understanding as to why stomas do or don't become infected and to anticipate the onset of infection (Primary Goal). Serial skin swab bacterial DNA samples will be collected beginning with the Stage 1 surgery (device implantation with wound closure and primary wound healing) and 6 weeks later the Stage 2 surgery (establishment of the stoma; a chronic wound). Amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes, obtained from this DNA, will be followed by sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform and will determine the resident microbiota at the stoma and adjacent thigh skin throughout the processes of primary wound healing and chronic stomal maturation. Simultaneous to the microbiome collection, venous blood and stomal exudate specimens will be obtained to compare systemic versus local inflammatory protein responses. The serial venous blood samples will be used to determine the instantaneous status of the host immune system and will be subjected to microarray analysis of immune system proteins using custom TaqMan microfluidic array cards (192 genes). This will measure the up and down regulation of host mRNA that translates the synthesis of immune system proteins i.e. cytokines and chemokines. Analysis of the stomal-exudate, using the BioPlex multiplex immunoassay and MagPix platform, will measure the levels of 27 wound healing and inflammatory cytokines in the local wound environment. Statistical analyses will compare each patient against himself/herself over time, and against the others (commonality of microbiota and infection vs. a stable, and uninfected stoma)."
"9074442","Abstract ? Project 3 (The Functional Contribution of Tumor Immunity to PDAC)  PDAC is marked by an extensive desmoplastic reaction/stroma consisting of myofibroblasts, extracellular  matrix (ECM) and immune cells, and oncogenic Kras is a critical driver of PDAC genesis and maintenance.  The functional importance of PDAC microenvironment and its various cellular constituent in oncogenic Kras  dependent and independent PDAC maintenance remains an area of active investigation, but there is minimal  knowledge addressing the role of oncogenic Kras in shaping tumor immunity, in particular the T cell response.  The central mission of our P01 program is to collectively identify a range of novel Kras driven vulnerable nodes  that can be inhibited as a treatment for this devastating disease. The inducible oncogenic Kras genetically  engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC indicated that tumor regression could be achieved via oncogenic  Kras extinction, a process accompanied by depletion of oncogenic Kras dependent cancer cells and significant,  albeit incompletely characterized, alterations in immune response. Studies from Projects 1 and 2 using this  PDAC GEMM also offered mechanistic insights into spontaneous tumor relapse, which includes the presence  oncogenic Kras extinction resistant cells (KRC) with distinct metabolic dependencies (OXPHOS), and the  emergence of tumors with activation of YAP or other yet unidentified mechanism for PDAC maintenance.  Projects 1 and 2 will focus on exploiting the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells and the central hypothesis  of Project 3 is that ?oncogenic Kras and its signaling surrogates have a causal effect on tumor immunity to  facilitate cancer progression?. Knowledge of this oncogenic Kras driven circuitry may illuminate therapeutic  points of intervention in the tumor microenvironment and offer an improved understanding of how to deploy  checkpoint blockade therapies in combination with cancer cell-specific therapies targeting metabolic or salvage  pathways. The study could inform combination treatment that includes checkpoint blockade therapies ? i.e.,  whether OXPHOS inhibition or autophagy inhibition can help or impede such immunotherapy strategies. The  studies proposed by Project 3 are highly interconnected with studies proposed in Projects 1 and 2, and rely  directly on all the Cores of this P01. Specifically, the integrated specific aims of Project 3 are to investigate  Kras* dependent and independent immune response in PDAC (Aim 1), to determine the impact of targeting  metabolic and salvage pathways on tumor immunity (Aim 2) and to identify novel strategies to enhance  efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in PDAC (Aim 3). This effort is integral to the overall P01  Program Goal of developing a mechanism-based rational combination strategy that can lead to meaningful  therapeutic advances for PDAC patients."
"9157040","The Project Summary  Psychostimulants are known to decrease food intake (hypophagia) while increasing drinking (polydipsia). Although the anorectic properties of stimulants are highly exploited in supplements marketed for weight loss, the specific mechanisms underlying the effects of stimulants on consummatory behaviors are not well understood. The aim of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the neuronal circuitry underlying stimulant induced hypohpagia and polydipsia.  Evolving evidence points to a role for dopamine and dopamine receptors in the striatum in regulating consummatory behaviors, and specifically dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the striatum. D2Rs are Gi/o- coupled receptors which exert inhibitory control over a number of neurochemically distinct populations of cells within the striatum including GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons, cholinergic interneurons and dopaminergic terminals emanating from the midbrain. Due to this ubiquitous expression and the poor selectivity of pharmacological agents, it has previously been impossible to study the roles of specific D2R subpopulations using pharmacological methods or global knockouts. Therefore, I will take advantage of recently generated conditional mice to selectively target D2R deletion in specific subpopulations of neurons. Recent evidence from our laboratory suggests that these transgenic manipulations result in differential locomotor behaviors and behavioral responses to stimulants. Thus, I hypothesize D2Rs localized to a specific subpopulation of striatal neurons will have disparate control over stimulant-induced hypophagia and polydipsia.  To explore this idea I will profile the effects of various stimulants on food and water intake in wild type mice, as well as conditional knockouts for the three D2R-containing neuronal types described above (Aim 1). I will then use cell-specific manipulations of D2R-expressing neurons to determine their effect on stimulant-induced hypophagia and polydipsia. I will do this using optogenetics, chemogenetics and viral re-expression of D2Rs (Aim 2). Finally, I will use conventional and cutting edge technologies, such as viral tracing and CLARITY processing, in order to identify the circuitry underlying D2R modulation of stimulant induced polydipsia and hypophagia. Specifically, I will look at projections from the ventral striatum to the lateral hypothalamus, which are known to regulate food and water intake (Aim 3).  The objective of these studies is to understand the role of D2Rs in the striatum in modulating stimulant- induced changes in food and water intake. In doing so, I will gain comprehensive training in genetic methods, circuitry mapping techniques and scientific inquiry. Better understanding of the neuronal circuitry underlying stimulant induced hypophagia and polydipsia will inform the development of anti-obesity drugs and provide insight into minimizing the anorexic side effects of psychostimulant medications used to treat ADHD."
"9188444","PROJECT SUMMARY  The increasing trend in human exposure to engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) calls for interdisciplinary researches to assess the biological impacts from nanomaterials and discover the fundamental factors that contribute to such impacts. We hypothesize that, the surface and other physicochemical properties of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) affect adsorption of biomolecules like proteins, and the corona formed by the adsorbed biomolecules subsequently mediate interaction with biological systems. To test this hypothesis, our integrated study carried out by a team of chemists, immunologists, and environmental engineers will look at the effects of these interactions on activation of inflammatory and immune responses in tissues, as well as the effect on the dynamic microbial community in the gut. Our focus will be mainly on the interactions between environmental ENMs and mucosal tissues such as the airways and gut, where individuals will first encounter the ENMs; consequently, cellular interactions will also focus on lung alveolar macrophages and epithelium, intestinal epithelium, and mucosal immune tissues. We will also study the effects of chronic exposure on tissues in vivo using an environmental chamber. Three specific aims are incorporated into our research program: (1) To generate and characterize the corona-bearing ENMs for in vitro and in vivo study and dissect the relationship between corona formation and ENM's physicochemical properties; (2) To acquire the in vitro and in vivo toxicity and immune response profiles induced by corona-carrying ENMs and determine the impact of sub-chronic and chronic exposure to inhaled ENMs on cell and tissue responses to antigen; and (3) To analyze impacts from the corona-carrying ENMs on gut microbiomes. Our work will identify the protein fingerprints of the coronas formed in the exposure-relevant biological fluids, discover the correlation between corona composition and a collection of ENM properties, and reveal the biological responses from cells, tissues, and mice to the corona-carrying ENMs. Together, we will provide an integrated and comprehensive view of the biological and health impacts of nanomaterials in our environment. The long term goal of our work is to deliver knowledge that could help to predict the biological impacts of ENMs by their physicochemical properties."

BCM is a premier academic health science center known for excellence in education, research, and patient care. The BCM main campus is located in the Texas Medical Center, which is the largest medical center in the world. The Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at BCM was established in 1982 and has created an academic culture defined by and supportive of collaborative research and teaching. Supported by NIH, PCORI, NEH, the Greenwall Foundation, the Milbank Memorial Fund, the Ford Foundation, and other private foundations, the Center's faculty have engaged in collaborative research that has resulted in more than 550 publications in the peer-reviewed literature, 150 chapters in medical and scientific textbooks, 100 chapters in scholarly monographs, and 35 edited or authored books. Ms. Guerrini is a graduate of Harvard Law School (JD 2001) and the University of Virginia (BA 1998), and she is currently a graduate student at University of Texas School of Public Health (MPH expected 2016). She was a practicing intellectual property attorney before transitioning to academia and has served as a full-time instructor in law schools in New York and Chicago. Ms. Guerrini recently completed an intellectual property fellowship at Chicago-Kent College of Law. She has published in academic law journals and this spring will have additional articles published in the peer-reviewed literature. Ms. Guerrini has served as an invited presenter or moderator at multiple legal conferences and colloquia, including the Supreme Court Intellectual Property Review, PatCon, the Law and Society Association Annual Meeting, the Chicago Intellectual Property Colloquium, and the Licensing Executives Society (US & Canada) Annual Meeting. Although Ms. Guerrini's academic and professional experiences to date have provided her a solid foundation in normative analysis and empirical methods, she will benefit from additional training to achieve her long-term career goals. These goals include becoming (1) an independent investigator and leader in the study of ELSI issues related to emerging models of biomedical research and (2) an expert in the conduct of qualitative and experimental studies to collect data that will inform health policies. To achieve these goals, Ms. Guerrini has proposed focused training in the following areas: theoretical and applied ethics; qualitative research design and data analysis; and conjoint analysis design and data analysis. The proposed plan also includes advanced instruction in genomics. The training will consist of formal coursework in ethics and genomics at Baylor College of Medicine and formal coursework in qualitative methodology and statistics at University of Texas School of Public Health, in addition to intensive training in conjoint analysis methodology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. This coursework and the proposed research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Amy L. McGuire of BCM and co-mentors Dr. Sheryl A. McCurdy of University of Texas School of Public Health and Dr. John F.P. Bridges of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In addition, Dr. Richard Gibbs of BCM and Ms. Sharon Terry of Genetic Alliance will advise on the project as needed. The proposed research concerns the question of ownership claims and interests in the outputs of genomic research conducted in a collaborative ?citizen science? context. The internet is providing opportunities for citizen scientists to participate in the design and conduct of studies, and these initiatives are increasingly prevalent in the field of genomics, where web-based portals are collecting genetic sequencing data and connecting individuals to genomic studies requesting varying levels of involvement. It is unclear, however, whether genomic citizen scientists have legitimate claims to the outputs of that research?i.e., the findings, written products, and discoveries that are the results of the studies that they support. This research will identify gaps in practice, policy, principles, and preferences relevant to ownership interests in genomic citizen science outputs to provide a normative and empirical foundation from which to develop best practices and policies that will promote public trust and engagement in biomedical research."
"9148232","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mustard gas (sulfur mustard, SM) and related vesicants have been used as weapons of war and are considered by the US government to be a potential terrorist threat to the civilian population. These agents cause rapid, significant and debilitating injuries to the skin, lungs and eyes. The eye and particularly the cornea is the tissu most sensitive to exposure. SM exposure drives microvesication with Deepithelialization of the corneal surface and results in significant pain and degradation of vision. No effective treatment for vesicant injury is known. Treatments that could reduce the corneal lesions and accelerate healing of the corneal surface would be highly valuable subsequent to an attack. The goal of this research is to produce effective therapeutics for SM corneal injury by using engineered versions of naturally occurring growth factors. These substances, including many members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, are part of the natural wound healing response and can accelerate the healing of a wide variety of corneal wounds. The efficacy of both endogenously produced and exogenously applied growth factors in the context of SM injury may be limited by the sensitivity of growth factors to inactivation by SM, degradation by proteases induced following injury and/or by diffusion of the growth factors from the surface of the eye and the wound bed. We have produced engineered versions of FGF-1, a key growth factor involved in the healing process, that should overcome many of the limitations of the endogenous protein and facilitate its use as an ocular therapy for mustard gas exposure. This research project will first test engineered FGF-1 (eFGF-1) molecules for efficacy in the rabbit corneal organ culture model to prove the hypothesis that the eFGF-1s can accelerate healing of vesicant injury. Two eFGF-1 molecules that 1) lack any of the free thiols of native FGF-1; 2) have additional stability enhancing mutations including an internal disulfide bond; and 3) do not require heparin co-factors will be evaluated. These derivatives should not be modified by any residual SM, be considerably less susceptible to proteolysis and should be retained in the wound site through interactions with sulfated proteoglycans of the extracellular matrix. The ability of these molecules to accelerate the regeneration and proliferation of the ocular surface and inhibit the expression of wound related markers will be shown. Finally, the ability of the eFGF-1s to accelerate healing in the rabbit eye following SM exposure in vivo will be demonstrated. If this work is successful, these eFGF-1s will be advanced into clinical development for SM injury."
"9264243","ABSTRACT Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects neurons in the striatum and cortex, and for which there is currently no effective treatment. HD is caused by a CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene leading to a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the encoded protein (HTT), and patients with a CAG expansion greater than 38 repeats exhibit chorea, psychological problems, and cognitive decline. Expression of mutant HTT leads to selective neuronal dysfunction and degeneration despite its ubiquitous expression pattern. Recent advances in stem cell research suggest that patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may provide novel models of disease and new treatments for diseases. These studies will utilize iPSCs derived from HD patients (HD-iPSCs) as a human model of HD. Using genetic engineering, we generated an isogenic allelic HD-iPSC series for HD modeling (CAG repeat of 21, 45, 72, 100). To understand the molecular basis for the CAG repeat expansion dependent disease phenotypes in NSCs, we performed transcriptomic analysis of HD iPSCs and HD neural stem cells (NSCs) compared to isogenic controls. Differential gene expression and pathway analysis pointed to TGF-? and netrin-1 as the top dysregulated pathways, and dysregulated genes were enriched for those involved in neuronal development and the formation of the dorsal striatum. The disrupted striatal and neuronal networks could be modulated to correct HD phenotypes and provide therapeutic targets. Therefore the isogenic HD-iPSCs with corrected alleles provides mechanistic insights into the disease process and allows the identification of novel therapeutic targets for HD. Indeed our studies suggest that factors that lead to the maturation or maintenance of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are likely to ameliorate Huntington's disease phenotypes. We have found that netrin leads to enhanced rate of maturation of MSNs with increased spontaneous electrical activity and increased levels of DARPP-32. We will investigate the following aims in this application: Specific Aim 1. We will characterize the cellular and functional deficits in normal iPSCs, HD-iPSCs, and genetically corrected HD- iPSCs differentiated into medium spiny neurons using ?omics? approaches; Specific Aim 2. Using DARPP-32 genomic elements that direct gene expression specifically in mature MSNs, we will develop a marker of mature MSNs and identify factors that mediate differentiation and maintenance of MSNs for this cellular HD model; Specific Aim 3. We will determine if factors that promote MSN differentiation or maintenance ameliorate HD phenotypes in mouse models of the disease. Therapeutic targets will be identified and new treatments for HD will be explored."
"9150993","Project Summary / Abstract  We propose to continue and expand the impact of a six-day summer short course on genomics for Native American college and university students with a background and interest in genomics. The short-term goals of the program, entitled the Summer Internship for Native Americans in Genomics (SING), are to train Native American students in next-generation genomic and bioinformatics analyses and to build capacity for scientific research of Native American communities. Additionally, the SING program builds a support network for indigenous scholars in the STEM fields. We expand the impact of the SING short course by having additional venues of the SING short course at universities with established research programs involving indigenous peoples and genomics in different geographic regions of the United States. Parts of the SING short course will be tailored to specific issues of indigenous peoples of the geographic region and will take advantage of the expertise of faculty of the host institutions. Specifically, we propose to convene the SING short course at the University of Arizona in 2017 with a specialized module on cancer genomics and precision health, the University of Washington in 2018 with a specialized module in pharmacogenomics and then back at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a specialized module in transcriptomics and epigenetics. The expertise of the SING faculty and resources available at the host universities provide enriching environments to educate Native American students and tackle important problems of genomics with indigenous communities. Our unique short course with significant hands-on training in molecular biology, bioinformatics and ELSI strategies transform education for underrepresented minorities in the scientific community. This program will continue to be empirically evaluated and continue to serve as a model for other institutions."
"9269747","The goal of the ENCODE Project is to provide the biomedical community with a complete and biologically interpretable annotation of the human genome. This means discovering and mapping all parts of all genes, including exons, introns, promoters and cis-regulatory sequences, in previous phases of the ENCODE Project, the applicants of this proposal developed and applied robust, high-throughput, genome-wide methods for determining transcription factor occupancy, assessing DNA methylation, identifying RNA transcripts, and experimentally testing candidate regulatory elements and mutations. The combination of experiences from the previous phases with the resulting technology and analysis platforms and the existing, highly productive infrastructure of the applicants form the basis of this response to NHGRI's RFA-HG-11-024 (Expanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Model Organisms). This application presents an ambitious proposal to expand the biological dimensions of ENCODE to include essentially all transcription factors for measurements of occupancy and to produce transcriptomes from hundreds of very specific cell types, and even single cells. The specific plan is to: 1) determine genome wide occupancy for all transcription factors and major cofactors with high resolution in two or more cell types; 2) map and quantify all messenger RNA transcripts, microRNAs and other non-ribosomal RNAs in more than 300 well-defined, uncultured cell types; 3) map DNA methylation state genome-wide at nucleotide resolution in more than 300 cell types; and 4) apply a high-throughput transient transfection assay system to test the impact of -2,000 candidate regulatory elements on gene regulation. All experimental work in this project will be evaluated by appropriate quality metrics, and after quality control, all data will be rapidly deposited in publi, freely accessible genome databases. In addition, computational analyses, including evaluation of comparative and population genomics data, will be integrated with the experimental production to help ensure quality and to capture information in forms useful to biologists, genomicists, and medical researchers. Completion of these Specific Aims will enable biomedical researchers to better and more rapidly understand the consequences of mutations in genomic disorders, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and almost ail common diseases and, therefore, to more fully realize the potential of genomics to impact human health."
"9145640","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  ANti-infective Stewardship using the Wisca tool in the Electronic medical Record (The ANSWER study) Beginning in the mid-to late 1980s and accelerating through the 1990s and 2000s the shield of antibiotic invincibility began to crack sufficiently so tat it was apparent to everyone we faced a serious problem. Resistance began to be reported in Gram-negative bacteria toward the newer cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and even the carbapenem drugs. During this same period we also witnessed the emergence and spread of a new healthcare associated infection called Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea as well as MRSA becoming pandemic. We now face a healthcare setting where as many as 70% of the bacterial infections afflicting our patients are resistant to at least one antimicrobial that was initially active againt their historical ancestors. Our objectives will be in the main area that describes our focus for this application, which is Antimicrobial Stewardship: Preventing the development and spread of resistant organisms in the healthcare setting. There are two specific aims for this research program to accomplish.

"9197892","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microenvironmental determinants of glioma cell behavior are incompletely understood. The age and neuroanatomical location predilections of glioma occurrence indicate important interactions between the cell of origin and its microenvironment and suggest dysregulation of mechanisms of neurodevelopment and/or plasticity. We recently showed active neurons exert a mitogenic effect on normal neural precursor and oligodendroglial precursor cells, the putative cellular origins for high-grade glioma (HGG). We now preliminarily demonstrate that active neurons similarly promote HGG proliferation in vivo using optogenetic control of cortical neuronal activity in a patient-derived pediatric glioblastoma orthotopic xenograft model. Activity-regulated mitogen(s) are secreted, as the conditioned medium from optogenetically stimulated cortical slices promoted proliferation of pediatric and adult patient-derived HGG cultures. The synaptic protein neuroligin-3 (NLGN3) was identified as the leading candidate mitogen; soluble NLGN3 was sufficient and necessary to promote robust HGG cell proliferation. NLGN3 induced PI3K pathway activity and feed-forward expression of NLGN3 in glioma cells, providing mechanistic insight into its surprising role as a mitogen. NLGN3 expression levels in human HGG negatively correlated with patient overall survival. These findings indicate the important role of active neurons in the brain tumor microenvironment and identify secreted neuroligin-3 as an unexpected mechanism promoting neuronal activity-regulated cancer growth. The proposed work aims to investigate further the direct interaction between NLNG3 and high-grade glioma cells. We will directly probe the necessity of NLGN3 in neuronal activity regulated glioma growth in an in vivo optogenetic model. Further, the research will identify mechanisms of secretion, receptor binding, and downstream signaling pathways. The proposed work highlights the previously under-recognized importance of neuronal activity in the glioma microenvironment, will result in a better mechanistic understanding of the newly identified glioma mitogen NLGN3, and may identify novel therapeutic targets to better treat these deadly brain tumors."
"9176805","Project Summary Clinical trials demonstrate that significant, sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in people with glaucoma is neuroprotective, slowing or halting vision loss, even in patients with normal-tension glaucoma. While the etiology of ocular hypertension in glaucoma is known to reside in the conventional outflow pathway, the cellular mechanisms responsible for generation of extra outflow resistance remain unknown. Yet, it seems likely that the homeostatic mechanisms regulating IOP, which presumably become defective in ocular hypertension, are similar to those involved in regulating blood pressure, including those affecting vascular tone. A key molecule is nitric oxide (NO), a free radical that is produced by vascular endothelia and acts as a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of contractility. Importantly, NO production by endothelia is regulated by shear stress. We demonstrated in our first funding period that IOP strongly influences the magnitude of shear stress within Schlemm's canal (SC), triggering release of NO from SC cells. We also showed that NO relaxes trabecular meshwork cells to decrease outflow resistance. Thus, shear-induced NO release acts within a dynamic ?feedback loop? that regulates conventional outflow resistance and IOP and appears compromised in some glaucomatous individuals. Our central hypothesis is that NO released from SC cells provides a mechanosensitive feedback signal that maintains IOP homeostasis, thereby functioning as an intraocular ?barostat?; and that directed therapeutic modulation of NO signaling in the glaucomatous outflow pathway significantly lowers IOP. During the first funding period, we discovered that additional factors, including oscillatory shear stress and trabecular meshwork (TM) stiffness, modulate the shear stress acting on SC cells, and hence influence their NO production. We also identified an additional NO target (distal vascular tone) in the conventional tract that lowers total outflow resistance. As a result, we extend our examination of NO signaling in the conventional outflow tract to test effects of oscillatory shear stress and TM stiffness on NO production and outflow resistance (Aim 1). Moreover, since 25-50% of total outflow resistance resides downstream of SC in distal vessels that are partly surrounded by NO-sensitive smooth muscle cells, we will determine the role of NO in regulating outflow resistance in the collector channels and intrascleral venous vessels in Aim 2. Knowing that NO is labile and needs close access to resistance generating regions in the conventional outflow tract, Aim 3 is designed to develop targeted NO- based therapeutics that increase conventional outflow at the level of the juxtacanalicular tissue, SC and/or distal vessels. This is critical because non-targeted NO delivery to the anterior segment is likely counter- productive by increasing episcleral venous pressure or relaxing ciliary muscle, both of which increase IOP. Our results will define the mechanisms of NO-mediated homeostasis in outflow regulation, uncover therapeutic targets for glaucoma therapy and generate novel technologies to modulate NO signaling and IOP."
"9319410","Project Summary The proposed research will develop novel methods to assess interactions between genetic and environmental exposures and different disease subtypes so as to better tailor treatments and prevention efforts to individuals? characteristics and so as to better understand the mechanisms governing disease. Methods will be developed for settings in which there are multiple disease subtypes and these disease subtypes may have different prognosis for survival and may be more amenable to different types of treatment and preventive efforts. Methodology for assessing the role of interaction in understanding mechanisms will also be developed. This will include elucidating the role of gene-environment interaction in the heritability of disease, understanding mediating pathways from exposure to disease in the presence of interaction, and identifying sufficient cause interaction for diseases or disease subtypes such that an outcome would occur if two (or more) exposures are present, but not if only one or the other were present. The methodology will be applied to understand prognosis, treatment decisions, preventive interventions, and mechanisms for colorectal cancer, and also for the development of skin lesions; the methodology will also be applied to understand the role of gene- environment interaction in the heritability of numerous traits."
"9235865","This application requests continued funding for the data management and biostatistical support for an international multicenter clinical trial comparing three different corticosteroid (CS) regimens for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This is a companion application to that of Kate Bushby, M.D. from the University of Newcastle (UK) and Robert C. Griggs, M.D. from the University of Rochester (USA) entitled ?FOR-DMD: Double-Blind Randomized Trial to Optimize Steroid Regimens in Duchenne MD.? The primary aim of this project is to conduct an international multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which 225 children with DMD between the ages of 4 and 7 will be randomized to receive either daily prednisone (0.75 mg/kg), daily deflazacort (0.90 mg/kg), or intermittent (10 days on, 10 days off) prednisone (0.75 mg/kg) and followed for a minimum of three years. The primary outcome variable will be three-dimensional and will consist of (1) time to stand from lying (log-transformed), (2) forced vital capacity, and (3) subject/parent global satisfaction with treatment, all averaged over all post-baseline visits during the three-year follow-up period. The trial will address the pragmatic hypothesis that daily prednisone and daily deflazacort will be of greater benefit in terms of function and subject/parent satisfaction than intermittent CS (prednisone) given over a three-year period. Currently, 174 participants (77%) are enrolled in the trial and recruitment is expected to be completed by September 2016. The specific aims of our application are (1) To provide data management for the trial including: implementation of web-based randomization and enrollment procedures, internet-facilitated entry of all study data into a standardized relational database, training of site personnel in the use of web-based applications for randomization and data entry, generation and resolution of data queries, monitoring of important study events, and maintenance of an appropriately secured and compliant network/database environment; and (2) To provide biostatistical support for the trial including: refinement and implementation of the statistical analysis plan to address the specific aims of the trial; implementation of an interim monitoring plan that will allow modification or termination of the study on the basis of early evidence of safety concerns, in conjunction with the NINDS-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB); and preparation of open- and closed-session reports for the DSMB."
"9270332","ABSTRACT An unanswered question of large public health importance for women living in settings with high HIV burden is whether the use of any hormonal contraceptive method, and injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) in particular, increases HIV risk. The objective of this proposal is to conduct biologic studies of the potential mechanisms by which hormonal contraceptives may render women more susceptible to HIV infection. A rigorous clinical trial, ?ECHO,? to definitively address the question of HIV acquisition risk with the use of contraceptives has just enrolled the first participants. In the trial, women are randomly assigned to use injectable DMPA, the levonorgestrel (LNG) contraceptive implant, or the non-hormonal T-380 copper intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD), equally effective contraceptive methods, positioning the trial to overcome many of the challenges that have plagued prior observational studies. Through the proposed work, we will enroll a comparable group of women using no contraception to serve as an additional control group. The trial does not include provisions to collect genital samples or conduct mechanistic studies. This proposal seizes an unprecedented opportunity to conduct studies nested within ECHO to test the most promising hypotheses about mechanisms by which hormonal contraceptives may increase HIV risk, including that hormonal contraceptives elicit: 1) increases in vaginal phylotypes associated with HIV risk, 2) increases in inflammation leading to HIV target cell recruitment or activation, 3) increases in target cell homing pathways, and/or 4) disruptions in mucosal barrier integrity. We will use state-of-the-art laboratory techniques ? including qPCR, 16S rRNA sequencing, flow cytometry, targeted and discovery mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and SmartSeq ? to achieve the study aims. The specific aims are to: 1) identify key vaginal phylotypes altered via initiation of hormonal contraceptives (DMPA versus copper IUD, DMPA versus no contraception, DMPA versus LNG implant, etc.) that mediate heightened susceptibility to HIV infection; 2) examine whether initiation of hormonal contraceptives elicits increased genital inflammation and HIV target cells and whether this correlates with increased HIV risk; and 3) determine whether initiation of hormonal contraceptives elicits increases in target cell homing pathways, as measured by the vaginal transcriptome, and/or decreases in epithelial integrity, as measured by secreted proteome, and whether these changes correlate with HIV infection. Finally, these large mucosal databases will be integrated with data-driven computational modeling to generate testable hypotheses about pathways leading to HIV infection. This study will identify mechanisms through which hormonal contraceptives alter genital mucosa, and may identify molecular and cellular biomarkers of increased mucosal HIV susceptibility. Results from this study will be pertinent for contraceptive recommendations for women with HIV risk. "

"9343085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application to PA-14-190 (Epidemiology and Prevention in Alcohol Research (R01)) continues research to reduce college students' alcohol use and consequences (R01AA012547; Larimer PI). Development of efficacious college drinking interventions is an important public health priority. Personalized feedback interventions (PFI), delivered via mail, internet, cell-phone, and text messaging, have evidence of efficacy but effects are small and variable across time and outcomes. Remote PFI delivery increases reach, but introduces barriers to efficacy, particularly variable attention to and comprehension of material. PFIs with multiple components delivered simultaneously may be overwhelming or confusing. This is problematic, as highly personalized feedback interventions with more components may produce larger and longer effects. In contrast, short-term efficacy of single-component PFIs (e.g., normative feedback) has been established, and these simpler PFIs may have more immediate impact; however, duration has been variable. Research is needed to determine optimal delivery to capitalize on clarity and initial impact of single-component and greater effect size and duration of multi-component PFIs. Duration may also be impacted by fluctuations in drinking during high- risk events. Moreover, PFI effects may be attenuated by timing of assessments relative to important high-risk events (e.g., New Year's eve falling within assessment of past month drinking), as well as time elapsed between PFI and specific events and if the PFI addressed the high-risk event. Providing boosters to address high-risk events, assessing drinking during these events and on typical occasions, and evaluating impact of intervention and assessment timing relative to high-risk events may help explain inconsistent findings regarding PFI effect size and duration. The current study addresses these gaps through evaluating a multi- component online PFI with simultaneous delivery (all PFI components at once) versus a sequential format, wherein individual PFI components are delivered one at a time to minimize attention demands for each component. The study seeks to enhance magnitude and duration of effects through adding text-message- based boosters to address specific high-risk events during the year following intervention. We will assess event-specific and typical drinking and consequences to evaluate immediate and sustained (through 24 months) changes in mediators and outcomes. Participants (N=1000 heavy drinking students) will be recruited in 4 cohorts corresponding with each quarter of the calendar year, and randomly assigned in a 2 (simultaneous versus sequential PFI) x 2 (boosters or no boosters) +1 (Assessment Only Control) longitudinal RCT design. Specific aims are: 1)Evaluate efficacy, moderators, and mediators of multi-component PFI, comparing simultaneous vs. sequential delivery vs. AOC; 2) Evaluate impact, mediators, and moderators of event-specific boosters on outcomes for both typical and event-specific drinking; 3) Evaluate timing of high-risk events relative to time since initial PFI and timing of longitudinal follow-up assessments on intervention efficacy."
"9327624","Project Summary This R01 project builds on a highly successful R21 project which involved the development and feasibility of a Minimally Invasive Neurosurgical Intracranial Robot (MINIR-I) using shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators as well as the evaluation of the device under continuous MRI for resection of an implanted ?metastatic tumor? in swine brain. While we achieved the specific aims of the R21 project, we also discovered new challenges, which are the basis for this R01 application. Brain tumors are among the most feared complications of cancer occurring in 20?40% of adult cancer patients. Despite numerous advances in treatment, the prognosis for these patients is poor, with a median survival of 4?8 months. Whether a primary (intrinsic) malignancy, or a secondary (metastatic) malignancy, involvement of the brain in a cancer patient is devastating, because it threatens the very personality and identity of the individual, and is invariably the most likely of all complications to directly and severely affect the quality of life. Currently, the optimal treatment for most brain tumors involves primary surgical resection to facilitate adjuvant therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, many patients cannot undergo primary surgical resection of their brain tumor due to unfavorable location of the lesion (usually deep or otherwise inaccessible to conventional neurosurgical techniques), and poor general health of the patient. To address this problem, based on the success of our R21 pilot project, and the lessons learned therein, we propose to develop a fully MRI-compatible MINIR-II and demonstrate the safety and efficacy of MINIR-II through comprehensive assessments on clinically relevant ex vivo and in vivo swine and followed by human cadaver models. As envisioned, MINIR-II will be under the direct control of the physician, with targeting information obtained exclusively from real-time MRI that uses active targeting methods with the sensors embedded within MINIR-II. To realize MINIR-II, we will address four specific aims: 1) Design a fully MRI compatible multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) MINIR-II of rigid plastic body with cable driven joints, hollow inner core for routing cabling and electronics, irrigation and suction capability, and tumor removal capability, 2) Develop and characterize a multi-piece mold capable of molding geometrically complex robot links with miniature features to produce a completely disposable/single use MINIR-II prototype, 3) Develop a tracking and navigation system for MINIR-II that will allow visualization of proximal and distal structures for accurate targeting and resection of the tumor, and finally 4) the safety and efficacy of MINIR-II in gelatin phantoms and clinically relevant models of metastatic brain tumor including, a cadaveric pig model, a live pig model, and a human cadaver model. Our goal at the end of this project is to have MINIR-II (operated under continuous MRI) ready for clinical trials."
"9348885","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reaching epidemic proportions, and in the absence of effective treatments, prevention strategies are needed. Accumulating evidence suggests that sleep plays an important role in regulating amyloid deposition, a hallmark of AD pathology. Both sleep disturbance and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a disorder characterized by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep and leading to hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation, are highly prevalent in AD and are associated with progression of AD pathology. Work from our group and others has shown that sleep disruption is associated with increased amyloid deposition in preclinical AD. Our group has pioneered the use of high density EEG (hdEEG, 256 channels) to demonstrate that sleep is not uniform throughout the brain, but is locally regulated and related to plastic changes during waking; different parts of the brain fall asleep at different times, such that certain brain regions may experience chronic deficits in local sleep. Further, this phenomenon has been shown by our group to occur in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, we have recently shown that OSA is associated with a local deficit in sleeping brain activity in the posterior cingulate region, in precisely the same area where peak amyloid deposition occurs in AD, suggesting a mechanism by which OSA exacerbates AD pathology. Our overarching research objective is to identify AD risk factors and mechanisms that can be modified in midlife to prevent or delay progression to AD. Sleep provides such a target. The 3 Specific Aims of this study are to determine over a 2 year period (1) the association of OSA with amyloid deposition and neural damage; (2) whether OSA treatment decreases progression of AD pathology and memory loss; and (3) the effect of local sleep deficits in the cingulate cortex on AD pathology and memory loss. The proposed study will clarify which aspects of OSA-apnea/hypopnea index, hypoxemia or sleep fragmentation-contribute to AD pathology and tests the novel hypothesis that OSA-related local sleep deprivation mediates AD progression. This study will add comprehensive imaging, sleep and activity recordings including hdEEG and amyloid-PET collection to the extensive battery of data already being collected in participants enrolled in the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, comprising a cohort of asymptomatic, middle-aged subjects (50-65 yrs) at risk for AD based on parental family history. The proposed study provides an unprecedented opportunity to assess the effects of OSA, sleep features, and treatment in a well characterized and longitudinally followed group of participants at increased risk for AD. Results will also provide valuable preliminary data for a large-scale pragmatic clinical trial to test the value of OSA screening and treatment to prevent progression of AD pathology in at-risk individuals."
"9152236","Project Summary Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by recurrent infections, hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmunity. Although the etiology of CVID is largely unknown, deleterious mutations in the lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) gene are associated with this syndrome. LRBA is a large intracellular adaptor protein (319 kD) localized to vesicular organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi complex, endocytic vesicles, and lysosomes. Although LRBA has been implicated in cell survival, proliferation, and autophagy, the precise function of LRBA in the endocytic pathway is unknown. LRBA has been recently shown to promote endosomal recycling of CTLA4, a potent inhibitory receptor expressed in T cells. LRBA-deficient patients expressed low levels of CTLA4 due to increased lysosomal degradation, and these patients exhibited marked improvement in inflammation and autoimmunity following treatment with CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) therapy. Importantly, abatacept did not improve immunoglobulin deficiency, suggesting a CTLA4-independent function of LRBA in humoral immunity. In support of this concept, B cells isolated from LRBA-deficient individuals failed to proliferate or secrete immunoglobulins in response to stimulation in vitro. Based on these findings, as well as data supporting LRBA in CTLA4 regulation, this application proposes that LRBA is a novel regulator of vesicular trafficking and promotes expression of key molecules required for the activation and function of B cells. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis in humans with loss-of-function mutations in LRBA. Specific Aim 1 will examine LRBA deficiency in B cell signal transduction and activation in vitro and in vivo, and Specific Aim 2 will use proteomic analyses to identify LRBA-regulated immunoreceptors required for B cell activation. Specific Aim 3 will identify the precise function of LRBA in the endocytic pathway by examining subcellular localization of LRBA, and the role of LRBA in synapse formation, vesicular transport and autophagy in B cells. Collectively, these studies will provide important insight into the immunoregulatory function of LRBA in B cells, which may lead to additional improvements in therapy for a severe form of immunodeficiency."
"9332744","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current treatment options for glioblastoma (GB) patients are limited and largely ineffective. The highly invasive nature of GB instills a high resistance to standard therapies and recurrence is virtually assured. The development of new therapeutic strategies coupled with increased selectivity of the treatments is essential for the management and enhanced survival of GB patients. This project brings together an existing team with expertise in biological target validation, high-throughput assay development, and molecular chemical libraries to target the TROY signaling pathway(s) as an innovative approach to treat GB invasion. We have developed cell-based assays for high throughput screening (HTS) to identify small molecule inhibitors of TROY dependent signaling. Our cell-based assay will interrogate both orthotopic and allosteric modulators that have functional consequences for TROY signaling. We will utilize resources available at the Prebys Center at Sanford- Burnham to perform a cell-based HTS in 1536-well format of the NIH's structurally diverse chemical library to identify drug-like compounds that inhibit the TROY signaling pathway. Selectivity profiles will be made using in- hand cell-based counterscreen assays. Hits will be further evaluated for biological effects in TROY-dependent glioma cell lines while not affecting TROY negative cells. Mechanism of action (MOA) studies will assess the impact of validated hits on the disruption of TROY oligomerization, TROY-TRAF2 interaction, and TROY- dependent intracellular signaling pathways. Finally, structure-activity relationship (SAR) by purchase of analogs of validated hit series will be performed along with supporting pharmacological characterization on the best available probe(s). Studies will emphasize the identification of high affinity small molecules with appropriate physicochemical properties to promote passage across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and delivery into the brain parenchyma. To capitalize on the strong biology/chemistry synergy among the assembled team of investigators with a goal to identify research tool compounds targeting TROY for future hit-to-lead optimization campaigns, the following Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Implement a cell-based reporter assay and perform a HTS of the NIH MLSMR >365,000 collection for modulators of the TROY signaling pathway; Aim 2: Confirm initial activity and validate hits for potency and selectivity/non-cytotoxicity with existing secondary cellular assays for TROY pathway dependence and general cytotoxicity; Aim 3: Perform a limited structure-activity relationship (SAR) elucidation through analogs by catalogs through the hit validation cascade of secondary assays to select the most potent and selective chemical probe; Aim 4: Perform functional biological assays and tertiary assays on validated scaffolds to elucidate the potential mechanisms of action and efficacy in inhibition of cellular migration, invasion, and resistance in clinically relevant primary GB cells; Aim 5: Perform limited ADME/T and in vitro BBB profiling on the most promising tractable probe(s) and scale up (25 - 50 mg) for a limited rodent PK study and future proof of concept and research studies."
"9162516","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Miocinovic is establishing herself as a physician-scientist conducting patient-centered research in the field of movement disorder electrophysiology and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This K23 will provide Dr. Miocinovic with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to gain knowledge in the use of advanced imaging techniques to visualize neural pathways in the human brain; (2) to become proficient in acquisition and analysis of intraoperative electrophysiology recordings; (3) to learn skills necessary to translate novel research methods into clinical practice; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Miocinovic has assembled a mentoring team consisting of a primary mentor: Dr. Philip Starr (a functional neurosurgeon with expertise in human movement disorders electrophysiology); two co-mentors: Dr. Jill Ostrem (a movement disorders neurologist with expertise in DBS management and clinical trials), and Dr. Pratik Mukherjee (a neuroradiologist with expertise in MRI tractography), and two collaborators: Dr. Cameron McIntyre (a biomedical engineer with expertise in computational modeling of DBS), and Dr. Alastair Martin (a medical physicist with expertise in MRI technology). The goal of the proposed research project is to understand which neural pathways are directly activated by DBS applied to the subthalamic area of patients with Parkinson's disease. This will be accomplished by measuring stimulation evoked potentials using a high- resolution subdural cortical recording strip, visualizing specific fiber pathways using MRI tractography and estimating the spread of stimulation effects using 3-dimensional biophysical computational models. The main focus is on the cortico-subthalamic hyperdirect pathway because of its potential importance in DBS therapeutic mechanism and accessibility for direct physiologic recordings. Aim 1: Dr. Miocinovic will determine how DBS parameter adjustments affect activation of the hyperdirect pathway using intraoperative cortical recordings. Aim 2: Dr. Miocinovic will validate the use of tractography-based, patient-specific computational models to predict preferential activation of the hyperdirect pathway. The ultimate goal of this project is to apply convergent methods to identify a target for subthalamic DBS in Parkinson's disease that achieves optimal therapeutic benefit. The proposed research is innovative because it utilizes electrocorticography to validate the use of tractography-based, patient-specific models for DBS parameter selection. Results from the proposed research will make significant contributions to our understanding of DBS mechanisms and advance methods for patient-specific DBS parameter selection, thus moving away from the trial-and-error approach currently used in clinical practice. Dr. Miocinovic's K23 training will prepare her to compete for R01 funding and translate these novel methods into clinical practice."

"9137498","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent and devastating chronic disease, affecting >29 million people in the United States (US). Health insurance and continued access to healthcare services are essential for optimal DM care and management; therefore, it is hypothesized that Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions could substantially improve access to health insurance and healthcare services for patients at risk for DM or already diagnosed with DM (`with DM risk or DM'). The ACA called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; little is yet known about the impact of ACA Medicaid expansion on the prevention, treatment, expenditures, and outcomes of patients with DM risk or DM. In a 2012 legal challenge, the US Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to implement ACA Medicaid expansions; thus (by January 1, 2015), 28 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid, while 22 states did not. This `natural experiment' presents a unique opportunity to learn whether and to what extent Medicaid expansion can affect healthcare access and services for patients with DM risk or DM. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to expand our understanding of how Medicaid expansion impacts DM prevention, treatment, expenditures, and health outcomes. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 470 CHCs in 12 Medicaid expansion states and 248 CHCs in 9 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance, service receipt, and health outcomes, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. Moreover, building on our prior work, we will link EHR data from 213 Oregon ADVANCE CHCs to Oregon Medicaid claims data to assess Medicaid expenditures among patients with DM risk or DM. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare pre-post insurance status, overall visits, and chronic disease management visits among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 2. Compare pre- post receipt of primary and secondary DM preventive services (e.g., screening for obesity, lipid levels, glycosylated hemoglobin) among patients with DM risk or DM, in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 3. Compare pre-post changes in DM-related biomarkers (e.g., body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels) in patients with DM risk or DM among newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-period), and continuously uninsured (pre- and post-period) patients in states that expanded Medicaid. Aim 4. Measure pre-post changes in Oregon Medicaid expenditures among newly insured compared to already insured patients with DM risk or DM. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice, informing further improvements in the US healthcare system to ensure access for vulnerable populations and mitigate disparities in DM prevention, treatment, and health outcomes."
"9178889","Project Summary ? Technical Mouse and human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state with a combination of four transcription factors. This induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell has unquestionable clinical potential. However, adult cells must first be completely de-differentiated to an embryonic stem (ES) cell-like state, and then subsequently re-differentiated to an adult cell-type of interest---a time-consuming and inefficient detour. We have successfully generated human neural stem cells (NSCs) directly from adult fibroblasts and olfactory epithelial cells. We propose to utilize the human NSCs to regenerate damaged brain tissue. We will use a radiation treatment (RT) for lethal brain tumor, glioblastoma multiform (GBM), as a model system. GBM patients receive RT, however, tumors always recur. The cognitive dysfunctions after irradiation affect patient's quality of life. We hypothesize that higher doses of irradiation will prevent recurrence, and cognitive dysfunctions after the aggressive RT can be prevented by regeneration of damaged tissues by human NSCs. NSCs generated from adult cells are no tumorigenic unlike ESCs and iPSs. Therefore, this proposed strategy has great potential to successfully treat brain damage with low risk and low cost."
"9133163","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease as result of metabolic syndrome continues to be a major health burden worldwide, regardless of the numerous available therapeutic strategies. Derangements in systemic energy homeostasis are the result of metabolic dysfunction within individual tissues as well as in defective communication between tissues. Understanding metabolic coordination within a particular tissue and throughout the body will lead to new and improved therapeutic avenues. We recently uncovered an important role of the heart in systemic energy homeostasis, thus establishing the precedent that the heart is capable of intertissue metabolic communication to elicit fuel partitioning between tissues globally. However, the molecular details of the signals emanating from the heart and the role of this cardiometabolic axis in disease are unexplored. We have identified 2 uncharacterized muscle-specific lipid reductase enzymes capable of generating metabolites that could confer the heart this ability. In the first aim of this proposal, we will interrogate the functions of each of  these enzymes in cardiomyocytes using gain- and loss-of-function animal models. The final aim of this proposal will test the role of each lipid reductase in mediating inter-tissue communication  from myocytes to other tissues of the body. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the heart signals to other tissues by secreting lipid-derived metabolites that act as signaling effectors, with the prediction that we will uncover novel ways in which striated muscles communicate to other tissues. Overall, these studies will provide new insights into myocyte endocrine signaling and the regulation of systemic energy metabolism by striated muscle and may yield novel therapeutic strategies for modulating these processes in the settings of cardiometabolic disease."
"9242811","Project Summary/Abstract Age-onset diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and osteoporosis are generating a public health burden that is quickly becoming insurmountable. Exacerbating this problem, co-morbidities are common among the elderly. The ideal therapeutic strategy to confront this crisis is to target a unifying risk factor, but patient age is the only risk factor common to all these diseases. Fortunately, it is increasingly clear that the biological processes of aging are malleable, thus the rate and quality of aging may be improved. Genetic and nutritional interventions causing real or perceived energy- depletion are robust, conserved mechanisms to promote healthier aging. Unfortunately these interventions, e.g. activation of the molecular low-energy sensor AMPK, also carry clinically unacceptable side effects, such as suppressed immunity and fertility. Translating these findings into therapeutics thus requires identification of downstream mechanisms that are sufficient for healthier aging. Through a genetic model of longevity in C. elegans via activation of AMPK, we demonstrated that the negative side-effects of energy-depletion can be uncoupled from the positive effects on healthy aging. Using unbiased, systems-level approaches, we found that the longevity-specific mechanism involves downstream regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic functions, and we now demonstrate that regulation of mitochondrial dynamics is causal to AMPK longevity. New data indicate that perturbing the unfolded protein response (UPR), which mediates homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), interacts with the AMPK pathway to extend lifespan through a mechanism that also requires mitochondrial remodeling. Given recent studies showing that the ER physically interacts with mitochondria to regulate organelle morphology and metabolic signaling, these data suggest a new paradigm in aging: ER/mitochondrial regulation of longevity occurs through an integrated metabolic mechanism. Physical changes in mitochondrial networks are a hallmark of aging, but how organelle dynamics are mechanistically involved in longevity is unknown. By genetically inactivating mediators of mitochondrial remodeling (fission/fusion), Aim 1 will define how mitochondrial dynamics drive the changes in mitochondrial metabolism associated with low-energy longevity. Through novel transgenics and training in high-resolution microscopy in Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that UPRER perturbations promote altered mitochondrial morphology and signaling between organelles. Finally in the R00 phase, Aim 3 will build on the tools and insights developed in Aims 1 and 2 to identify genetic mechanisms in C. elegans by which ER-mitochondrial inter-organelle communication can be directly targeted to extend healthy lifespan and protect metabolic homeostasis. Taken together, the goal of this proposal is to identify how evolutionarily conserved energy-sensing pathways coordinately modulate inter-organelle signaling and metabolic function to promote longevity."
"9071970","SUMMARY ? PROJECT 3: MITF IN DRUG RESISTANCE AND METABOLISM IN MELANOMA  Long Term Objective: The long-term objective of this study is too understand how stress from the tumor  microenvironment, and from treatment with drug, alter melanoma cell phenotype and lead to a drug resistant  and invasive phenotype. The study seeks to identify new leverage points that can be targeted to develop new  drugs.  The Unmet Medical Need: Estimates by the American Cancer Society (ACS) predict that in 2013 close to  80,000 new melanoma cases were diagnosed in the US, and almost 10,000 people were expected to die from  the disease. Unlike many other cancers, melanoma occurs in all age groups, and is one of the most common  malignancies in adults under 40. There is a pressing unmet medical need for new therapies to treat melanoma,  especially because patients treated with BRAF inhibitors experience only short term benefit, the vast majority  ultimately relapse as the tumor becomes resistant to drug.  The Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis of the study is that adaptation two types of stress, (i) nutrient  deprivation and (ii) and BRAF inhibition, evoke related molecular and metabolic adaptations in melanoma that  lead to an invasive, tumor-initiating and drug-resistant phenotype.  We pose two questions as Specific Aims: (1) What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of  phenotypically invasive, tumor-initiating or drug-resistant melanoma cells by the ATF4-MITF axis? (2) What  metabolic changes accompany acquisition of tolerance to nutrient deprivation and resistance to BRAFi?  The Research Team: The Project Leader and co-I are uniquely qualified to conduct the studies. Dr. Colin  Goding is Professor at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and Co-Director, Oxford Stem Cell Institute at  the University of Oxford. Dr. Goding is one of the internationally recognized thought leaders in the field of  melanoma. Dr. Jeffrey W. Smith has led a research team focused on defining central carbon metabolism in  cancer for the past decade. The team's primary strategy has been to use isotopic tracers to quantify metabolic  flux, a direct measure of activity of metabolic pathways. In collaboration with Dr. Andrei Osterman (leader of  Core B), the group has published six key papers that lay the foundation for understanding regulation of  melanoma cell metabolism. Work proposed in this project will closely integrate with studies outlined in Project 1  (UPR), Project 2 (PGC1) as with the two scientific Cores."

"9078434","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 60% of women will suffer from a urinary tract infection (UTI) at some point in their lives and a third of women with an acute UTI will suffer recurrent UTIs. This disease is especially problematic for post- menopausal women where over 50% will have recurrent infections that cannot be cured with antibiotics. This increased susceptibility is likely due to reduced estrogen levels that accompany aging. However, the mechanisms behind this increased susceptibility are unknown, and this lack of knowledge impedes our ability to develop new strategies for the treatment and prevention of UTIs, especially in post-menopausal women. Here, we focus on the cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is rapidly upregulated during UTIs in humans, and multiple studies have shown that postmenopausal women have elevated serum levels of IL-6. Recent studies indicate that IL-6 signaling not only modulates innate immune responses but also is essential for timely wound healing and tissue regeneration. In preliminary studies, we demonstrate that loss of IL-6 impairs the host response to UPEC and that aged female mice exhibit high levels of IL-6, increased recruitment of macrophages, and impaired tissue repair. Our objective here is to determine how balance is achieved between 1) activating the innate immune system (macrophages) to destroy the pathogen (predominantly uropathogenic E. coli [UPEC]) and 2) repairing the bladder epithelium. We will test the central hypothesis that IL-6 is a key regulator of the balance between host defense and epithelial homeostasis. In Aim 1, we will dissect the function of IL-6 signaling in modulating the immune and epithelial response to a UTI and how loss of function of this protein impairs host defense response. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms whereby aging influences UTI outcome in mice and women. Importantly, we will leverage our mechanistic insights to determine whether selective estrogen receptor agonists or anti-IL6 therapies will be effective treatments. We anticipate that our work will provide new insights into the molecular interplay between estrogen and bladder host defense during a UTI. In addition, the experiments will provide a foundation upon which to determine whether estrogen and anti-IL-6 therapies will be effective interventions in post-menopausal women suffering from chronic, recurrent UTIs and will help to develop preventive interventions and treatments that are optimized for menopausal women."
"9082246","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco-based products. However, the FDA only recently proposed deeming regulations on e-cigarettes. Since their market emergence, e-cigarettes have evolved from first generation products, which look like a conventional cigarette, have few design components and limited nicotine delivery, to second generation products, which do not look like conventional cigarettes, have multiple design components and can achieve cigarette-like levels of nicotine-delivery. Missing from the current literature is a prospective study assessing differences between these two major types of e-cigarettes on smoking behaviors and patterns, nicotine dependence, and on biomarkers of toxicant exposure and effect. Understanding the differential impact of first versus second generation e-cigarettes on smoking as well as measures of proximal health outcomes will help immediately inform the science base needed for the FDA to impose appropriate product specific regulations. The overall aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the effect of switching from conventional cigarettes to either a first or second generation e-cigarette on smoking behavior, product use patterns and continued use, as well as biomarkers of toxicant exposure and effects. To do so, we will randomly assign 453 adult smokers, naïve to e-cigarette use, to first generation e-cigarette (G1), second generation e-cigarette (G2), or usual brand cigarette control (UBC). All products will be provided for 12 weeks. Enrollment will be restricted only to smokers not planning to quit in the next 3 months. Prior to randomization, all participants will take part n a lead-in period to assess normal smoking behavior and to allow for stratification on important variables. Follow- ups will occur at 1, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Our specific aims are to 1) assess the effect of provision of G1 vs. G2 on product switching, abuse liability, number of cigarettes smoked, and perceived nicotine dependence; 2) evaluate changes in biomarkers of harmful tobacco constituent exposure among participants assigned to G1, G2, and UBC; and 3) evaluate changes in biomarkers of toxicant effect among participants assigned to G1, G2, and UBC. This innovative study in its comprehensive examination of all e-cigarette devices as well as their impact on smoking behavior and health outcomes, will provide the scientific foundation the FDA and other agencies need to establish effective regulatory strategies for the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of e- cigarettes."
"9235769","Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains a major cause of HIV-related mortality in Africa. Successful management of Cryptococcus in resource-limited areas is often hindered by unsatisfactory or unavailable antifungal regimens. In these settings, treatment failure and relapse are common. Furthermore, widespread availability of ART has led to changes in the meningitis epidemiology in Africa. Persons with cryptococcal meningitis now have more complex disease presentations, with 40-50% presenting while receiving ART. Large knowledge gaps exist in the diagnosis and management of increasing proportions of complex patients, in particular those developing cryptococcal meningitis shortly after initiating ART, second episodes due to paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with sterile CSF, or second episodes of culture-positive relapse.  This mentored international research project is a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected Africans with Cryptococcus in Uganda. The candidate will determine if persons who develop cryptococcal meningitis while already receiving ART will have worse outcomes compared to ART-naïve persons in a resource-limited area. The candidate will evaluate whether differential outcomes based on ART status are dependent on expression of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Specifically, the candidate will assess whether persons receiving effective ART will have inflammatory patterns of biomarker expression in CSF. Finally, in cases of recurrent symptomatic meningitis, the candidate will evaluate the role of novel laboratory techniques and biomarkers as more sensitive indicators of infection for rapid differentiation of paradoxical IRIS from culture-positive relapse.  Dr. Rhein's long-term career goal is to become an independent translational global health researcher who bridges the gap between basic science and clinical research, moving basic science concepts to clinical application in resource-limited settings. During his training to date, Dr. Rhein has spent 4 years on the ground in Kampala, Uganda working on cryptococcal meningitis research. This K01 award will provide for mentored career development using a combination of coursework to supplement current knowledge gaps and practical mentored-research experience to build a strong foundation of laboratory research skills in HIV immunology and CNS pathogenesis. The award will build upon existing international collaborations and help the candidate develop experience in clinical trial design and implementation in an international setting."
"9177735","Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), burdens more women than men and affect millions of aging Americans and their families. While the search for effective prevention continues, scientific evidence on modifiable risk factors for dementia remains uncertain. In the last two decades, compelling data have documented significant neurotoxicity in animals and humans exposed to ambient air pollutants. Toxicopathological studies show evidence of accelerated brain aging (e.g., ?-amyloid accumulation) and possible neurodegeneration (e.g., neuro-fibrillary tangles). Although epidemiologic data also support that ambient air pollutants may represent a novel and modifiable environmental determinant of pathological brain aging, the proposed longitudinal study will address the following critical knowledge gaps. First, convincing prospective cohort data linking ambient air pollution to increased dementia risks are still lacking. Second, most published air pollution-neuroepidemiologic studies were studying late-life (aged > 65) exposures; whether/how exposures before late life shape the profile of neuropsychological functions and determine the subsequent risk for dementia has not been studied. Third, mechanistic mediators underlying the adverse effects and human brain structures perturbed by air pollutants remain elusive. Fourth, very little is known about the PM exposure sources/compositions affecting brain aging. Specifically, this application is built on two well-characterized and geographically-diverse cohorts of postmenopausal and older women participating in Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Memory Study (WHIMS;1995-2007; n=7479, aged 65-80) and WHIMS of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y; n=1326, aged 50-55) since 1996. Supported by the preliminary results and drawing on the extended follow-up of WHIMS+ WHIMS-Y, we will update the neurocognitive outcome database (dementia subtype; annual neuropsychological assessment; structural brain MRI) until 2016. This application also leverages recent advances in spatiotemporal modeling to enrich the residential exposure database for NO2/ozone/PM10 (1993- 2016 monthly) and PM2.5 (1993-1999 yearly; 1999-2016 monthly). In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of long-term exposures on dementia/AD incidence. Aim 2 will examine the adverse effects of air pollution on latent trajectories of internally validated neuropsychological biomarkers, putatively associated with estimated exposures starting at age of 50-55 and continuing into later life. In Aim 3, we will use structural equation models to evaluate the hypothesized mediation by emotional disturbance, reduced limbic brain volume, and increased neurovascular damages underling the neurotoxic effects of air pollution. In Aim 4, we will explore the associations between PM exposure sources/compositions and brain aging. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team working together on this emerging field of environmental neurosciences in brain aging. Expected new knowledge gained from this R01 will greatly improve our understanding of the role of air pollution in contributing to neuropsychological processes and mechanisms of dementia/AD in late life."
"9128625","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Better Understanding of the Neuroprotective Mechanisms of Korean Ginseng in Stroke It has been postulated that the determinants of neuronal cell death in acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions are mediated by free radical damage. Ginseng has been reported to be neuroprotective and a potential preventive medicine, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are still unclear. Our preliminary results prompted us to focus our attention on Korean Ginseng and test the hypothesis that the transcriptional factor Nrf2 could participate in the overall Ginseng's neuroprotective function. HO, which cleaves heme (a prooxidant) to form biliverdin/bilirubin (antioxidants), carbon monoxide (a vasodilator), and iron (a prooxidant) has been shown to play a protective role in oxidative stress, ischemia, inflammation, and hypertension. Although HO2 is constitutively expressed, HO1 is inducible. Consequently, a possible way to increase HO levels to achieve neuroprotection may be to induce HO1. Of the compounds tested in our preliminary experiments in primary neuronal cultures, Ginseng was one of the most potent HO1 inducers. Our results also indicate that pretreatment of neurons with Ginseng is sufficient to provide neuroprotection, suggesting that co-treatment during oxidative stress is not necessary. This neuroprotective effect was abolished by a protein synthesis inhibitor, and was greatly reduced by an HO inhibitor. These preliminary results implied that specific induction of HO1 could be a mechanism by which Ginseng exerts its preventive neuroprotective actions and motivated us to propose that some of the neuroprotective effects attributed to Ginseng could be mediated through HO1 induction and the associated beneficial actions of heme degradation. Recently, we and others have described Nrf2 has as a key regulator of inflammation and redox homeostasis. In Aim 1, we will determine anatomical and behavioral outcomes following ischemia in wild type mice pre-treated (acutely or chronically) with Ginseng, determine whether the beneficial effect is sustained with aging, and test whether these effects are attenuated in Nrf2 knockout mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether Ginseng induced characteristic changes in brain cells, and start addressing in which cell types these Nrf2 changes occurs. Together, these in vivo results will help us determine whether oral consumption of a standardized Ginseng extract could be beneficial, and which cells can be most associated with the Ginseng preventive brain mechanistic pathways by which Ginseng would provide the cell/brain with resistance to acute debilitating neurodegenerative conditions."
"9212436","Project Summary/Abstract This application is intended to support funding for three future meetings of the Quality & Patient Safety TAG as part of the World Health Organization's ongoing development of the International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition. The group has worked horizontally across all ICD-11 chapters to advise the WHO on optimizing the entire content and structure of the classification system to better capture important concepts relevant to measuring health system quality and safety and was able to provide significant contributions to the revision process across all TAGs as reflected in the beta-version of ICD 11 (made available to the public in May 2012). Future work of the Q&S TAG will seamlessly take up on previously conducted conferences and will focus on the following five aims:  I. The first aim is to enhance the capacity of ICD to capture information related to quality and safety to  facilitate quality monitoring and improvement in the US and internationally through continuing review  and refinement of the ICD-11 beta-draft including vertical chapter content and alphanumeric coding  schemes from the perspective of the quality and safety use case (e.g., codes for Beta Joint Linearization).  II. Secondly, the proposed work aims to ensure continuing coordination between AHRQ's Patient Safety  Formats and ICD-11, particularly harmonizing patient safety clinical definitions, related terminology and  future code development; and aligning both systems to support adverse event reporting, surveillance,  use of electronic health.  III. The third aim is to enhance collaborative activities between the US, the WHO and other countries with  particular focus on further refinement of morbidity and mortality coding rules to improve data  comparability; review of field trials for ICD-11 designed and run by members of the Q&S TAG; and  assessment of potential uses of ICD-11 for health services, comparative effectiveness, quality  improvement, and patient centered outcomes research.  IV. Furthermore, the Quality & Patient Safety TAG aims to explore potential US application of new ICD-11  concepts introduced by Q&S TAG for ICD-10 CM.  V. The fifth and final aim is to encourage effective coordination in the implementation of ICD 11 and AHRQ  Patient Safety Formats and other US and WHO efforts to compile and use quality and patient safety data. The ultimate objective of the Q&S TAG's work is an enhanced international classification system that will permit expanded use of coded health data for large scale quality and safety surveillance in health care systems in the US and internationally and facilitation of health services research and patient centered outcomes research using large scale data sets. Conferences of the Q&S TAG not only provide an important platform for advancing the Q&S TAG's work with regard to developing ICD-11 but support and enhance knowledge translation and exchange among a broader audience of international coding experts and health services researchers through dissemination and publication of the groups work in scientific journals and postings on IMECCHI's website."

Investigators in the Department of Ophthalmology recently completed a 5-year infrastructure grant (R24) that supported ocular surface research on our campus. The infrastructure grant was enormously successful and fostered new collaborations and culminated in 69 publications in peer-review journals. We recently received a one-year P30 Core Grant through the ARRA. This unique one-year award has fostered further collaborations among vision researchers from the Departments of Ophthalmology, Psychiatry,   Physiology, Neuroscience, and the Center for Developmental Biology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. We have also initiated a number of vision-related projects and seminar series that have enriched vision research activities on this campus. This, along with the acquisition of additional NEl-supported research, prompted us to submit a 5-year P30 Core Grant application to enhance and expand research efforts that rely on three common technologies: 1) tissue culture/hybridoma; 2) imaging; and 3) protein biochemistry and virus-mediated gene transfer. Significant institutional support in the form of additional laboratory space, endowed scholars' awards, and intramural research awards has provided a fertile ground for expansion and enhancement of vision research on our campus. The proposed Core Grant for Vision Research will further this effort and enhance vision research at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center."
"9247669","Project Summary Social isolation (SI) predicts morbidity and mortality from a multitude of health conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. Patients with high levels of social support or large social networks exhibit more rapid and extensive functional recovery after stroke than socially isolated individuals, and the impact of these factors appears to be greater in elderly women. Social interaction overcomes the detrimental effects of SI by promoting adaptive behaviors and favorable neuroendocrine responses to biological stressors. Despite the huge impact of SI on post-stroke recovery, no study has attempted to mitigate the detrimental effects of isolation on neurobehavioral outcomes using target-based approaches. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that are emerging as a powerful intervention tool for many diseases including stroke. They regulate a broad spectrum of biological pathways through fine-tuning of protein expression levels and altering gene expression levels. They have the ability to concurrently target multiple effectors of pathways involved in disease pathology. Very recent studies have found that microRNAs mediate many aspects of social interaction, leading us to hypothesize that miRNA regulation is involved in post-stroke pathology after SI. Preliminary studies have found that expression of several miRNAs including miR-181c-5p and miR-124-5p, which are involved in regulation of inflammation, long term potentiation and neurotrophin signaling, are modulated by post-stroke isolation in aged mice. In this proposal we will determine which miRNAs are differentially expressed in aged male and female mice isolated after stroke and determine if blocking (with genetic deletion or antagomirs) or enhancing (mimics) these target miRNA modulates their effects. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine if manipulation of target miRNAs can improve functional recovery after stroke in aged animals subjected to SI, a major risk factor for poor recovery."
"9170232","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a significant contributor to global morbidity and mortality and is the primary cause of disability worldwide. Depression accounts for the majority of suicides and also a considerable portion of heart disease. Living in urban settings  has been linked to an increased risk of depression and other mental illnesses in numerous studies; however findings have varied and the mechanisms are not well understood. A number of possible contributing factors have been suggested, one being a reduction in social cohesion and social support in urban environments. Older adults are an age group that is more vulnerable to depression, which may be due in part to their greater likelihood of being socially isolated. As the world's population continues to age and with increasing urbanization in low- and middle-income countries, depression is likely to become a growing problem. Using data from African countries participating in the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE), the proposed research therefore seeks to explore the relationship between urbanicity, social connections, and depression among older adults. The study will specifically examine the association between current urban residence and depression and determine whether social cohesion and support explain this association. It will also assess whether urban residence across the life course and at different life stages is associated with depression. Lastly, it will determine whether the relationship between social support and depression varies across urban and rural locations. These aims will be studied through quantitative analyses involving modeling with latent variable and multilevel methods. The proposed research will provide training in advanced analytic techniques and aging-related mental health issues and will support the NIA's Initiative on Global Aging through cross-national research. Results of the study will contribute to understanding the social and contextual determinants of depression in older adults. It will also have important implications for individual and community-level interventions to address late life depression, as well as implications for urban planning policy to promote mental health and for the allocation of mental health resources across urban and rural areas."
"9343288","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in 5 persons in poverty is a child <18 years, and this number is growing, especially in the South. Further, 40% of African American and 34% of Hispanic children <18 years live in low-income households, and 55% of poor rural African-American children have less access to health services. Since a majority of public school students are from low-income families in both the South and West, public schools present an opportunity to reach underserved populations on-site with quality healthcare services. For > 2 decades model School-based Health Centers (SBHCs) have been tested to meet health needs of disparity population, but less than 1% of public elementary schools house SBHCs. Four issues must be addressed in taking SBHCs to scale: sustainability, evidence of community need and support, evidence of health and health cost impact, and fidelity to exemplar models. The ongoing Georgia SBHC Project provides operational solutions to the first two issues. The goal of the proposed study, EPOCH (Evaluating Processes and Outcomes for Children), will take advantage of an opportunity to conduct a natural experiment that will assess the ability of this approach to solve the other two issues. We will examine the effects of expanding SBHCs across three public elementary school sites in Georgia that differ by environment (rural, small city, and suburban) and race / ethnicity (one each being predominantly African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white children). A specific focus will be the effects of SBHCs on improved access to primary care and, in turn, on the level of health outcomes including obesity, uncontrolled asthma, and Emergency Department and hospital utilization and costs to the Medicaid program. We will conduct a year-by-year comparison of health indicators and health care costs for children with and without access to SBHCs. In a novel approach to evaluating SBHCs, we will conduct a full-scale process and outcome evaluation, following the Implementation Fidelity model proposed by Carroll, et al., and modified by Hasson. This will include active monitoring to measure program adaptations, secondary analysis of SBHCs' benchmarking, schools' routine FitnessGrams and absenteeism statistics, and by linking children enrolled in an SBHC to their Medicaid claims records. This quasi-experimental, longitudinal study will include 7 years' data (3 pre-, 1 during, and 3 post-SBHC implementation) for the 3 SBHC schools and 3 similar, non-SBHC schools. Additionally, Medicaid data will be extracted for children living in the 6 schools' zip codes to conduct utilization and cost analyses on improving specific health outcomes (e.g., asthma and obesity) and reducing health disparities in rural and minority populations. The EPOCH study offers an opportunity to create a new evidence base for the role of SBHCs in states without the Medicaid expansion. Comprehensive SBHCs may have greater importance there because of the lack of alternatives for children to access free or subsidized health care. These findings will also inform the nation as it considers reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015."
"9124754","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum breast cancer, defined as the diagnosis of breast cancer within 5 years of pregnancy, has a 3-fold increased risk for distant recurrence and mortality. A postpartum diagnosis is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, isolating the postpartum window from potential tumor promotional attributes of pregnancy. The postpartum mammary gland undergoes involution to return the lactation-competent gland to a non-secretory state. In rodent models, postpartum involution is tumor-promotional due to tissue remodeling and macrophage infiltration. Unknown is whether the postpartum period also exhibits stromal remodeling at secondary sites, which could increase metastasis. The question of whether normal physiologic tissue remodeling occurs in organs besides the mammary gland in the postpartum period, and escalates breast cancer metastasis, has not been previously explored. My novel observation that macrophages infiltrate the postpartum liver, reminiscent of mammary gland involution, suggests that postpartum liver tissue remodeling establishes a pro-metastatic microenvironment during weaning-induced involution. The hypothesis that macrophage infiltration in the postpartum liver establishes a pro-metastatic microenvironment that supports breast cancer metastasis; and further, that prophylactic treatment with NSAIDs reduces the pro-metastatic attributes of the regressing liver as well as liver metastases, will be tested. Aim 1 will determine the extent of macrophage infiltration into the liver during involution including a characterization of the pro-tumor immunosuppressive differences of macrophages in the postpartum liver compared to nulliparous controls. The contribution of infiltrating macrophages to liver involution and the postpartum pro-metastatic microenvironment will be evaluated using a conditional macrophage-depletion mouse model. Aim 2a will test if mammary tumor cell metastasis is increased in the postpartum period using murine models of metastatic postpartum breast cancer. Aim 2b will test if liver metastasis is increased in University of Colorado postpartum breast cancer patients when compared to their nulliparous breast cancer peers. Aim 3 will determine if treatment with NSAIDs in our murine model of postpartum breast cancer decreases the pro-metastatic attributes of the postpartum liver and reduces liver metastasis. This work will further contribute to our understanding of the postpartum period as a window of risk for metastatic breast cancer by investigating the role of the liver pro-metastatic microenvironment. The proposal aims to identify novel treatment options for young women at risk for postpartum breast cancer. The project's progression will be frequently assessed by the Schedin lab research team and collaborators with complimentary expertise in basic science and clinical fields. To accomplish these aims, proficiency in flow cytometric, histologic, & macrophage functional assays, use of transgenic, metastasis, and treatment murine models, as well as human clinical databases will advance the student's scientific breadth to better understand human postpartum breast cancer."

Further, mutations from autosomal dominant AD have provided animal and cellular models that are utilized to develop anti-A? drugs. Due to the rarity of autosomal dominant AD, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN; U01 AG032438) was launched in 2008 to establish an international, multicenter registry of individuals at risk or with a known causative mutation of AD in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), or presenilin 2 (PS2) genes. DIAN evaluates participants at entry and longitudinally thereafter with clinical and cognitive batteries, structural, functional, metabolic,and amyloid imaging protocols, and biological fluid (blood; cerebrospinal fluid) collection with the goal of determining the sequence of imaging and biomarker changes in presymptomatic gene carriers who are destined to develop AD. Because the clinical and pathological phenotypes of dominantly inherited AD appear similar to those for the far more common late-onset sporadic AD, the nature and sequence of brain changes in dominantly inherited AD are also likely relevant for sporadic AD. The trial design is a randomized, blinded placebo controlled four arm trial of a fibrillar anti-A? antibody, a soluble anti-A? antibody, and a beta-secretase inhibitor i 160 (n=40 per arm) asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic ADAD mutation carriers. Subjects will receive either drug of placebo for two years to determine engagement of the CNS mechanism of action and downstream AD biomarkers."
"9203456","ABSTRACT  The goal of our proposal is to define the impact of premature aging in HIV seropositive subjects on the human eye. Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically improved the life expectancy of HIV+ subjects. Research indicates that HIV+ subjects experience age-related changes 10-15 years earlier than age-matched HIV- peers. The human retina offers a unique window into a section of the central nervous system (CNS). Currently, there is no biomarker for monitoring the effect of aging on the CNS. The secondary goal is the development of a surrogate biomarker in the eye for CNS damage. In this proposal we will use adaptive optical (AO) imaging to document cone photoreceptor density and retinal vascular morphometry. Our preliminary data suggests that HIV+ subjects have lower cone photoreceptor density. Other evidence indicates that changes to the microvasculature may be age-related. We will additionally acquire non-invasive vascular parameter using OCT angiography and metabolic data through lifetime fluorescence measurement in the eye (FLIO). We will use Carotid intima-media thickness as a cardiovascular surrogate biomarker. In addition, we will have access to other putative measures of biological aging (telomere length, mitochondrial common deletion, end-products of oxidative stress and DNA methylation) through the collaboration with the HNRC. By combining AO imaging, OCT angiography, and FLIO with our established structural data (SD-OCT, etc.) and putative measures of aging we can study the impact of premature aging on the eye. The data will be correlated with neurobehavioral, immunological and medical data collected by our collaborators at the HNRC. We plan to develop clinical reliable evaluation tools for risk assessment of premature aging. We will determine the prognostic capabilities of these evaluation tools with the help of biostatistical modeling."
"9242305","Herpes Simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) causes human specific infections in the form of recurrent cold sores and corneal keratitis, and even blindness with periods of latency in neurons that serve as reservoirs of lifelong infection. The infection is age dependent, with exposure rates exceeding 70% in older US adults. HSV-1 encephalitis is rare, but it can be fatal. Though currently available treatments (e.g., acyclovir / valacylovir) are efficacious for acute HSV1-induced lytic infections, they do not eliminate latent infections. Most of our knowledge regarding HSV-1 latency comes from small animal models, which are not naturally infected by HSV-1. Furthermore, these animal models do not fully recapitulate the species-specific effects of human HSV- 1 infection. Published human models have relied largely on neurons derived from human neoplastic cells, but they may not fully reflect the global mRNA expression profile of normal human neurons. Recently, human fetal dorsal root ganglion cells have been employed, but the difficulty in obtaining aborted fetuses limit their use. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to generate unlimited supplies of human neurons and the facility to manipulate such cells in vitro. We have developed an in vitro HSV-1 infection model in human iPSC-derived neurons (hiPSCs-neurons) that displays acute lytic infection as well as quiescent infection with features similar to the animal models. Our method to differentiate human neurons from iPSCs is robust, and it enables in a cost effective way, an adequate number of cells required for chromatin analysis. The central tenet of this proposal is that an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms HSV-1 infection in human cells will highlight the pathways for the development of drugs with highest therapeutic efficacy. We will employ our iPSC-based in vitro human model of HSV-1 infection to investigate aspects of the heterochromatinization of viral episomes during quiescence and to characterize HSV-1 miRNAs. In the Aim 1 of this proposal, we will perform chromatin analysis of HSV-1 genomes in acutely and latently infected hiPSCs-neurons. In the Aim 2, we will characterize HSV-1 miRNAs in HSV-1 infected human neurons, investigate their functions, and identify their human RNA targets. The anticipated outcomes from this proposal are: (i) improved understanding of human neuronal responses to lytic and quiescent HSV-1 infection; (ii) identification of targets that will ultimately pave the way for the identification effective anti-viral drugs with a novel mechanism of action."
"9210975","Summary The ORCATECH Collaborative Aging (in Place) Research Using Technology (CART) program develops and validates an infrastructure for rapid and effective conduct of research utilizing technology to facilitate aging in place (AiP). CART is a unique and innovative research organization to enjoin expert leaders from academia and industry with broad-based experience across multiple fields: gerontology, clinical medicine, health care, psychology, user interaction, systems science, engineering, computer science, technology, data science, business development, ethics and public policy. This CART team works closely together to leverage existing considerable infrastructure, with members from ORCATECH at Oregon Health & Science University, Intel, VA (VISN20), Rush University, Oregon State University, University of Pennsylvania and CREATE (Center for Research and Education on Aging and Technology Enhancement) at University of Miami. As a result, our CART will work rapidly, building on an already-existing system demonstrated as adaptable and sustainable for over a decade. In years 1-3 we will apply a systems development life cycle approach with iterative user- centered design and technology and infrastructure creation. To ensure sustained use and ecological validity of the data, the design is as unobtrusive as possible for research participants, as well as technology agnostic. In year 4 the developed system will be assessed in a Demonstration Project with an original AiP hypothesis fundamental to CART research: whether the system created provides evidence for sustained independence. We introduce innovative AiP methods including: a unique Personal Health and Activity Record, combining functionality of a personal health record with ecological momentary assessment capacity; novel use of Bluetooth beacon technology to assess activity of couples and caregivers; assessment of community travel (e.g., driving); and an assessment tool to predict sustainable engagement in future CART research. We rigorously test the AiP hypothesis and these innovations in 360 participants from four diverse senior populations: residents in low income, section 202 housing; veterans in the rural Pacific Northwest; African Americans and other minorities in Chicago (Minority Aging Research Study) and Miami (PRISM study). The secure extensible data system for CART's multidimensional and hierarchical data will accommodate multiple, evolving data ontologies and schema. CART's Data Repository and communications plan will facilitate data and resource sharing of multiple users of different levels of sophistication ensuring the widest impact and dissemination. Several sustainability models will be evaluated to ensure the success of a larger CART phase II effort, resulting in the high-impact research enterprise needed to create evidence for effective assessments and interventions to sustain health and independence for the growing aging population."
"9034852","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately one in three older adults fall annually and it is the primary cause of traumatic injury in older adults. Prevention of falls in older adult is a significant public health priority, as one of the Healthy People 2020 goals is to reduce the rate  of emergency department visits due to falls by 10%. While exercise and balance programs have been shown to be effective in reducing fall risk, maintaining behavior change is known to be difficult. Thus additional interventions need to be validated to add to our current armamentarium to reduce falls in older adults. Cognitive training (CT) involves exercises that target specific cognitive tasks, such as memory or processing speed. It has been speculated that routinely performing such tasks may increase functional ability. Recent work has pointed to an increased risk of falls in community-dwelling older adults who have alterations in specific cognitive tasks. Thus the purpose of the proposed study is to demonstrate the feasibility and to explore the effectiveness of a CT intervention to reduce risk and incidence of fall and improve outcomes up to 1 month post-intervention in a group of non-demented community dwelling older adults at risk for fall."
"9207386","Project Summary/Abstract  The Management Core is responsible for leadership and networking; communication and problem resolution; administration; and, implementation of the Recruitment, Engagement, and Retention Center that will identify, recruit and retain all samples for the proposed studies in this U19 application. Two community-based research teams in Los Angeles and New Orleans will screen all intakes at five homeless shelters and gay- identified community based-organizations for 18 months, testing 4500 gay, bisexual and transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), and serious drug use, and obtaining self-reports of mental health, health care utilization, and comorbid conditions. From this initial screening, the 1500 youth at highest risk of acquiring HIV and 220 youth living with HIV will be identified and repeatedly assessed at four month intervals over 24 months. Over this time, 36-90 acutely HIV infected youth will be identified and triaged into potent ARV treatment and a multi-component text, social media, and coaching intervention (Study 1). Interventions with seronegative GBTY and HY and youth living with HIV will also be conducted, with each intervention including both Automated Messaging and Monitoring Interventions and either an eNavigator or Coach. The Management Core will ensure quality assurance and monitor automated indices of performance so that the quality of all activities is to the highest scientific standards and consistent with the values and best interests of the communities and youth participating in the U19 studies.  The Management Core will be led by an experienced group of researchers with long histories of productive and cutting-edge findings in adolescent HIV interventions for both seronegative and seropositive youth; experience in the management of large centers, similar to program projects; expertise in acute infections among infants, adolescent medicine, community-based participatory research, STI, and rapid diagnostic tests; and, experience conducting laboratory research across broad distances and executing complex integrated studies on collaborative teams."
"9264137","PROJECT SUMMARY The research program to be continued through this competitive renewal focuses on abnormalities in nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) function as a factor in ethanol (EtOH) addiction, and the treatment target potential of this system for EtOH abuse. Studies during the previous funding period investigated the functional status of the N/OFQ system in Marchigian Sardinian Alcohol Preferring (msP) and stock Wistar rats, as well as N/OFQ system activation as a means to reduce EtOH-related addictive behavior. Nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP) agonists reliably reduced voluntary EtOH drinking. However, in msP rats that carry an innate upregulation of the N/OFQ system, these effects required chronic administration. At the same time, rats with NOP receptor deletion (NOP-KO rats) consumed significantly less EtOH than wild-type controls. Thus, the ?therapeutic? actions of NOP agonists seem to depend on their eventual downregulation of the N/OFQ system. Consequently, acute suppression of N/OFQ transmission by NOP antagonists would be expected to produce the same inhibitory effects on EtOH-motivated behavior as chronic agonist-induced downregulation of this system. Preliminary data that acute NOP receptor blockade reduces EtOH intake in msP rats tentatively confirmed this hypothesis. Capitalizing on these findings, this project is designed to investigate the ?therapeutic? potential of NOP antagonists and the association between N/OFQ function and EtOH-motivated addictive behavior. SPECIFIC AIM 1 will establish the effects of acute NOP receptor blockade on EtOH consumption, motivation to obtain EtOH under increasing workloads, and EtOH craving measured by contextual reinstatement of EtOH seeking. This Aim will also establish whether rats with innate (msP rats) or EtOH-induced (postdependent Wistar rats) N/OFQ system upregulation, are more sensitive to the effects of NOP blockade than rats with normal N/OFQ function (nondependent Wistar rats). SPECIFIC AIM 2 will establish the effects of chronic NOP antagonist treatment -- likely to be employed in treatment settings -- on EtOH- motivated behaviors to generate translationally relevant information. In parallel, this Aim will establish whether chronic NOP antagonist exposure produces adaptive changes in the N/OFQ system that may have implictions for the therapeutic potential of NOP receptor blockade. SPECIFIC AIM 3 will investigate how N/OFQ system upregulation enhances vulnerability to EtOH drinking and seeking. This Aim will also to identify the brain areas in which dysregulation of the N/OFQ system is responsible for enhanced vulnerability to these behaviors, and thereby shed light on critical sites for the inhibitory actions of NOP blockade on EtOH-motivated behavior. Overall, the research plan is designed to advance current understanding of the treatment target potential of the N/OFQ system for alcohol use disorder and the role of this system in predisposition vulnerability to develop EtOH dependence. NOP antagonists are in Phase 2 clinical trials such that the proposed work may have significant relevance for future development of these compounds towards treatments for alcohol use disorder."
"9353488","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maintenance of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is critical for health. Proteostasis is perturbed in several aging-related diseases including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Caring for patients with these diseases is consuming an increasing fraction of our health care budget. Strikingly, care for Alzheimer's patients alone is responsible for $226 billion in spending per year, and no treatments are available. Thus, new approaches are needed. One such approach involves leveraging the host/pathogen response to infection with intracellular microbes. Our long-term goal is to dissect the mechanisms by which host cells upregulate proteostasis pathways to cope with the increased burden of intracellular infection and replication. Closing this gap in our understanding will provide new insights about proteostasis, and could provide novel treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Our central hypothesis is that hosts can sense the effects of intracellular infection and increase proteostasis capacity to cope with this increased burden. The objective here is to determine the mechanisms by which the nematode C. elegans upregulates ubiquitin ligase components in response to infection by a natural intracellular microbe that belongs to the microsporidia phylum. Microsporidia commonly infect all animals including humans, and can replicate to very high levels without causing overt effects on the host, likely due to host compensatory mechanisms.  Our recent findings indicate that C. elegans upregulates ubiquitin ligase components in response to diverse intracellular infections including microsporidia and virus (Bakowski et al 2014). In unpublished data we have isolated mutants defective in an F-box-related gene (fbxr-1) that constitutively express these ubiquitin ligase components. fbxr-1 mutants have increased pathogen resistance, as well as greatly enhanced thermotolerance and reduced levels of aggregated proteins, indicating improved proteostasis capacity.  We hypothesize that C. elegans increases transcription of Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase components in order to target misfolded proteins for ubiquitination and destruction, increasing tolerance of proteotoxic insults. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine where the Cullin, as well as its upstream negative regulator FBXR-1 act to regulate thermotolerance. We also will perform structure/function analysis on the Cullin to test the hypothesis that it is part of a multi-subunit SCF ubiquitin ligase component. In Specific Aim 2 we will identify these other SCF ligase components using genetic and biochemical approaches. In Specific Aim 3 we will identify new components of the FBXR-1/Cullin pathway using RNAseq analysis, genetic epistasis, and a forward genetic screen. In Specific Aim 4 we will determine where and when FBXR-1 regulates levels of protein aggregates. This approach is innovative because it leverages the host response to obligate intracellular infection to understand how proteostasis can be improved. The proposed research is significant because it could lead to new treatments for diseases of compromised proteostasis, such as Alzheimer's disease."
"9354376","Frailty is increasingly recognized as a leading indicator of poor health outcomes, even death, as well as a barometer of how well patients respond to treatment. To truly provide patient-centered care, providers should be aware of each patient's frailty status and incorporate it into clinical decision making. Providers can now offer a number of invasive and aggressive procedures for cardiovascular disease, which involve risk, and can be painful. The treatment intensity need to match the expected patient outcome, yet providers do not have a reliable method to estimate prognosis for frail patients. In the study proposed here, we will use a novel approach that leverages the electronic health record (EHR) in identifying patient frailty status, with the goal of supporting retrospective clinical studies and prospective clinical decision making. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated the availability of frailty-related findings in EHR, the feasibility of extracting frailty findings, and the feasibility of using EHR-extracted frailty for outcome prediction. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Create a frailty ontology building on existing functional status and quality of life measurements; 2) Develop ontology guided, natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting frailty descriptions and measurements; 3) Develop a model to aggregate NLP-extracted frailty findings to generate a patient-level frailty score; 4) Examine the all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital readmission one year after major cardiac procedures in heart failure patients with different frailty scores and assess the impact of this information on surgical decision making."
"9185765","This study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate a novel treatment for patients with painful knee osteoarthritis. The study will recruit patients who have osteoarthritis isolated to the medial compartment of the knee. Half of the patients will participate in a gait retraining program to alter their foot placement during walking; the other half will be assigned to a self-directed walking group. Gait retraining will be subject-specific and will depend on a key feature of each subject's baseline gait, namely which peak (early or late) in the bi-modal knee adduction moment (KAM) profile is larger. The retraining will involve changing the foot progression angle, which is the angle the foot makes relative to the forward direction. The intervention will involve either increasing internal foot rotation (toe-in) or increasing external foot rotation (toe-out). Previously, toe-in has been shown to reduce only the first peak, whereas toe-out has been shown to reduce only the second peak. Because of the personalized intervention, we expect all retrained subjects will be able to reduce the (larger) peak KAM and to reduce knee pain. Based on previous studies, we expect that approximately 80% of subjects in the gait retraining group will need to increase toe-in, and 20% of subjects will need to increase toe-out.  Gait retraining will be done using a vibration feedback device taped to the lower leg as each subject walks on a treadmill. Body segment kinematics will be captured and ground reaction forces will be measured. During each step, subjects will receive vibration feedback informing them how they should change their foot progression angle during the next step. Real-time feedback facilitates training since an individual knows immediately whether their foot placement was correct or not, and they are informed via the feedback signal whether or not to change their foot angle during the next step. The gait retraining consists of once a week sessions for six weeks. The training uses a fading feedback approach, where the percentage of each weekly session during which feedback is used is decreased from week to week until no feedback is used by the last training session. At that point the new gait pattern is internalized and that new pattern then represents the new ?natural? gait pattern for each individual. Throughout the six-week training period subjects will be encouraged to practice their new gait for at least ten minutes per day. After the six-week training, subjects will continue to use their new gait. Subjects will undergo gait lab checks at weeks 21, 31 and 41 and monitoring of foot progression angle under free-living conditions using ?smart? shoes during weeks 8, 31 and 52 to assess retention, with refresher training if necessary. Their last assessment will be at 52 weeks.  Participants in the control group will receive an educational pamphlet developed by the Arthritis Foundation that describes the benefits of regular walking for those with arthritis. A self-directed walking program has be shown to provide pain relief for those with knee osteoarthritis, although we expect the patients who undergo gait retraining will have an additional benefit from a reduction in excessive forces on the medial compartment of the knee, thereby slowing disease progression.  All subjects will receive a monthly phone call to encourage maintaining a regular walking regimen for 52 weeks. The gait retraining group also will be reminded to focus on practicing their new gait pattern. For both groups, walking activity will be monitored for one week using an accelerometer- based pedometer during weeks 7, 31 and 52. All subjects will receive a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan and weight-bearing knee radiographs at weeks 0 and 52 to assess knee cartilage composition and organization, and joint space, respectively. All participants will also complete clinical knee score questionnaires and visual analog pain scales at weeks 0, 7, 11, 31 and 52."
"9296808","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus for this proposal is on prevention research in Botswana to reduce incidence of HIV/AIDS. This is central to the current research activities of the faculty mentors, who collaborate extensively with each other and with key partners at the Botswana site. Our partner for training is the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP), a limited liability nonprofit corporation (LLC) with the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Botswana. The BHP is the largest HIV/AIDS research organization in Botswana, and one of the largest in Africa. The long- term goals and objectives of this training program are to train research leaders who can take responsibility for the BHP within the next 5-10 years, and to staff the MOH with local AIDS experts. Botswana currently has the second-highest prevalence of HIV in the world for adults (25%), but has also had the highest rate of antiretroviral drug treatment (ART) for patients with AIDS (about 90%, according to WHO). The government of Botswana, the training faculty at Harvard, and the key collaborators at BHP have now decided to focus their efforts on prevention research. A new research grant based on a combination of prevention interventions includes participation by 10 of the 14 Harvard training faculty. AIDS-related courses, seminars, and workshops are available for trainees. We have requested funds for 2 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral positions each year. We estimate that we will train about 18 trainees over 5 years, allowing for multiple years for each PhD candidate and some postdoctoral fellows, and assuming several short-term trainees could fill a single annual training slot. Stipends will be based on current degrees and research experience; thus an MD on an MS or PhD program would be eligible for a postdoctoral-level stipend. All trainees would have at least a BSc degree. We estimate that about half will be physicians with clinical experience. Some will be postdoctoral fellows who have PhD's in a related area but no experience in AIDS research. Each trainee will have a principal advisor and a faculty advisory committee. Selection of trainees is based on previous academic performance, references, experience, and assurance that the candidates will return to participate in AIDS research in Botswana. The quality of the program will be monitored by a Training Advisory Committee composed of experts from the US and from developing countries. The success of the training program will be judged by the relative increase in senior research positions at BHP and MOH that are individuals who were trained by this program after the second and fourth years. Success will also be judged by the implementation of successful prevention research programs that involve trainees, numbers of trainee publications in high-impact journals, and number of staff positions filled by former trainees at the BHP and the Ministry of Health."
"9146350","?    DESCRIPTION: Conditionally silencing the activity of specific neural ensembles is a powerful approach for mapping the circuits responsible for specific behaviors. While microbial opsin tools currently exist to silence neural activity with light, these tools have significant limitations tha make them unsuitable for applications that require persistent silencing over the course of minutes or hours. Longer term neuronal silencing has been classically achieved by expressing the catalytic light chain of Clostridium neurotoxins, which disrupt neurotransmitter release, however this approach suffers from poor temporal and spatial control. Recent chemogenetic approaches, including designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) have been developed for persistent silencing, but lack the spatiotemporal benefits of optogenetic approaches. Thus, there remains an unmet need for silencing tools that combine the robust and persistent silencing qualities of Clostridium neurotoxin and chemogenetic approaches, with the spatiotemporal control of optogenetics. Here we will develop a completely new toolkit for rapid, extended neural silencing with a single, brief light pulse that can be readiy activated by either single or multiphoton excitation for in vivo systems. Our tools will not only b applicable to neurotransmitter systems, but also to neuromodulatory systems and glial transmission. These powerful tools will complement and extend the existing opto- and chemogenetic silencing toolset by allowing rapid, robust and persistent silencing with a single light pulse. Because our strategy operates on a completely different principle than current tools, it could be multiplexed with existing approaches for complex remote control of circuit activity during behavior."
"9106525","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the Drosophila eye, inner photoreceptors (PRs) R7 and R8 mediate color vision and belong to two subtypes, expressing UV-sensitive Rh3 in R7 and Blue-Rh5 in R8 (p subtype), or UV-Rh4 in R7 and Green-Rh6 in R8 (y subtype). Reminiscent of the stochastic distribution of L and M cones in the human retina, the two subtypes are distributed stochastically, with a p:y ratio of 35:65. We have deciphered the gene regulatory network that controls PR subtype specification. The random choice between p and y fate is controlled by stochastic expression of the transcription factor Spineless in 65% of R7s where it induces yR7/Rh4 fate. We have shown that each spineless allele makes an intrinsic stochastic choice to be expressed; however, inter-chromosomal communication synchronizes expression of the two alleles. We will address whether the mechanisms of stochastic choices can be generalized, and why Drosophila uses a stochastic distribution while other species exhibit highly deterministic PR patterning. We will use transcriptomics and cis- regulatory dissection to continue our investigations of PR subtype specification. Finally, we will investigate  how PRs that are stochastically determined find their corresponding targets in the optic lobes to convey color information to the brain. Aim 1. Stochastic vs. deterministic choices in photoreceptor determination. Using the MS2 system, manipulation of the spineless proximal promoter and its epigenetic landscape, we will live image spineless transcription in PRs to understand whether spineless is initially stochastically repressed, or if noisy fluctuations are locked-in at a given time. We will analyze the role of spineless in other species, e.g. in butterflies that have two R7s that make independent stochastic choices, and use CRISPR to knock out spineless in these species. Another fly family, Dolichopodidae (Doli), has eyes with alternate stripes of Green and Blue R8s. We will address the regulation and function of spineless in this deterministic process. We will swap the Doli spineless gene into D. melanogaster to make it deterministic. Finally, we will analyze how the neural network is reconfigured in the visual system of males of many fly species to build an improved motion detector. Aim 2. Cis- and trans-regulatory logic of photoreceptor subtype specification. We have obtained a comprehensive knowledge of the gene regulatory network controlling PR determination and the cis-regulation of Rh promoters. However, PR specification precedes Rh expression by two days. We will therefore analyze how early genes (dpr11, dve, warts and melted) are expressed in subtypes of PRs and compare the logic of regulation at several stages for these different genes with functions in PR specification or axon pathfinding. We will compare the early and late transcriptomes of the four types of color as well as polarization PRs and identify potential regulators predicted by our cis-analysis of Rh promoters. Aim 3. How do stochastically determined PRs find their target in the optic lobes? We will investigate whether and how p and y R7 and R8 connect to dedicated subsets of neurons in the medulla and address how these neurons are specified to transmit color information. We will study the role of Ig proteins Dprs and their DIP receptors that allow the matching of PRs and their target in the medulla. Finally, we will study how stochastically determined PRs specify their target neurons or allow survival of pre-existing medulla neurons."
"9241751","PROJECT SUMMARY Healthy sleep is important to behavioral, neurobiological, and physiologic health. Emerging literature suggests that stress biomarkers, such as cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and body mass index (BMI) increase when healthy sleep habits are not regularly practiced among older children and adults. These biomarkers are associated with stress and increased risk for future disease. Researchers suggest that young children from racial/ethnic minority groups and/or living with socioeconomic adversity are especially vulnerable to poor sleep beginning within the first year of life. However, little is known about the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress, and health among very young children living with adversity. The proposed study will address this important scientific gap. This study will improve our understanding of these relationships during a critical developmental period in children's lives ? toddlerhood. Using a longitudinal design with repeated measures to prospectively examine the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress, and toddler's health from age 12 months to 24 months, we will address the following aims: 1. Examine changes in subjective and objective sleep characteristics from 12 to 24 months of age; 2. Examine changes in stress biomarkers from 12 to 24 months of age; 3. Examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep characteristics and stress response; 4. Examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep characteristics and toddlers' behavioral health. The sample will include 113 toddlers who live in socioeconomically disadvantaged homes. Data will be collected during at two time points (age 12 months and 24 months). Data on sleep characteristics will include subjective and objective measures of sleep duration and efficiency, obtained with questionnaires, diaries, and 9 days/nights of sleep actigraphy. Multi-systemic biomarkers of stress including cortisol, C-reactive protein, S-IgA, and BMI, will be measured individually and then explored as a latent variable of stress. Caregiver-reported behavioral health problems will be measured as it is closely associated with children's present and future health. Indicators of economic, environmental, and psychological adversity will be obtained and their relationships with primary variables will be explored. Generalized linear models will be used in the data analysis. Data from this study will be used to support future R-series grant applications designed to further understand the relationships among sleep, stress, and health by following these children over time with additional measures of stress and health to identify causal pathways and ultimately test the effects of interventions, such as those that may improve sleep, among young children at risk for toxic stress. While my past clinical and research experience focused on interventions to support parent- child relationships among families living with adversity, the next step in my career development is to acquire training to understand behavioral and biological aspects of sleep and stress and to explore the extent to which healthy sleep buffers toddlers' stress response to chronic stress early in life."
"9242454","Objectives: Difficulty retrieving the right word to communicate a message is the most common complaint in healthy older adults and individuals with stroke-induced language impairment (i.e., aphasia). Novel word learning paradigms have been used to investigate a variety of behavioral and neuromodulatory approaches to improve word retrieval deficits. Previous novel word learning studies have shown that physical exercise can improve long term recall in healthy young adults and that increased levels of dopamine may be responsible for this effect; however, no studies have investigated the effects of exercise on novel word learning in older adults and individuals with aphasia, and very little is known about the mechanisms that support exercise-enhanced word learning in these populations. The aims of this SPiRE are to: 1) to identify the novel word learning paradigm that facilitates immediate and long-term word recall; 2a) to investigate how acute, moderate-intensity exercise alters levels of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and plasma dopamine; and 2b) to describe and quantify the association between novel word learning and any observed changes in serum BDNF and plasma dopamine. This research will provide a platform for future investigations of immediate exercise effects on word learning, which are essential for achieving our long-term goal of developing exercise-based word retrieval interventions for healthy older veterans and veterans with aphasia. Methods: A within subjects crossover design will be used to address Aims 1, 2a and 2b. Subjects will complete aerobic exercise or stretching (training) before engaging in Study Only or Retrieval Practice (learning). Subjects will be counterbalanced within and across conditions. Twelve healthy older veterans and 12 veterans with aphasia, age 65-89 years, will be recruited. The study will comprise 18 sessions over 12 weeks. In Week 1, subjects will undergo baseline blood draws, a physical assessment, cognitive and language assessments, and a practice word learning task. In Weeks 2-12, subjects will complete the four conditions. Each condition will last two weeks, with a one-week break between conditions. In each condition, training and learning sessions will take place on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Training: Subjects will engage in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity cycling or gentle upper and lower limb stretching (control) prior to engaging in a novel word learning task. Learning: Familiar objects (e.g., cup) will be paired with nonwords (e.g., flark). In the Study Only paradigm, object/nonword pairs will be presented three times across three days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). In the Retrieval Practice paradigm, object/nonword pairs will be presented during the first session (Monday). In subsequent sessions (Wednesday, Friday), subjects will be asked to recall the nonword name of presented objects. Corrective feedback will be provided on each trial. Testing: Recognition and recall testing without corrective feedback will be administered immediately after learning (short-term memory), before training in the second and third learning session (overnight consolidation) and one week after learning (long-term memory). Blood Draws: Three blood samples will be taken at baseline (rest, 30 minutes, 60 minutes). In each of the four conditions, blood samples will be taking during the first and third learning session (at rest, after training, and after learning). Whole blood will be collected in plain tubes and in anticoagulant-treated tubes for subsequent serum BDNF and plasma dopamine analysis by ELISA. Samples will be analyzed in triplicate to increase reliability. To address Aim 1, we will use a mixed effects model approach to fit repeated measures ANOVAs to word recall scores at after learning (immediate recall) and one week later (long-term recall). To address Aim 2a, we will use a mixed effects model approach to fit repeated measures ANOVA to serum BDNF and plasma dopamine levels obtained at rest, after 30 minutes and 60 minutes at baseline and during training sessions on Monday and Friday. To address Aim2b, we will use a mixed effects model approach to fit ANCOVA mediator analyses to investigate the association between neurophysiological changes (BDNF, dopamine) on word recall (immediate, long-term)."
"9233692","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease that affects 1.25 million individuals in the United States and is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. T1D GWAS studies have identified 114 index SNPs mapping to 58 loci that influence disease risk, but how these loci contribute to T1D pathogenesis is largely unknown. A major challenge in functionally characterizing T1D loci is identifying the precise causal variant(s) underlying disease risk at each locus. As the majority of T1D-risk variants are non-coding, an additional challenge is inferring the target genes of T1D-risk signals. Finally, functional validation of causal T1D-risk variants requires the use of appropriate experimental models for the key pathogenic cell types. To address these challenges we have assembled a team of highly accomplished investigators in human genome sciences (Gaulton and Frazer), epigenomics and high-throughput molecular assays (Ren), as well as T1D biology and diabetes models of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) (Sander). We propose to combine state-of-the-field computational methods, high-throughput molecular assays, and hPSC-based cell models to comprehensively identify T1D causal variants, annotate these variants across T1D- relevant cell types, and define their regulatory functions and target genes. In Aim 1 we will utilize T1D GWAS data, epigenomic annotation and high-throughput transcription factor binding assays to fine-map known T1D loci and identify and fine-map novel loci. These studies will annotate variants across cell types and thus be a broadly informative resource for the T1D community for hypothesis generation of variant function. In preliminary studies we discovered that ~50% of independent T1D-risk signals map to regulatory elements active in islets or pancreatic progenitors, suggesting a possible role of these variants in beta cell and progenitor function. In Aim 2 we will utilize a collection of 100 whole-genome-sequenced hPSCs, including 24 hPSC lines from T1D patients, to derive pancreatic progenitors and then generate Hi-C chromatin conformation, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and DNA methylation profiles. We will utilize these data combined with similar available datasets from human islets to annotate molecular QTLs at T1D-risk variants, as well as to evaluate potential contributions of rare variants to disease etiology in the 24 T1D patients. These analyses will provide insight into how T1D-risk variants alter local (<10kb) chromatin states and gene regulation in islets and their progenitors. In Aim 3 we will further uncover variant/target gene relationships by integrating the genetic data from Aim 1 and the local QTL data from Aim 2 with 3D chromatin contact maps to identify T1D-risk variants in enhancers that are distal (>10kb) QTLs for promoter sites. To validate predicted T1D enhancer-target gene(s) interactions and potentially discover new target genes, we will prioritize ten enhancers with strong molecular phenotypes for functional analysis by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion in hPSCs. The proposed studies will provide key insight into the molecular and cellular functions of T1D-risk variants identified through GWAS."
"9338998","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):      The project aims to build the capacity of the Ministry of Health in Haiti to conduct, interpret, disseminate, and respond to assessments, surveys and other evaluations through the implementation of four specific research projects:        The first study will focus on the seroprevalence of various specific pediatric infections in Haiti and will be carried out by enrolling 1200 children ages 5-10 and collecting Serum and DBS (dry blood spot) samples to be tested at the National Public Health Laboratory (LNSP) with a focus on vaccine preventable diseases including hepatitis B (ELISA) and IFA for rubella and measles. Analysis will focus on descriptive measures of disease prevalence and patient characteristics associated with various infections.        The second study will focus on evaluation of the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by    enrolling approximately 500 children evenly distributed from 0 to 5 years of age and collecting    nasopharyngeal specimens to be tested via isolation and conventional serotyping methods at the National Public Health Reference lab in Port-au-Prince.        The third study will assess the determinants of HIV mortality through two rounds, retrospective    and prospective.

The fourth study will focus on early treatment of PLHIV compared to the standard of care (after CD4 determination. Patients in the test and treat arm will receive treatment within a week of diagnosis concurrent with the pretreatment preparation counseling. The standard of care arm will receive treatment as per current practice (when CD4 <350 and after, pretreatment counseling). All participants will be tested periodically for VL and drug resistance when suppression is not reached (VL > 1000). The primary outcome of the study will be viral load (VL) suppression at 12 months after initiation of therapy.        Outcomes will be measured for a period of 5 years."
"9190656","PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. MI involves cardiomyocyte death, inflammation, and remodeling of the left ventricle, which results in the formation of scar tissue and long-term loss of heart function. One therapeutic strategy is to selectively replace lost cardiomyocytes; however, there are significant challenges to identifying a cell source and engrafting viable cardiomyocytes in the injured myocardium. An alternative is to induce the proliferation of remaining cardiomyocytes towards the regeneration of functional myocardium. Our collaborators in the Morrisey group recently showed that daily, systemic injections of miR302 mimics leads to cardiomyocyte proliferation and promotes cardiac function post-MI through down-regulation of Hippo signaling in a mouse model. However, the therapy was met with several translational impediments, including off-target accumulation, a limited therapeutic time frame for effective treatment, and the inefficiency and costs associated with systemic delivery of miR302 mimics. The goal of this proposal is to develop an injectable hydrogel system to overcome these limitations by locally delivering miR302 to cardiac tissue after MI. Towards this, the first aim of this proposal is to develop guest-host assembled hydrogels based on cationic polyethyleneimine and neutral polyethylene glycol capable of (i) injection (flow through syringe or catheter), (ii) self-healing (for local deposition and retention at the injection site), and (iii) the encapsulation and release of active miR302 over tunable therapeutic windows. The second aim of this proposal is to apply this technology in a small animal model of MI to promote healing and improved global cardiac function. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a platform to deliver various forms of RNAi to cardiac tissue post-MI using a catheter-deliverable hydrogel engineered as an effective drug delivery system. In addition to the research proposal, this fellowship includes a training plan through which I will gain clinical experience, expand my scientific background through collaboration with the Atluri and Morrisey groups, and present my research findings both on and off campus."

"9319419","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the distal airways characterized by recurring symptoms, airway inflammation, and reversible airflow constriction. It is considered a collection of various phenotypes (characteristics) instead  of a single disease. Currently, there is no comprehensive phenotyping specific to older adults with asthma that considers multiple factors relevant to this population. Divergent asthma phenotypes and exposure to unique environmental triggers may affect asthma control in the elderly. In addition, factors contributing to asthma quality of life in the elderly have not been wll explored. The aims of our study are to: (1) develop and systematically implement a phenotyping algorithm in older adults with asthma; (2) longitudinally investigate the effects of asthma phenotypes and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exposures on asthma control in older adults with asthma; and (3) develop a predictive model for asthma quality of life for older adults with asthma. Sub-aims are to explore the impact on moving from community-based to congregate living settings (e. g, assisted living) on the course of asthma in older adults and to identify barriers to successful asthma medication management. One hundred ninety participants 60 years of age or older will be enrolled. Inclusion criteria are: meet standard diagnostic criteri for asthma, non-smokers, have no other chronic respiratory diseases, do not reside in a skilled nursing facility, and have not recently had a major a medical illness. At baseline, participants wil complete spirometry bronchodilator responsiveness, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, methacholine challenge (if not completed within past 5 years), allergic sensitization, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), and sputum analysis, as well as standardized questionnaires to assess asthma control, quality of life, knowledge, and self-efficacy. Within 30 days, an in-home environmental assessment will be conducted to obtain data on VOCs, air particulates, moisture, temperature, humidity, pests, and an asthma home environment checklist. At 9 and 18 months, in-home data will be collected on participants' pulmonary status, asthma control, and asthma quality of life. At 9-months, participants will also complete the measures of medication management. At 18-months, we will conduct follow-up in-home environmental assessments collecting the same data we collected at baseline. Participants who have moved to congregate living facilities will be asked open-ended questions about their perception of the effects of the move on the course of their asthma. Using factor analysis, we will perform a comprehensive phenotypic characterization that will include a wide range of demographics, asthma-specific knowledge and self-efficacy, and biomarkers. Predictive models for asthma control and asthma quality of life will be identified using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling. The findings of  this study will be used in future research to develop and test the efficacy of patient-centered interventions for older adults with asthma to improve asthma control and enhance quality of life."
"9239014","Project summary Auditory supporting cells (SCs) are essential for the proper development, survival and function of mechano- sensory hair cells (HCs) and their innervating neurons. Defects in the biophysical properties or function of SCs result in auditory dysfunction and hearing loss. Despite their importance the molecular mechanisms that control their development and function are largely unknown. A main objective of our proposed study is to uncover the molecular mechanisms that guide auditory SCs development and function. We recently uncovered that Notch signaling instructs SC development in the murine cochlea. Here in this proposed study we will determine the Notch ligand(s) and receptor(s) that control SC differentiation and survival (aim1) as well characterize potential novel roles for Notch signaling and its targets in SC-guided cochlear innervation and auditory function (aim2). Our proposed studies will advance our understanding of how Notch signaling operates in differentiating SCs as wells as provide new insights into how SCs guide neuronal innervation as well as control cochlear homeostasis. A second major objective of our proposed study is to uncover the molecular mechanisms that control the developmental decline of SCs plasticity in the mammalian cochlea. HC loss in mammals is permanent and is a leading cause for deafness in humans. In non- mammalian vertebrates SCs regenerate lost HCs throughout the lifetime of the animal. In mammals, young immature SCs can be coaxed into regenerating lost HCs by inhibiting Notch signaling or over-stimulation of wnt signaling; however, the ability of murine auditory SC to respond to such regenerative stimuli rapidly declines after the first postnatal week. We recently uncovered that the RNA binding protein LIN28B enhances HC production in the immature cochlea in response to Notch signaling. In aim3 we will investigate how LIN28B/let- 7 axis modifies the regenerative response of the immature SCs, as well as address whether LIN28B re- expression in mature SCs enhances their ability to respond to Notch inhibition and regenerate lost HCs. Findings from the proposed experiments could identify new therapeutic targets and lead to novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of HC loss and eventual cure of deafness."
"8998774","The function of the Bioinformatics and Data Management Core is to provide the informatics  infrastructure, analysis tools and specialized expertise required to support the complex data analysis,  integration and storage needs of this Projects and Cores of this grant. Led by Dr. Sarah Cooley, Director of the  Masonic Cancer Center Oncology Medical Informatics & Services (OMIS) shared resource, it is composed of  two teams providing bioinformatics (UK Team; Anthony Nolan Research Institute) and clinical research data  management support (MN team: OMIS). The two groups will meet in person annually and have  teleconferences at least every 4 months to ensure the efficient and integrated management of the Core.   The MN team is responsible for the development and maintenance of database applications to collect,  integrate and report research data generated by the projects for subsequent analysis. In addition they will  support and customize the clinical trials management applications to meet the research and regulatory data  requirements for the complex (phase I, IND, multi-center) trials in Project 3. The sharing of research samples  processed and analyzed by Core D will be coordinated through this Core with a customized sample inventory  management tool. Lastly, this team will ensure data quality, data integrity, and data sharing, in compliance  with HIPAA regulation and NIH principles.   The UK Team will provide bioinformatics support by developing the IPD-KIR Database which will  facilitate the work of both the global research community and the grant members. They will continue to collect  and curate the KIR sequence data and provide regular updates of this data to allow further development of the  typing and sequencing strategies for KIR determination. These developments will include custom  bioinformatics tools and applications specifically designed to aid research by other grant members. An  expanded suite of bespoke analysis tools will be imbedded to allow advanced analysis for non-  Bioinformaticians. A key aim of the IPD project is to provide high quality data that can easily be retrieved and  used by non-Bioinformaticians. This can be seen in the work of the IMGT/HLA Database where high level data  files, XML, are available for Bioinformaticians, but also tools with easy to use interfaces are provided to allow  data analysis possible for a wider range of researchers. They will fully characterize novel KIR sequences  detected in Project 1 (SA3) and ensure these data are represented in the public database this will be achieved  by conventional cloning methodologies and employing third generation sequencing strategies on the Pacific  Biosciences RS II platform. The scientific expertise provided by this team will be invaluable to analyze and  interpret immunogenetic data."
"9234823","ABSTRACT  In the patient-family caregiver dyad, emphasis traditionally has been on the patient or on helping the caregiver take care of the patient. This approach ignores the health of the caregiver. Family caregivers of patients with chronic disease are at uniquely high risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of the environment they share with the patient, lack of time for personal care due to caregiving demands, and persistent psychological distress, caregivers of patients with chronic illness have substantially higher risk for CVD than non-caregivers. To reduce this risk, cardiovascular health interventions aimed at (1) CVD risk reduction (2) improving adherence to self-management of CVD risk reducing behaviors, and (3) preventing and managing depressive symptoms are required. Rural caregivers are particularly at risk for poor health. Most rural areas are characterized by marked health disparities, including elevated CVD risk, persistent poverty, and lack of social and healthcare resources. As such, innovative intervention programs are needed to improve cardiovascular health among rural caregivers while overcoming personal and environmental barriers to achieving this goal.  The Rural Intervention for Caregivers? Heart Health (RICHH) program proposed in this study will address the important components of CVD risk reduction for rural caregivers of patients with chronic illness ? most notably improved self-management of CVD risk reduction efforts, including prevention and management of depressive symptoms. We propose an innovative delivery modality designed to overcome environmental barriers in socioeconomically austere rural areas. The purpose of the proposed 2-group (RICHH vs control) randomized clinical trial is to examine short- and long-term effects of the RICHH intervention on CVD risk (i.e., lipid profile, body mass index, and blood pressure), self-care behaviors (i.e., diet quality, physical activity level, self-reported adherence to health behaviors), and depressive symptoms, compared to usual care control in rural caregivers of persons with chronic disease. A total of 280 caregivers of patients with chronic illness will be enrolled. Rural caregivers will be randomly assigned to either the RICHH intervention group or a usual care control group. We will stratify caregivers by gender in order to examine the moderating effect of gender on intervention outcomes, given the many differences between male and female caregivers. The RICHH intervention (6 interactive modules) will be delivered for 12 weekly sessions (30- to 45 minutes per session). In order to enhance maintenance of behaviors, we will also deliver 8 biweekly (every other week) booster sessions (20-30 minutes per sessions) for 2 months and then 6 monthly sessions. All sessions are delivered individually using a video-conferencing program on a multimedia digital device (i.e., mini iPad). Data on outcomes will be collected at baseline, 4 months and 12 months."
"9253281","SMALL MOLECULE THERAPEUTICS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SUMMARY:  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder that affects approximately one- tenth of the population over the age of 65. There is currently no cure for the disease. The pathological hallmarks of the disease include the formation and accumulation in the brain of ß-amyloid (Aß). Earlier therapeutic attempts at lowering total Aß by directly targeting the catalytic activities of ß- or ?-secretase were unsuccessful as the enzymes hydrolyze other substrates besides APP, many with critical cellular functions. Cenna has a novel technology that does not target the secretases, which has yielded two potential peptide drug candidates P8 and P4 from the amino terminal domain of Presenilin (PS-1), with the ability to inhibit the production of Aß in vitro and in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD. We recently provided evidence (1) that peptides P4 and P8 give a strong, specific and biologically relevant binding with the purified ectodomain of APP 695. We further demonstrated that the reduction of Aß by the peptides does not affect the catalytic activities of ß- or ?-secretase, or the level of APP. These peptides and their derivatives offer new potential drug candidates for the treatment of AD. While P8 is being further developed as a peptide drug, P4 is too unstable. It is important to develop alternate back-up candidates besides P8. It would be advantageous to identify small molecule compounds that bind APP at the same sites as P4 and P8 and by so doing also reduce Aß. We have carried out molecular modeling studies to determine binding sites on the APP ectodomain for both P4 and P8. Having accomplished that, we virtually screened a library of e-compounds to identify those molecules that would be predicted to bind the same sites on APP as P4 and P8. Of the ~160,000 structures screened, a total of 249 suggested binding to APP at either the P4 or P8 binding site. These compound have been scored and grouped. In the current grant application our specific aims are: 1) To experimentally confirm by microarray analysis the binding to the APP ectodomain of the small molecule compounds identified by virtual screening. 2) To test the small molecule compounds that give positive hits for their ability to reduce A? production in vitro and 3) To test in vivo in APP Tg mice, selected compounds identified in vitro to reduce A? by similar amounts as P4 and P8. A successful completion of the project will provide us with small molecule candidates with the ability to reduce Aß in vitro and in vivo by the same mechanism as our peptide candidates. As with the peptides, the small molecule compounds would not be expected to affect the catalytic activities of the secretases. Furthermore, these compounds may be developed as oral drugs that can cross the blood brain barrier."
"9264075","Substantial evidence demonstrates that prenatal events have effects on development resulting in pathophysiological consequences in adulthood. The outcome of some of these effects is a predisposition to certain diseases including hypertension. Our data from the previous funding period demonstrate that prenatal exposure to clinically relevant doses of glucocorticoids at a critical stage of gestation (peak of nephrogenesis) reduces nephron number, impairs excretion of a salt load (that is gender dependent) and elevates blood pressure in adulthood. Although knowledge of the mechanisms whereby sodium excretion is altered is nearly nonexistent, alterations in the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which we have reported may be involved. In addition, it is not known if the alterations in renal development and the intrarenal RAS result in greater susceptibility to renal damage and greater loss of function following a second insult. Therefore this proposed project has two objectives. The first is to determine if the mechanisms responsible for the reduced ability to excrete a sodium load involve alterations in the receptors/signaling pathways that respond to the angiotensin peptides in the kidney. The second is to ascertain if prenatal betamethasone exposure results in higher risk for additional renal damage from an adverse event after birth. We will study sheep, because they are similar to humans in terms of the timing of nephrogenesis relative to stage of gestation and because these animals provide sufficient quantities of renal tissue for our in vitro studies. We hypothesize that: 1) the mechanisms involved in the reduced ability to excrete a sodium load include reductions in the ability of Ang peptides to activate signaling pathways associated with natriuresis; and, 2) prenatal betamethasone exposure results in greater risk for renal damage and reductions in function following a second insult afterbirth. We will use specific assays to measure the angiotensin peptides and key components in the signaling pathways activated by them associated with natriuresis. Binding assays will be used to assess receptors for these peptides. We will use unilateral nephrectomy or obesity (induced by voluntary overeating) as second hits and evaluate renal function and markers of renal damage to establish if there is a predisposing relationship between prenatal betamethasone and subsequent renal injury. Understanding more about the impact of antenatal glucocorticoids on renal function and susceptibility to renal damage in adulthood is important because of the widespread use of glucocorticoids in Obstetrics today. Our studies may identify a population at greater risk for renal disease and hypertension as they mature which could result in approaches for monitoring this at risk population and early intervention to prevent premature deterioration of renal function in adulthood."

"9330333","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Competing Theories and Emerging Complexities Social relations are widely recognized to influence health and to impact health disparities. Despite theoretical advancements and methodological innovations, we still do not know: 1) how social relationships and support change with age or 2) when social relationships are most beneficial or harmful to health. The proposed research addresses these issues by extending the Social Relations, Age and Health Study (SRS) to examine three waves of data over 20 years and by investigating detailed changes in social relations over one year using both monthly assessments and multiple informants. Specifically, we propose to:  1) Analyze 3 wave longitudinal data over 20 years to test competing theories about age, social relations and health. A third wave of the SRS will allow for unique opportunities to specify the direction and shape of change in the structure and quality of social relations over time.  2) Conduct an in-depth study of support exchanges and social contagion with multiple informants in a one year monthly longitudinal web-based study. We will test the relative strength of the three hypothesized mechanisms of social contagion: induction, homophile and shared environment.  3) Examine whether 20 year longitudinal patterns of social relations predict short term changes in enacted support over one year and identify long-term patterns of support type that predict short-term health trajectories. These unique data will permit an unparalleled examination of competing exchange theories, e.g. altruism, developmental stake, support bank, and their association with health innovation. We propose theoretical (test of competing theories) and methodological (20 year longitudinal data, multiple perspective network data, and web based follow-up) innovations to clarify recent complex and contradictory findings concerning health and social relations. Impact Findings will impact scholarship on the link between social relations and health as well as public policy focused programs designed to improve health and decrease health disparities."
"9161167","ABSTRACT Biorepositories are critical to enabling modern molecular-based research that will drive the development of a new generation of targeted diagnostics and therapies as well as personalized medicine to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The use of data and biospecimen resources collected during research are constrained by the informed consent that research participants give to research teams, research protocol documents, and the constraints imposed on the research by the IRB itself. Currently there is a lack of a common model of consent that limits how easily data (and research specimens) from multiple research projects, or multiple institutions can be combined for large-scale retrospective studies. Manually examining and reconciling potentially millions of informed consent forms from different biobanks becomes an expensive and possibly irreconcilable problem. The application of suitable metadata in support of the complex set of regulatory, legal, privacy and security requirement processes and information flows involved in regulated research is a field in an early phases of development. The complicated legal and technical requirements involved in the processes challenge our ability to effectively build information systems that support sharing of research data, specimens and other research artifacts at scale. Additionally, much of the regulatory processes involved in research are still based on paper-based workflows. We posit that by developing suitable machine-based metadata representation of regulatory processes focusing on informed consents and the associated documents would enhance the ability of regulatory bodies such as Institutional Review Boards to 1) review proposals in a more streamlined fashion, 2) have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of risk along multiple axes, and 3) provide a formal and computable basis for data sharing and information release policies. More specifically we will focus on three specific aims: 1) Develop standard-conforming metadata representations of informed consent; 2) Develop NLP-based automatic annotation tool for informed consent documents; and 3) Evaluate the metadata-ontology-based approach for semantically representing the domain and demonstrate its capacity for answering competency questions. Our proposed approach is novel for the following reasons: 1) it provides the first metadata ontology, to the best of our knowledge, to represent the informed consent space while considering the US common rules; 2) it combines natural language processing technologies with ontology-based approaches for semantic annotation as well as ontology enrichment; and 3) it engages stakeholders in the ontology development and evaluation process and uses competency questions to verify the coverage of the ontology."
"9071749","PROJECT SUMMARY ? CANCER BIOLOGY PROGRAM  The Cancer Biology Program is focused on investigating the mechanisms and signaling pathways  involved in malignant transformation. The goals are to advance basic understanding of cancer  pathogenesis and to facilitate the translation of basic science discoveries into the clinical arena through  collaborations to improve the outcome of patients with cancer. Program research centers on three major  scientific themes:  Theme 1: Mechanisms and Pathways of Oncogenesis. Investigations are focused on mechanistic  analyses of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, as well as the control of cell division, genomic  stability and DNA damage checkpoints that underlie and drive cancer pathogenesis.  Theme 2: Epigenetics. Diverse approaches are being employed to investigate the epigenetic factors  and perturbations that are increasingly associated with a wide spectrum of malignancies, with a particular  focus on factors that maintain and read the histone code, as well as the chromatin remodeling machinery  and IncRNAs that have epigenetic relevance.  Theme 3: Epithelial Neoplasia. The molecular and cellular biology of solid tumors, including lung, GI,  skin and GU neoplasias, are being investigated using a variety of in vitro and in vivo model systems.  Major achievements in this funding period include characterization of oncogenic BAF fusion proteins in  synovial sarcomas, derivation of novel techniques for assessing genome-wide chromatin accessibility,  discovery and characterization of epigenetic lncRNAs, validation of novel oncogenes in organoid cultures,  scaffold targeting of the MAPK pathway, and identification of new downstream targets in the Hedgehog  (Hh) signaling pathway.  Co-led by Michael Cleary, MD, and Calvin Kuo, MD, PhD, the 40 program members represent three  schools (the School of Medicine, the School of Humanities & Sciences and the School of Engineering),  14 Departments, and five Divisions within the Department of Medicine. The research activities of the 40  investigators are supported by 80 peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated grants and 3 T32 training awards.  Peer-reviewed funding consists of $28.1M in total costs/year of which $9.5M is from the NCI. Other NIH  support amounts to $16.5M and other peer-reviewed support to $2.1M. Since 2009, program  investigators have published over 280 manuscripts relevant to cancer biology in peer-reviewed journals  of which 15% are intra-programmatic and 48% inter-programmatic, with numerous externally  collaborative manuscripts. The SCI will continue to be invaluable in seeding innovative projects and in  assisting with the translation of the basic science findings from this program into new approaches to the  diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer."
"9172938","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Homeostatic signaling systems are believed to interface with the mechanisms of learning-related plasticity to achieve stable, yet flexible, neural function and animal behavior. As such, homeostatic signaling systems are also widely believed to participate in the cause and progression of neurological disease. Yet, direct connections to disease can only be achieved once there is a clear understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive homeostatic plasticity. The homeostatic modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release is an evolutionarily conserved form of homeostatic signaling that is observed in organisms ranging from fly to human. This form of homeostatic plasticity is under bi-directional control. Homeostatic signaling mechanisms can potentiate neurotransmitter release or depress neurotransmitter release, thereby stabilizing synaptic transmission and neural function in response to a wide range of perturbations. In this grant we identify the very first molecular mechanisms responsible for presynaptic homeostatic depression in any organism. In a large-scale, electrophysiology-based, unbiased, forward genetic screen we have identified a secreted, Ig-domain containing protein that is necessary for presynaptic homeostatic depression. Furthermore, two interacting extracellular proteins have also been identified. Thus, we may have identified a novel, trans- synaptic signaling system for the control of homeostatic depression. In this grant, we have also identified a separate molecular mechanism that limits the extent of homeostatic depression. We have identified a synaptic kinase and auxiliary subunit of the presynaptic calcium channel that are necessary to prevent over- compensation. In the absence of these genes, homeostatic depression proceeds unchecked causing a dramatic impairment of neurotransmission. To date, nothing is known about how homeostatic signaling is limited in any system. Thus, we may have identified a novel form of homeostatic feedback control that limits the extent of presynaptic homeostatic depression. In conclusion, we propose to characterize completely novel mechanisms of synaptic modulation with potential relevance to the cause and progression of neurological disease."
"9167870","  Project Significance:  The faithful segregation of genetic material during cell division is critical for sustaining life. This becomes apparent if one considers that a 70-year old adult has used on average 1000 trillion (1020) cells, which were generated by an equal number of successful cell divisions. In contrast, chromosome segregation and cell division errors can lead to aneuploidy, yielding non- viable cells, genetic disorders or cancer. Cell division is orchestrated by the mitotic spindle, which is composed of a plethora of microtubules (MT) and MT associated proteins (MAP). First, the mitotic spindle captures and aligns chromosomes at the spindle equator. This is achieved via a bundle of MTs, which form the kinetochore-fiber (K-fiber) and connect the kinetochore (KT) of each sister chromatid with opposite cell poles. Next, sister chromatids are split and K-fibers pull sister chromatids to opposite cell poles. Despite 130 years of research on mitosis, it is not clear how the mitotic spindle is assembled and how it obtains its characteristic bipolar shape that is critical for accurate chromosome segregation. Most importantly, it is not understood how KTs are captured in the vast volume of a cell and aligned at its center. It also remains unknown how a threshold force is reached and transmitted via K-fibers to split and segregate sister chromatids and how errors occur.  Answers to these questions are needed to explain how cells divide and thus procreate life, and may provide new treatments for diseases that lie at the heart of cell proliferation, such as cancer and cell regeneration. Here, I devise a holistic approach to overcome these experimental limitations and advance our understanding of chromosome segregation and its errors to a biochemical level. I will achieve this by breaking down the problem into the individual MT nucleation pathways that are required for spindle assembly and characterize these pathways at the single molecule level in vitro. This leaves us in the unprecedented position to start combining MT nucleation pathways. Thereby, we will build the mitotic spindle in vitro to not only to determine the molecular organization of the mitotic spindle, but also to elucidate the mechanisms by which K-fibers capture and segregate chromosomes and the causes of segregation errors. Finally, my research will explain how hundreds of proteins can self-assemble on the nm scale into a complex molecular machine 1000-fold larger than its constituents, a challenge for the biochemistry of the 21st century."
"9174033","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Hippo signaling pathway is a fundamental regulator of organ growth and homeostasis. Specifically, the downstream effector of this pathway, Yap (and its homolog Taz), has been implicated in the maintenance of stem cells and in the regulation of liver size. Although under normal physiological conditions, hepatocytes serve as the main source of cell replenishment in the liver, certain surgical and chemical injury conditions have been shown to cause the expansion of atypical ductal progenitor cells. In previously published work, we have shown that modifications in Yap expression can reprogram hepatocyte to a ductal phenotype, however the nature of how Yap activity regulates biliary ductal progenitors in native conditions within the liver is currently unknown. I have shown that Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), one of the most widely characterized targets of the hippo-signaling pathway and a bona-fide reporter for Yap transcriptional activity, is expressed heterogeneously in ductal progenitor cells in the liver. Additionally, I have shown that Yap activity is required for organoid initiation and growth in three-dimensional cultures. Finally, I have also shown that Yap activity is upregulated in expanded ductal cells after chemical injury. The overarching goal of this proposal is therefore to investigate how Yap and Taz regulate and maintain liver ductal progenitor cells. It also hopes to identify the role of Yap and Taz in the ductal response to well-established liver injury models. Through my continued research on this project, I hope to take advantage of all of the resources available to me at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard University. Additionally, I hope to continue developing as a scientist and gathering knowledge in the area of tissue regeneration and organ maintenance. As can be seen in the work I have already performed for this proposal and for the work that I will continue to do,  I am committed to a scientific career where I will be devoted to advancing basic science to directly impact human health. This proposed work will hopefully contribute to a broader understanding of cellular maintenance in the liver and the mechanism by which the liver responds to injury. The isolation and examination of liver progenitor cells that can be cultured indefinitely in-vitro (and the downstream mechanisms by which these cells are maintained), may also pave the way for cellular therapies for liver disease. Additionally, this work may help furthe our understanding of the basic processes and cellular maintenance required for the upkeep of a vital organ in our bodies."
"9213760","ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder caused by progressive loss of dopamine- producing neurons in the substantia nigra. One of the main problems in treating PD is the lack of early biomarkers that would provide crucial information for making practical decisions on treatment and prevention plans for individual patients. Our main goal is to demonstrate that indices of stability of motor actions (indices of synergies) can and should be used as theory-based, quantitative, and objective biomarkers of PD. Our recent studies using the framework of the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis to quantify synergies have shown that PD patients demonstrate impaired synergies (low stability of action) and impaired ability to adjust synergies in preparation to action (delayed and reduced anticipatory synergy adjustments, ASAs). In a few patients at stage-I (Hoehn-Yahr) of PD, changes in synergies and ASAs were seen during actions involving body parts without clinical signs of the disease. These results suggest that studying synergies may yields objective biomarkers that are able to detect and quantify impaired motor function in PD and may be sensitive to pre-motor-symptom stages of the disease. We plan to collect pilot data to support this hypothesis by studying a group of drug-naïve patients at stage-I (Hoehn-Yahr) of PD. Testing drug-naïve patients will allow disambiguating effects of PD from possible effects of long-term exposure to drugs on the non-symptomatic extremities. We also plan to determine the effects of dopamine replacement therapy on these indices. Our main specific hypotheses are: (1) Drug- naïve patients with PD stage-I will show reduced synergy indices and shorter, delayed ASAs as compared to healthy controls in both symptomatic and non-symptomatic hands/arms; and (2) These indices will be sensitive to dopamine-replacement drugs. Two specific aims will test the main hypotheses. Aim 1: To demonstrate and quantify changes in synergic control in symptomatic and asymptomatic extremities of newly diagnosed, drug-naïve HY stage-I PD patients. We will quantify indices of multi-finger synergies stabilizing total force and multi-joint synergies stabilizing hand trajectory in both upper extremities. We expect the synergy indices to be reduced similarly on both sides compared to controls. We also predict delayed and reduced ASAs in PD. Aim 2: To demonstrate and quantify the effectiveness of dopamine-replacement therapy in improving synergic control in PD patients. Studies described under Aim-1 will be repeated one hour after taking carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 regular, gold standard for dopaminergic replacement. We plan to show positive effects of the drug on the synergy indices across If successful, these results will help us to optimize design of a longer prospective study that would test the prognostic value of changed multi-finger and multi-joint synergies by following prospectively a large group of early-stage PD patients over several years to explore how synergy indices predict the occurrence of clinical symptoms such as emergence of symptoms on the less-affected body side, postural instability, and freezing of gait. tasks. We view the impaired synergies in the upper extremities as early reflections of a general disruption of the mechanisms of synergic control, which later leads to effects in other body parts including those involved in postural and locomotion tasks."
"9325991","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visualizing the structures of biological molecular machines is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of cellular function. Cryo-EM is an emergent structural biology technique that is ideally suited to study large macromolecular assemblies, even if they are only available in minute amounts, or if multiple states co-exist in th sample. The cryo-EM field has just entered a new era with the use of high-end electron microscopes coupled to new direct electron detection devices (DDDs) that has led to high resolution structural information, in some cases from only one or a few imaging sessions. As technical barriers open up and the field matures, the impact of new cryo-EM studies will more and more be defined by the output of biological insight. Such will be measured by the relevance of the biological system under study and by whether the experimental strategy is able to provide answers to key functional questions. This scenario requires the synergistic integration of cryo-EM and biochemical expertise in the context of studies that address fundamental biological questions. This program project brings together such set of complementary expertise and provides a mechanism to integrate them seamlessly to tackle biological studies of great medical significance, providing a supportive and coherent environment that promotes interactions among the different projects and advances each of them individually, as well as the cryo-EM field as a whole. This Program Project also provides a mechanism whereby the large costs of operating high-end electron microscopes, associated equipment and computational capabilities are effectively shared among a number of research projects that rely on such state-of-the-art instrumentation. As cryo-EM and image reconstruction are still developing rapidly, optimal use of this methodology requires rigorous retraining and is best facilitated by specialized support personnel and intensive discussion among members of a collaborative group as proposed in this program project.  Our ultimate goal is to maintain and enhance Berkeley's contributions to the structural biology field. We will support and employ a physical and intellectual infrastructure  that allows us to carry out state-of-the-art cryo-EM studies of essential macromolecular complexes and push the capabilities of the cryo-EM technique. This proposal capitalizes on (1) the tradition of innovation and risk-taking within our PPG and years of leadership and expertise in the field of biological electron microscopy and structural biology, (2) the implementation at Berkeley of recent technical breakthroughs in the cryo-EM field (e.g. DDDs, automation, Bayesian methods of image processing), (3) unique biochemical expertise in a large number of biological systems of outstanding biomedical relevance, and (4) the unique local computer resources at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), which is hosted at LBNL."
"9237785","ABSTRACT Opioid misuse/abuse remains at unprecedented levels and is a major public health burden. Stress-reactivity interferes with opioid abstinence and increase risks of relapse and adverse outcomes. We have shown that the pharmacological stressor yohimbine + hydrocortisone (YOH/CORT) increases opioid seeking in buprenorphine (BUP)-stabilized volunteers. Prior studies suggest maintenance on methadone (MTD) and BUP can attenuate stress-reactivity, but those studies have several limitations. BUP is effective via opioid substitution (withdrawal suppression) and cross-tolerance (blockade); another important but poorly understood mechanism is that BUP might afford stress-protection. In our studies, reactivity to YOH/CORT (which co-activates noradrenaline and glucocorticoid systems) was found for some measures but not others; this suggests moderate-dose BUP has a partial blocking effect on stress reactivity. Although stress plays a role in drug seeking/relapse, one research gap is that no studies have examined whether BUP (or MTD) dose-dependently attenuates stress reactivity in subjects with opioid use disorder. Improving treatment outcomes requires that we identify opioid-abusing patients with elevated relapse risk to address their susceptibility. Yet, few studies have examined whether chronic stress biomarker levels or acute stress-reactivity predicts relapse and consequences in subjects with opioid use disorder. In this project, we will determine whether maintenance on varying buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NAL) doses reduces YOH/CORT dose-related reactivity (phase 1: within-subject crossover), then use these data to predict opioid relapse and consequences during a standardized outpatient BUP/NAL dose taper paired with opioid abstinence-contingent reinforcement, and at 1, 2 and 3 months follow up (phase 2: intent-to- treat). We predict: (1a) YOH/CORT will increase opioid price-inelasticity (greater economic demand), elevate acute stress biomarkers (e.g. blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline, saliva cortisol, negative mood) and novel indices predicted to be sensitive based on non-opioid studies (e.g. blood levels of BDNF and pro-inflammatory cytokines; saliva ?-amylase); (1b) BUP/NAL will dose-dependently block YOH/CORT stress-reactivity; (2a) stress-reactivity at lower-dose BUP/NAL will predict more opioid use and adverse consequences during and after BUP/NAL dose tapering; and chronic stress indices (e.g. hair cortisol level, questionnaire responses) will modulate YOH/CORT reactivity (1c) and relapse (2b). Impact of this project will be exceptional because: opioid use problems remain at critical levels and stress-related opioid use is poorly understood, posing a major clinical challenge; the highly innovative idea that BUP affords stress protection will be tested using rigorous methods (placebo controlled, dose-response drug-interaction design) with established and novel biomarkers, and mediators/moderators of stress-reactivity will be used to predict relapse potential to bridge a large translational gap. This project offers a novel template to examine effects of stressors on drug seeking and relapse biomarkers, and to develop treatment approaches to reduce stress-potentiated drug use."

Building off of our success and following the stated goal of eMERGE III, our CC will continue as a hub for the Network by maintaining all of our current functions and evolving with the Network. The CC will remain responsible for cross-study functions, conducting quality control analyses of sequencing data, harmonizing data across studies, supporting cross-study analyses as needed, managing and upgrading the eMERGE Network website (gwas.org), facilitating outside collaborations, and organizing the logistics of the collaborative programs. As the eMERGE mission extends genomic discoveries research into genomic medicine practice research, we will bring both continuity and freshly envisioned innovations to support this important work, as illustrated in five proposed specific aims: (1) Extending informatics tools to accelerate phenotyping and facilitate end-to-end genomic medicine research. (2) Integrate high quality genomic information across eMERGE sites. (3) Secure EMR and genomic data sharing risk mitigation. (4) Provide excellent logistical support to the entire expanded network; including committees, work groups, NHGRI and the ESP. And finally, in keeping pace with national dynamics, we add (5) Synergize with other related networks to eliminate redundancy, promote cross pollination of best practices, and share eMERGE tools."
"9272232","Project Summary  It has been estimated that 1.4 million people in the United States suffer from Lewy body dementia (LBD), including both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Patients with LBD suffer from cognitive decline, sometimes linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the motor and behavioral changes seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of LBD can be difficult, particularly in those DLB patients that present with cognitive impairment prior to motor or marked behavioral changes. Biomarkers for LBD are few and their value in diagnosis, prognosis, and for treatment response is limited.  Impediments to biomarker development in LBD have included small subject numbers, a lack of systematic patient characterization, and a failure to perform longitudinal follow up with autopsy. Both AD and PD have benefited from a number of large ?consortiums? that have advanced research by leveraging the strengths of several groups of research centers to combine efforts with standardized approaches to the study of the disease. One good example is the Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC) program, funded by the National Institute on Aging, where over 30 research centers across the United States have agreed to a standardized approach to the diagnosis and characterization of patients with AD. Other similar programs include the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP), and the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). Fortunately, the latter two PD programs have included more systematic clinical assessments and collection of biofluids and imaging data relevant to cognition in PD. Recently, a pathology component has been added to the PPMI project. No similar program exists for DLB.  The objective of this proposal is to establish a consortium of centers for the study of DLB with a large number of subject enrolled, systematic assessments (compatible with AD and PD programs), collection of biofluids and imaging data, and ultimately autopsy. The DLB consortium (DLBC) would create the necessary foundation for biomarker development and have the secondary benefit of creating an ongoing subject sample available for additional translational and therapeutic studies. We have brought together nine centers with expertise in the Lewy body disorders and with strong connections to the Lewy body dementia research and general community to participate in the DLBC. This group of investigators has collaborated extensively together for many years and will provide the foundation for this much needed resource."
"9173813","This revised application proposes to study the efficacy of a multivitamin and cocoa extract supplementation in prevention of cataract and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), two leading causes of visual impairment in US adults. Recent findings from the Physicians? Health Study II, the only large-scale clinical trial of a daily multivitamin, indicated a significant reduction in cataract, but an elevated, though statistically non-significant, increased risk of AMD. These findings in men require confirmation in other men and extension to women. The proposed study will utilize resources and data from the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial testing a patented, high-quality cocoa extract supplement (Mars Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged ?65 years and 6,000 men aged ?60 years with 4 years of treatment and follow-up. Woman participants will be drawn from the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI) cohort, and male participants will be drawn from a target population screened for participation (but not randomized) in the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). Beginning in June, 2015 and continuing through 2016, willing and eligible respondents to an invitational mailing will be enrolled in a 3-month run-in. Those who demonstrate good compliance with pill taking during the run-in, and remain willing and eligible, will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for 5 years. At 1-year intervals, participants will receive a new supply of pills and a follow-up questionnaire on compliance, possible side effects, and incidence of endpoints. We propose to document incident cataract and prevalent and incident AMD endpoints in the COSMOS cohort in order to evaluate the efficacy of multivitamin and cocoa extract supplements in cataract and AMD prevention. The primary aims of the proposed study are to test whether 1) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of cataract; 2) a daily multivitamin will reduce the risk of total AMD events, a composite of incident AMD plus cases of progression to advanced AMD (neovascular AMD plus central geographic atrophy) among participants with prevalent AMD at baseline. The effect of cocoa extract supplements (capsule containing 750 mg/d flavanols, including 75 mg (-)-epicatechin, and 90 mg theobromine) in reducing risks of AMD and cataract will be examined as secondary aims. This research is responsive to a program priority of the National Eye Institute?s Strategic Plan to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of eye disease. We believe the proposed eye disease ancillary to COSMOS offers a unique opportunity to obtain a reliable, efficient, and informative evaluation of the efficacy of two extremely promising preventive agents for cataract and AMD at a fraction of the cost of separate trials."
"9194683","Nonhuman primates (NHPs) serve a crucial role in translational research as animal models for exploring the pathogenesis of infectious and noninfectious diseases, and for testing of biologic therapies and vaccines. While many human diagnostic immunologic reagents cross react with the primate species commonly employed in translational research, gaps exist for a substantial number of reagent targets. Furthermore, antibodies that target specific immune functions or deplete specific lymphocyte subpopulations in vivo have proven valuable in defining disease mechanisms or can be used as proof-of-concept for new therapies. For the past 15 years, the NIH Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource has responded to needs of the scientific community by developing, manufacturing and distributing NHP- specific reagents for in vitro diagnostics and for in vivo use. Utilization of this resource has grown dramatically since this program's inception. During the last budget year, we fulfilled 500 reagent requests from 126 investigators and distributed over 300 grams of recombinant antibody for administration to NHPs. Taking advantage of scientific advances and technological improvements in antibody development, engineering, expression and vectoring, we will continue to support the scientific community utilizing NHP models across all scientific disciplines.  "
"9238037","ABSTRACT Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are highly pathogenic type species of the Henipavirus (HNV) genus within the Paramyxovirinae. Zoonotic transmission of NiV and HeV from their natural fruit bat reservoirs to humans can result in mortality rates in excess of 90%. Originally thought to be limited to Southeast Asia and Australia, the recent discovery of numerous divergent clades of HNVs across Africa, and of Henipa-like viruses (HNLV) in China such as the Mojiang paramyxovirus (MojPV), qualitatively changes the risk- calculus associated with the possible global emergence of these zoonotic viruses. Indeed, we recently found evidence for HNV spillover into human populations at high-risk for zoonotic transmission in Cameroon, which raise urgent questions about potential spillover events that may have remained undetected or misdiagnosed. The recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover and transmission of highly pathogenic emerging viruses. HNVs use EphrinB2 and EphrinB3, highly conserved cellular proteins, as viral entry receptors. The recent discovery of novel HNVs with differential usage of EphrinB2 and B3 provides new opportunities to study how receptor usage contributes to the pathogenicity and potential for zoonotic spillover of these emergent HNVs. Our overall goal is to elucidate the envelope-receptor interactions of HNVs and HNLVs that contribute to viral tropism, pathogenicity, transmissibility, and the potential for zoonotic spillover. Our primary objective is to understand the structure-function correlates of envelope- receptor interactions in the pathobiology of HNV/HNLV zoonotic infections. A secondary objective is to leverage that understanding to interrogate the rational basis for a vaccine design that might elicit antibodies that are more broadly neutralizing and effective against an ever-expanding spectrum of diverse HNVs. Our driving hypothesis is: the structural plasticity of HNV-Gs accounts for the differential efficiency and choice of receptor usage exhibited by divergent HNVs, and that this contributes to a virulence spectrum among these zoonotic viruses that is equally diverse. To achieve our objectives and interrogate our driving hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims:  (1) Investigate the role of receptor usage and choice in virus pathogenicity.  (2) Evaluate how attachment protein-receptor interactions contribute to transmissibility and the  potential for zoonotic spillover.  (3) Examine the implications of the structural and phylogenetic diversity of HNVs on vaccine design."
"9256313","The goal of this project is to develop a quantitative molecular breast imaging PET (QMBI-PET) scanner to improve the way in which breast cancer therapies are matched to individual patients by providing evaluation of therapy efficacy during the window of opportunity between diagnosis and surgical resection. More than 250,000 women in the US with invasive disease start therapy for breast cancer each year. In 2016 approximately 40,000 deaths will result from breast cancer. Unfortunately, despite the successes of targeted therapies, the relapse rate in patients expressing the targets and receiving these therapies still approaches 50% for certain phenotypes. The drugs can be very costly, and carry toxic side effects. There are currently 68 FDA approved breast cancer drugs, the most of any cancer. PET holds great promise to improve therapy selection, thereby sparing patients from ultimately ineffective drugs and directing them more quickly to effective regimens, thus improving patient outcomes, and reducing costs via a more efficient therapy selection process. However, all of the studies thus far using PET to assess therapy response have been limited to the quantitative accuracy of clinical whole-body PET scanners A compact, lower-cost, high resolution, and quantitatively accurate PET imaging scanner will help inform the physician's choices of effective therapies for breast cancer patients. Early evaluation of a therapy's effectiveness will help the treating physician individualize a patient's treatment: In the neo-adjuvant setting or the window of opportunity between diagnosis and surgery, a baseline (pre-treatment) PET image will be taken, then, after a short regimen of a targeted therapy, a second PET scan will be used to evaluate response to treatment. This will be used to guide selection and aggressiveness of post-surgery therapy. For this treatment paradigm to become broadly accepted and widely used, the minimum viable commercial scanner needs to be higher resolution, more compact, and less expensive than standard whole-body PET scanners. In addition a high level of quantitative accuracy is needed. We propose a high-resolution quantitative molecular breast imaging PET (QMBI-PET) scanner, which uses a an advanced detector architecture and statistical-based 3D imaging to acquire high-sensitivity, high-resolution images. The outcome of this Phase-I application will be a functional laboratory tested single-ring prototype scanner, with initial data on clinical feasibility to provide evidence for commercialization in the following phase of this development."
"9151815","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural hospitals experience unique difficulties with effective and accurate application of evidence-based patient safety solutions.1-4 Patient safety concerns arising from the identification and management of acute time-sensitive critical conditions in rural Emergency Departments (ED) are especially concerning given the high probability of harm or even death when errors occur. Well-established, evidence-based guidelines for identification and safe management of acute, time-sensitive critical conditions in the ED, such as acute sepsis, have been developed in large academic centers, yet there remain significant disparities in effective and accurate implementation and application of these guidelines and outcomes in rural EDs.2,3,5,6 Telemedicine provides a unique approach for delivering consistent, safe care to patients across all settings: from large academic to small rura hospitals.7,8 Use of telemedicine to improve patient safety in rural EDs provides unique opportunities, but also significant operational challenges, as these EDs experience continuous change with respect to patient volume, presentations of clinical conditions, as well as clinician expertise, experience, and staffing. In situ simulation, simulation that takes place in the live, operational, clinical setting with clinicians performing their real roles, provides the ability to rain and evaluate the integration of new technology, such as telemedicine, along with care guidelines, such as the acute sepsis bundle, into clinical practice and workflow. The goal of this project will be to evaluate if in situ simulation improves adoption and use of telemedicine to support implementation of the Acute Sepsis Bundle, to improve the safe delivery of care in rural EDs. We will conduct a prospective delayed intervention study to evaluate the impact of the optimized Telemedicine Acute Sepsis Bundle in two rural EDs within the Order of St. Francis (OSF) Healthcare System. The large academic center within OSF Healthcare is currently engaged in a process improvement effort to improve with safety of sepsis care, has developed and piloted an Acute Sepsis Bundle, and is committed to using telemedicine to improve dissemination in the OSF-affiliated rural hospital EDs. This project will develop, pilot, and finalize an in situ simulation training program to first tailor an optimized Telemedicine Acute Sepsis Bundle for each rural ED, and then train rural ED clinicians to integrate this new technology and care process into their workflow. We will evaluate the impact of in situ simulation on both (1) process measures: telemedicine and Acute Sepsis Bundle delivery, and (2) clinical outcomes: sepsis mortality and intensive care unit length of stay. Results will be disseminated in an In situ Simulation for Patient Safety Toolkit. This project will produce results that can be easily translated to the implementation of other new technologies and care processes targeting acute, time- sensitive critical conditions, such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute decompensated heart failure, pediatric critical care, and trauma, to improve patient safety in the country's many rural EDs."
"9163308","The last twenty years of brain imaging research has for the first time revealed the functional organization of the human brain in detail. We now know the function and location of dozens of regions of the brain that were not known 20 years ago. Many of these regions are involved in very specific components of cognition, such as the visual perception of color and motion, the visual recognition of faces, places, and bodies, and even high-level mental processes like understanding the meaning of sentence or thinking about what another person is thinking. Yet this tantalizing new map of the human mind and brain raises a pressing, unanswered question: How does all this precise functional organization get wired up in infancy and childhood? When and how does each little patch of cortex take on its distinctive adult function? Is the function of a given cortical region determined by the pre-existing connectivity of that region to the rest of the brain? How plastic is cortical organization in the event of early brain injury? To answer these questions, we will conduct extensive, longitudinal anatomical and functional scanning of children from birth through age 5. This work was not possible until now because it requires several very recent technical advances, including the new ?connectome? scanner at MGH that offers the resolution connectivity maps of the human brain of any scanner in the world, new methods of anatomical imaging in neonates, functional imaging in young infants, and longitudinal registration of brain images from the same person from birth to adulthood. These methods will enable us to test whether the cortical location of each functional region, when scanned at age 4-8, can be predicted from the distinctive connectivity of the same region (registered within subjects across age) at birth. By further including children with focal perinatal strokes, we can test the plasticity of specific cortical regions, versus white matter connections of those regions, in the eventual development of adult functional organization. This work will answer fundamental questions about how the human brain gets wired up over infancy and childhood that are also of great clinical relevance given the high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders in which this development goes awry."
"9199272","Immune-mediated pulmonary fibrosis occurs in patients with diffuse lung diseases such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). The mechanism(s) by which chronic inflammation causes lung fibrosis is poorly understood. In addition, there are no effective therapies that prevent development or arrest progression of fibrotic lung disease. HP is a T cell-mediated inflammatory lung disease caused by repeated exposure to an inhaled antigen such as mammalian proteins, bacteria and fungi and is the prototypical example of chronic lung inflammation resulting in fibrosis. Fibrotic lung disease occurs in up to 41% of patients with HP resulting in irreversible pulmonary dysfunction and a median survival of 7.1 years. Interestingly, patients with pulmonary fibrosis related to HP tend to be older (Mean: 61 years-old) than non-fibrotic patients (Mean: 52 years-old) suggesting that older patients may be at increased risk of developing fibrotic lung disease caused by chronic exposure to inhaled antigens. We developed a murine model of HP to study the role of different T cell subsets in the generation of immune-mediated pulmonary fibrosis. In this model, ?? T cells reduce lung inflammation and subsequent fibrosis by limiting the expansion of pro-fibrotic CXCR3-expressing CD4+ T cells caused by repeated exposure to the ubiquitous environmental microorganism, Bacillus subtilis. We identified IL22 expression as a critical mechanism by which ?? T cells reduce B. subtilis-induced disease. Mice transgenic for ?? T cells and wild-type C57BL/6 mice have large expansions of IL22-expressing ?? T lymphocytes in the lung resulting in decreased inflammation and fibrosis. In the absence of ?? T cells and thus, reduced levels of IL22, TCR?-/- mice have increased cellular infiltrates and accelerated lung fibrosis. In the absence of CXCR3 expression by CD4+ T cells, CXCR3-/- mice have less collagen deposition in the lung in response to chronic exposure to inhaled B. subtilis. Reconstitution of TCR?-/-?-/- mice with CD4+CXCR3+ T cells followed by repeated inhalation of B. subtilis resulted in increased lung fibrosis relative to TCR?-/-?-/- mice reconstituted with CD4+CXCR3- T cells while TCR?-/-?-/- mice repeatedly exposed to inhaled B. subtilis in the absence of T cells did not develop significant inflammation or fibrosis. Collectively, these data suggest that CD4+CXCR3+ T cells are important in the pathogenesis of B. subtilis-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Since older individuals are at risk for developing lung fibrosis in HP, we will test the hypothesis that older mice will develop increased pulmonary fibrosis after chronic exposure to inhaled B. subtilis due to a lack of expansion of anti-inflammatory ?? T cells that results in further expansion of pro-fibrotic CD4+CXCR3+ T cells."
"9143142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Affordable Care Act (ACA) called for every state in the United States (US) to significantly expand Medicaid coverage to individuals at ?138% of the federal poverty level by 2014. In a 2012 legal challenge, the Supreme Court ruled that states were not required to implement the ACA-sponsored Medicaid expansion; thus (by December 31, 2014), only 27 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid, while 23 states did not. Little is known about the impact of ACA-sponsored Medicaid expansions on access to and changes in receipt of healthcare services among vulnerable populations. Yet this knowledge is essential to informing deliberations in `non-expansion' states regarding whether to expand their Medicaid programs, and will also be helpful to `expansion' states eager to learn about the impact of their expansions. The natural experiment created by the Supreme Court decision to make expansion optional for states provides a unique opportunity to assess the extent to which Medicaid expansions improve access to healthcare for low-income patients and other vulnerable populations. The proposed project will be one of the first to examine changes in access to and receipt of healthcare services and to Medicaid expenditures following ACA Medicaid expansions among a large population of safety net clinic patients. We will use electronic health record data (EHR) from the OCHIN practice-based research network, which serve >1 million patients in 442 community health centers (CHCs) in 8 expansion states and 8 non-expansion states. Moreover, using CHC data from the 8 expansion-states, we will examine differences in utilization among patients gaining new Medicaid coverage (newly insured), as compared to those already insured by Medicaid (already insured) and those who remain uninsured (uninsured). Finally, building on our prior work, we will link EHR data from the 213 OCHIN clinics in Oregon to Medicaid administrative claim data to assess overall healthcare utilization (including care received outside of CHCs, such as hospitalization) and to compare Medicaid expenditures among newly insured individuals versus those already insured. We will study insurance coverage, healthcare utilization, and Medicaid expenditures addressing the following specific aims: Aim 1: compare pre-post health insurance status, primary care, mental health, and dental visits, and receipt of preventive services, as well as changes in payer mix among OCHIN CHCs in states that did and did not expand Medicaid; Aim 2: Examine pre-post utilization of CHC services (including receipt of preventive services) by newly insured patients compared to already insured patients and uninsured patients; and, Aim 3: Measure pre-post Medicaid expansion changes in overall utilization of healthcare services and costs to the Oregon Medicaid program among newly insured compared to already insured. The findings from this project will be extremely relevant to policy and practice, informing further improvements in the US healthcare system to ensure access to healthcare for vulnerable populations."

The Program consists of 19 members from  eight departments in the Perelman School of Medicine and the School of Arts and Sciences. These members  have $9M in cancer-related grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $7.5M is peer-reviewed and $4.6M is  NCI-funded. During the current project period, members published 316 cancer-related papers, of which 9%  were the result of intra-Programmatic collaborations, 51% were the result of inter-Programmatic collaborations,  and 34% were multi-institutional."
"9236094","Abstract Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness among US adults between the ages of 20 and 74 years. Laser photocoagulation surgery has been established as an effective way of treating retinopathy if it is detected early. Yearly retinal screening examinations are a potent tool in the battle to reduce the incidence of blindness from diabetic retinopathy because they provide diabetic patients with timely diagnoses and consequently, the potential for timely treatment. Primary care safety net clinics provide monitoring and other services for diabetic patients but they are often not equipped to provide specialty care services such as retinal screenings. Access to specialists who can provide retinal screenings can be increased through the use of telemedicine, which has shown great promise as a means of screening for diabetic retinopathy in the US and internationally. A pilot study by Charles Drew University investigators had a total of 2,876 teleretinal screenings performed for diabetic retinopathy, with 2,732 unique diabetic patients from six South Los Angeles safety net clinics screened. The present study aims to build on this prior work by: (a) developing novel software that utilizes information from clinical records to detect latent diabetic retinopathy in diabetic patients who have not yet received an annual eye examination, and (b) devising methods to speed up the diabetic retinopathy detection process for diabetic patients who have had digital retinal images taken by partially automating the process using image processing and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop predictive models for diabetic retinopathy using risk factors collected from patient clinical records. 2. Develop predictive models for automated diabetic retinopathy assessment using a combination of patient  risk factor data and data from digital retinal images previously evaluated by experts. 3. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of: a) the models developed for specific aim 2, and, b) the assessments of  optometrist readers against standard of care dilated retinal examinations by board certified  ophthalmologists for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a new Los Angeles County reading center. 4. Create web-based software tools based on the predictive models developed in specific aim 1 that can be  used to initiate outreach to high-risk patients in under-resourced settings, boosting detection rates for those  patients who are most at risk for diabetic retinopathy. 5. Establish targeted outreach methods to promote screening for patients that the predictive models from  specific aim 1 identify as potentially having undetected diabetic retinopathy."
"9226309","PROJET SUMMARY Prevalence and incidence of late-onset Alzheimer?s disease (LOAD) are higher in admixed population such as Caribbean Hispanics (CH) and African-Americans (AA) than in non-Hispanic Whites. Admixture occurs when isolated populations begin interbreeding for historical or social events, and their offspring are mixtures of the genetic materials of the founding populations, resulting in mosaic chromosomes. Admixture can be a valuable source of statistical power to map disease-associated genes when the disease has different frequency across populations, such as LOAD. Investigations in other conditions (cardiovascular diseases, glaucoma, asthma) demonstrated the importance of admixture mapping and a recent study on AA showed the significant contribution of African ancestry in LOAD. This has never been performed in Hispanics. In our previous investigation, we performed a large genome-wide association study in Caribbean Hispanics: a novel locus in the FBXL7 gene was found to be associated with LOAD, along with other known-loci previously identified in large GWAS of European ancestry. This new finding implicates additional mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of LOAD, and demonstrates the valuable asset of admixed populations in advancing the understanding of the disease. Preliminary results indicate that in our Caribbean Hispanic sample, LOAD cases have higher African ancestry as compared to healthy controls, matching previous reports in African Americans. Given these premises, we hypothesize that genetic loci with excess ancestry with respect to LOAD contribute to the observed higher frequency of LOAD in Caribbean Hispanics. This is based on the assumption that causal variants leading to increased risk occur more frequently on chromosomal segments (?ancestral blocks?) inherited from the ancestral population that has higher disease risk. Capitalizing on the large sample of individuals with extensive phenotype and genetic data, a two-layers approach of fine mapping will be carried out: first, we will conduct admixture mapping in GWAS data in order to identify genetic loci with risk profiles for LOAD that differ by ancestry (Aim 1). Secondly, we will conduct analyses in WES data (Aim 2) focusing on those loci prioritize by analyses conducted in the previous aim. Ultimately, we will seek to functionally characterize the newly discovered genetic loci by investigating their role in app processing, tau proteostasis and synaptic function (Aim 3)."
"9169557","PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to learn a language is a core human trait. Yet, the study of its neurobiological underpinnings has faced a major roadblock for hundreds of years - a tractable mammalian model system to study this function has never been established. The reason is that vocal learning abilities are remarkably sparse and out of over 5400 existing mammalian species only a select few possess vocal learning abilities, these are cetaceans, elephants and bats, with initial evidence of vocal development only recently emerging in non-human primates. Thus, all detailed neurobiological investigation of vocal learning focused on the avian brain. While this body of work produced invaluable insight, evolutionary divergence between avian and mammalian brains makes translating findings from birds to humans challenging. For example, the avian equivalent of cortex has a nuclear organization, which is very different from the six-layered cortex of mammals. A mammalian model system is thus imperatively needed to bridge this major gap. Therefore the goal of this proposal is to directly overcome this challenge by establishing bats as the first mammalian model system for studying the neural basis of vocal learning. Our investigations target key cortical areas that are involved in auditory perception and vocal production - two key requirements of vocal learning. These are the auditory and frontal cortices. Bats are further an attractive model system because many behavioral aspects of their vocal learning share many resemblances with those of human language learning. To facilitate our studies we advance three major aims that would enable detailed neurobiological investigation of vocal learning. First, we design a high-throughput, automated vocal-learning paradigm for bats. This system allows unprecedented control over bat vocal learning and targets core features of human vocal learning, such as vocal-motor plasticity at both the laryngeal source and vocal tract. We further use this paradigm in combination with immunohistochemistry to identify candidate brain areas that may participate in vocal learning. Second, we use our development of wireless electrophysiological methods to monitor at millisecond resolution the coding properties of mammalian cortical neurons during vocal learning. This approach will provide both the first description of mammalian cortical computations underlying vocal learning as well as enable a direct comparison to studies in birds and identify generalizable neural mechanisms between birds and mammals. Third, we use cellular-resolution calcium imaging to longitudinally monitor cortical networks throughout the vocal learning process. These experiments will facilitate the first description of the emergence of cortical responses and anatomical topographies during vocal learning. Ultimately, our research program will provide a detailed description of the mammalian neural computations that support our ability to learn language, but it should help us also understand the causes of disorders directly related to speech and language development and aid in the design of more effective therapeutic approaches that will be applicable to humans."
"9254310","Genben Lifesciences (dba GB HealthWatch) is a digital health and nutritional genomics company. Our mission is to help fight common, diet- and lifestyle-related chronic diseases with precision nutrition and advanced mobile technologies. Our company developed the HealthWatch 360 mobile app for tracking dietary intake, physical activity and health-related symptoms. This mobile app has received excellent reviews for both the iOS and Android platforms and has over 70,000 registered users. Health condition- specific goals featured in the app provide refined nutritional recommendations based on clinical guidelines for the prevention of diet-induced, chronic diseases. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the U.S., the 6th leading cause of mortality and a major cost to the nation, families and caregivers. This phase I proposal is for the development of a mobile tool that will deliver personalized nutrition and meal plans based on genetic risk in order to mitigate AD risk. Aim 1: Develop a systematic process to identify specific dietary and nutritional components associated with AD. Using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database and nutritional analyses of the traditional diets that correspond with the 26 populations, we will analyze whether specific nutrients correlate with the frequency of genetic variants that predispose risk of AD. We hypothesize that a population?s fitness would be enhanced and AD risk would be lower when the genetic variants that are selected for in a given population are in equilibrium with a diet that is enriched or depleted with the correlated nutrient(s). We will develop statistical models that will quantify these relationships. Aim 2: Translate nutritional patterns to a set of quantitative recommendations for AD prevention. With the nutrient data we obtain from Aim 1, combined with other evidence-based nutrition guidelines for AD, we will synthesize a set of qualitative and quantitative nutritional ?rules? based on the app user?s genotypes, family history of AD and other health conditions. These genotype- and/or phenotype - specific rules will estimate ideal ranges for a given nutrient and amend the conventional ?rules? (i.e. nutritional recommendations) by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for America. Aim 3: Mobile app for delivery of personalized meal plan for the prevention of AD. This mobile application is designed for guided, proactive and self-executed prevention of AD, and targeted at those who are at elevated risk. We propose developing machine-learning algorithms to create meal plans that employ the modified nutrient ranges (from Aims 1 and 2) for a given AD risk genotype. Users will be able to modify food preference parameters (for example, ?vegetarian?) while maintaining the appropriate nutrient ranges. A key outcome of this project will be a platform that supports population-wide dietary intervention by seamlessly connecting preventive healthcare with daily life in the digital age."
"9253581","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Platelet BioGenesis is developing a microfluidic bioreactor to produce human platelets at clinical scale. Platelets are the 'band-aids' of the bloodstream, responsible for clot formation and blood vessel repair. Low platelet count is a significant consequence of cancer treatment, transplant, and surgery, for which plate- lets are a critical first-line therapy to prevent mortality due to uncontrolled bleeding. Platelets are de- rived exclusively from volunteer donors. Risk of bacterial growth during room temperature storage limits plate- let shelf life to 5 days, 2 of which are expended by bacterial screening, and 1 during transport to hospitals. As a result blood centers typically do not have more than a 1.5-day platelet inventory available for transfu- sion, making platelet unit inventory especially vulnerable to routine depletion[1, 2]. To address this ma- jor unmet need we are developing a platelet bioreactor that reproduces key features of adult bone marrow (physiological microenvironment) to trigger platelet production from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiP- SCs, a replenishable source of progenitor cells which can be stored frozen for years) at clinical/commercial scale. This SBIR CRP Program proposal for Technical Assistance (SB1) outlines a comprehensive intellectual property strategy for Platelet BioGenesis to develop a proprietary, patent protected technology to produce cGMP-compliant human bioreactor-derived platelets at commercial scale for clinical use in 3 specific aims: Aim 1. Understanding the Patent Landscape. We will work with IP counsel to: (1) identify and assess licens- ing various third party patents and patent applications related to megakaryocyte differentiation protocols and the platelet bioreactor, (2) perform further patent searches (landscape and/or freedom to operate) to ensure that we are able to commercialize our technology without infringement, and/or (3) identify any additional third party patents that may be licensed by us to further improve our competitive commercial position. Aim 2. Protecting Proprietary Technology to Enable Commercialization. We will work with IP counsel to identify intellectual property generated by us and will formulate a strategy for protecting such intellectual prop- erty, either by filing patent applications or ensuring that the technology is maintained as a trade secret. Aim 3. IP Agreements. We will work with the IP counsel to: (1) review our non-disclosure agreements, em- ployment or consultant agreements to ensure the ownership and protection of our intellectual property, and (2) negotiate and enter into license agreements with cGMP-compliant hiPSC suppliers for access to relevant cell lines. cGMP-hiPSC line master banks will be maintained and differentiated into megakaryocytes under estab- lished supply agreements using proprietary cell culture protocols."
"9238945","The opioid abuse epidemic has grown rapidly and disproportionately across the US in recent years. Pennsylvania (PA) has been greatly affected by the epidemic; hospitalizations for prescription opioid and heroin overdoses increased by 285 and 315%, respectively, in PA rural counties between 2000 and 2014, compared to 208 and 143% in urban counties. The prevalence of opioid use disorders (OUD) among the Medicaid population has increased in all PA counties except for Philadelphia; however, the health system in rural PA has lacked the capacity to address this need. The typical rural county targeted by this intervention has only one primary care provider who prescribes buprenorphine. The objective of this project is to double the number of primary care physicians delivering high-quality medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in rural PA by implementing and testing a state-led, multi-faceted intervention. Led by the PA Department of Human Services (DHS), the three aims of this project are to 1) Implement solutions to overcoming barriers to implementation of MAT in primary care; 2) Evaluate the effect of the multi-faceted intervention to expand MAT in rural primary care practices on supply of MAT providers and access to high-quality MAT for Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD; and 3) Disseminate findings to state and national stakeholders, and adopt successful program strategies as evidence-based policies in PA Medicaid. Participating practices will be trained to provide MAT consistent with current American Society of Addiction Medicine guidelines. Five intervention components will be available to all primary care practices recruited to participate. 1) An Implementation Team, including MAT and primary care practice management experts, who will assist providers in adding MAT services to their practice; 2) A Training Remote Infusion of MAT program, where practices will remotely join presentations by addiction experts to review complex opioid case studies to improve their own treatment capabilities; 3) A Peer-to-Peer Tele- consultation that participating providers can use to speak with an on-call addiction specialist who will offer insight and expert advice on complex patients and MAT; 4) A Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Health Home hub that will provide care management services for participating practices; and 5) Tele-psychiatry Coordination, where the SUD Health Home care management team will coordinate tele-psychiatry services for patients of participating practices. The intervention will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach including qualitative, survey, and claims-based analyses. Qualitative data from participating physicians and staff will be continually collected. Claims-based measures will include supply, prevalence, utilization, and outcome variables that will be compared to PA counties that did not receive the intervention using interrupted time series and difference-in-difference analyses. Finally, a Medicaid beneficiary patient survey will measure changes in perceived access to and experience with MAT. DHS will disseminate program materials and will implement successful strategies from the project into evidence-based policies."
"9292167","ABSTRACT ? ADMINISTRATIVE CORE The main objective of the Administrative Core (Admin Core) is to serve as a central site to facilitate communication and interaction between the investigators to support collaboration, to the external scientific communities, and to ensure efficient governance and oversight of the Center. Our Center without Walls (the Center) will consist of 5 different sites. The research programs in the Center are highly interactive. The interactions will occur at different levels ranging from the scientific (exchange of information and data, sharing of resources and specialized personnel, co-mentoring of junior investigators) to the administrative (organization of meetings and interactions with national FTD centers). In addition, the goals, research strategies, and use of resources will need to be periodically reevaluated by internal executive committees and external advisors to maximize progress in achieving the aims of the Center. We propose four specific aims. In Aim 1, the Core will help the director oversee Center governance and management, including implementation of strategies to facilitate communication among the various components and maximize the use of internal and external resources. The core will also coordinate communications among the researchers in each project, between projects and the cores, between the Center and the internal Executive Steering Committee and the external Scientific Advisory Committee, and between the Center and the administration of the five sites, NINDS program staff, and the other national centers on FTD. In Aim 2, the core will promote exchanges among the projects and cores and monitor their progress toward the stated goals of the Center, including working with Data core to develop and maintain a web-based project management system, a public website and an intranet for secured data, and organize on-site meetings and teleconferences. The core will develop and maintain a web-based interface to help the director and Steering Committee members maximize the generation and use of resources, both within and external to the Center. The core will ensure that Center activities comply with federal and institutional regulations by providing information on NIH regulations and will provide timely reports and updates on compliance to the Clinical Oversight and Executive Steering Committees. In Aim 3, the core will coordinate external interactions and foster relationships with the broader research and advocacy communities by facilitating interactions with the Tau Consortium (TC), with Gladstone, and the broader scientific community. In Aim 4, the Core will ensure timely preparation of progress reports and the dissemination of research findings and materials, including providing advance notice of manuscripts and publications to the NINDS program officer and work with the NINDS Office of Communications on press releases highlighting Center accomplishments."

Our research group brings together two top-tier research institutes to interactively alter and image cerebral physiology using a novel animal model of ischemic stroke. The use of this model will allow direct visualization of the pial collateral flow, local alteration in cerebral physiology and the hypothesized response to flow augmentation therapy."
"9271737","Abstract Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) primarily enters the host and initiates infection through mucosal tissues. Therefore, a vaccination strategy that can elicit cellular and humoral immune responses in mucosal tissues is urgently needed. However, there is currently no approved adjuvant that can achieve robust levels of both T-cell and antibody responses in mucosal tissues. Therefore, there is a critical need for an alternative, effective, and safe strategy for mucosal vaccination. Our long-range goal is to develop vaccine delivery systems that can elicit protective immunity against HIV-1. Our objective here is to engineer nanoparticles for mucosal delivery of HIV-1 antigens and investigate their impact on elicitation of systemic and mucosal immune responses. To that end, we have developed a new nanoparticle (NP) system that can elicit strong cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) responses with subunit protein antigens. We show that these new vaccine NPs promote antigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells in vivo, generate CTLs that disseminate to mucosal tissues, including cervicovaginal and gastrointestinal tracts, and protect animals against viral infection. We also show that NPs induce significantly higher antibody titers, lasting > 400 days in mice with greater avidity, durability, and breadth, compared with conventional adjuvants on the market (e.g. alum or Montanide). Based on these preliminary data, we propose to develop a new NP-based strategy for mucosal immunization against HIV-1. We will test our central hypothesis that NPs incorporated with T and B-cell HIV-1 immunogens will elicit concerted cellular and humoral immune responses in mucosal tissues. At the completion of the proposed studies, we will have identified a new vaccination technology that can induce mucosal T and B cell responses against HIV-1. These studies will accelerate HIV-1 vaccine development and advance our understanding of the impact of vaccine delivery systems on mucosal immunity."
"9270797","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the United States and has no proven therapy. Critical to the development of an effective treatment for this disease is an understanding of how a benign fatty liver progresses to hepatocellular injury and inflammation or steatohepatitis that leads to chronic liver disease. The objective of this proposal is to delineate mechanisms by which the lysosomal degradative pathway of autophagy plays a central role in preventing the development of steatohepatitis. Our previous investigations identified a novel function for autophagy in the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism and steatosis. Autophagy mediates the lipolytic breakdown of stored lipids into free fatty acids (FFAs) and maintains levels of mitochondrial ?-oxidation, suggesting a central role for autophagy in cellular pathways regulated by lipid metabolism. Preliminary findings demonstrate that autophagy mediates hepatocyte resistance to toxicity from saturated FFAs. In addition we have identified a function for autophagy in down regulating the proinflammatory activation and polarization of macrophages by inflammatory mediators including FFAs. These findings indicate that autophagy functions to regulate both cellular death pathways and innate immunity in response to elevated FFAs which are central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Based on these and other preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that the effects of autophagy on hepatocyte and macrophage lipid metabolism are critical to prevent the development of liver injury and inflammation in hepatic steatosis. We will test this hypothesis by delineating the mechanisms by which autophagy-mediated effects on lipid breakdown regulate hepatocyte injury and death and macrophage activation in studies contained in three Specific Aims. First, we will test the hypothesis that autophagy prevents hepatocyte organelle damage and cell death by promoting the metabolism of saturated FFAs. Second, we will test the hypothesis that autophagy down regulates the innate immune response through effects on lipid metabolism that block proinflammatory macrophage activation and polarization. Third, we will test the hypothesis that decreased autophagy in hepatocytes and macrophages in vivo promotes the development of liver injury and inflammation in the setting of hepatic steatosis. The objective of these studies is to delineate novel paradigms by which the effects of autophagy on lipid metabolism function to block hepatocyte death and development of a proinflammatory state. The findings will indicate that defects in autophagy that occur with obesity and aging may contribute to the development of steatohepatitis. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to better understand the basic cellular mechanisms underlying the development of steatohepatitis in order to design new strategies to prevent and treat human NAFLD."
"9152868","ASPREE-AMD Low-dose aspirin and age-related macular degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age?related macular degeneration (AMD) has a devastating effect on vision, predominantly at the age of 70 years or older. Its pathogenesis at the early stages involves a low-grade inflammatory process within the retina, and the late stages are associated with retinal haemorrhages and atrophy. In this age group, one of the most common medications prescribed is aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular events. As aspirin has both anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties, it has the potential to influence the course of AMD. Whilst it could reduce the inflammatory component at earlier stages of AMD, it is also plausible that it could provoke haemorrhaging and exacerbate the course of the disease at its more advanced stage. The proposed study aims to evaluate risk to benefit ratios of the effect of aspirin on the course of AMD in the clinical trial on over 5000 participants. It is a collaborative (Monash University and Centre for Eye Research Australia) five-year follow up study, which capitalizes on the resources of the ongoing NIH-funded randomized controlled clinical trial ASPREE (ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly). The ASPREE parent study has a strong cohort of people over the age of 70 with extensive study parameters, which ancillary studies can access. The ASPREE-AMD sub-study is based on the assessment of the AMD status of the colour retinal images collected with high resolution non-mydriatic Canon retinal cameras ?on wheels? at baseline, 3 years, and 5 years after randomization. All images are graded for AMD by experienced retinal graders. This project involves eye imaging in mobile units at multiple metropolitan, regional, and rural areas of Australia. Additionally, the information on the use of medications for AMD treatment will be obtained from MEDICARE. This study has a unique combination of randomised controlled design, large sample size, sufficient length, cost-effectiveness, wide community involvement, and a focus on the age group when AMD manifests (70+). These factors assure high generalisability. Its feasibility has been proven, its infrastructure developed, all required equipment is in place and its staff are trained and experienced. This study is accordant with the NIH?s mission to seek new knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness by prevention of human diseases. AMD prevention is a research priority at both collaborating institutions: Monash University (Department of Preventive Medicine) and the Centre for Eye Research Australia (Macular Research Unit). The completion of the 5-year follow up ASPREE-AMD study may significantly advance current knowledge and provide definitive information on the effect of aspirin either as a primary prevention or as a potential risk factor for AMD progression."
"9228248","Project Summary Preventing and reducing the risk for youth violence remains a significant challenge for communities across the country. Researchers have consistently called for a coordinated, comprehensive public health response to youth violence, but our nation lacks the prevention infrastructure to put this approach into place ? particularly in high-burden urban communities. This project is designed to provide a replicable roadmap for building this infrastructure at the community-level. The Denver Youth Violence Prevention Center (DYVPC) builds from the efforts of our current YVPC, Montbello?s Steps to Success project, which focuses on evaluating a data-driven multi-faceted approach to youth violence prevention. We bring together a multidisciplinary team of researchers, practitioners, and community partners to implement and evaluate a prevention system that delivers community- and policy-level youth violence prevention strategies matched to local need in two high-burden Denver communities. DYVPC activities include: (1) working in collaboration with community partners in two high- burden Denver communities with different levels of readiness to implement Communities That Care (CTC) ? an evidence-based, community-level prevention system that provides a data-driven framework for community decision-making. For this project, CTC will focus on the selection and implementation of community-level prevention strategies and policies that best address community needs, values, and resources; (2) enacting a policy change in violence screening through routine health care settings to identify high-risk youth and match them to evidence-based interventions; (3) conducting an implementation process evaluation to measure community readiness and capacity to build a local prevention infrastructure and monitor implementation fidelity of the community-level prevention system; (4) using multiple quasi-experimental designs to evaluate changes in (a) neighborhood social processes and characteristics that may be influenced by the community-level prevention system and selected community- and policy-level prevention strategies and (b) rates of youth violence; (5) developing an implementation roadmap for future replication and scalability both locally and nationally. The sites participating in this study are two high-burden Denver residential neighborhoods, Montbello and Northeast Park Hill, with rates of violent activity and violent behaviors that are significantly greater than the national average. This study will enhance the body of research that focuses on effective community- and policy-level prevention strategies, contribute to understanding the relationship between community readiness/capacity and prevention strategy implementation outcomes, and examine how effective community-level strategies impact neighborhood social processes and conditions. Additionally, this project has the potential to advance understanding of community-level violence prevention efforts through cross-Center collaboration with the Chicago Center for Youth Violence Prevention. The comparability with Chicago will permit examination of the generalizability of the overall project findings to other communities."
"9235875","Gastroparesis (GP) in children and adults is characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. GP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality yet little is known regarding its incidence, prevalence, and natural history, particularly in children. This knowledge gap in pediatric GP is exacerbated by lack of both normative data for gastric emptying and a GP specific patient reported outcome measure. The limited data suggest significant differences between clinical symptoms of GP in children vs adults. Thus, even the limited data regarding GP in adults are unlikely to provide insight and fill the knowledge gaps regarding GP in children. These issues (among others) underscore the need for childhood GP specific research strategies rather than translation of adult based GP knowledge to this very different population.  To begin to identify effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies leading to improved outcomes for children with GP given the vast knowledge gaps in the field, we propose the following Specific Aims within a prospective, multiinstitutional collaboration:  1) Using the 13C-Spirulina breath test (BT) (which correlates well with gastric scintigraphy) define normal values for solid meal emptying in (n=260) healthy controls (HC) (5-18 yrs. of age). Sub-Aim: carry out the BT in children (n=420, 5-18 yrs. of age) with presumed GP who are undergoing gastric scintigraphy to identify children who truly have GP as defined by the normal values obtained in HC.  2) In children undergoing gastric scintigraphy in (Sub) Aim 1, determine the feasibility, reliability, and validity of generic and gastrointestinal (GI)-specific health-related quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scales and PedsQL GI Symptoms Scales and PedsQL GI Worry Scales. Sub- Aim 2A: Use the scales to differentiate patients with GP vs. age, gender, and race/ethnicity matched children with functional dyspepsia (whose symptoms often overlap with GP) and HC; Sub-Aim 2B: Use the GI scales and cognitive interviews to create a pediatric GP-specific health-related quality of life measure.  3) Create a national prospective: (a) Registry of children and adolescents with GP to include demographic, clinical, psychological, and nutritional characteristics and (b) Biorepository of serum, GI mucosal biopsies (in those undergoing upper GI endoscopy), and stool for future analyses such as DNA, cytokines, microbiome.  This multidisciplinary approach is innovative as it will, for the first time, prospectively begin to fill the vast knowledge void regarding GP in children. These data will be an important step toward targeted and pediatric- friendly interventions for children with GP. This project also will be a first step to developing a national pediatric consortium to investigate GP in children. The current proposal fits RFA-DK-16-010 to, among other goals, better understand the epidemiology of GP, define the GP/FD spectrum, explore and design new patient reported outcomes, and the role of the human microbiome on disease expression."
"9261342","The Development of Targeted Therapies for Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders: Current and future prospects conference will provide a forum for multidisciplinary investigators to discuss emerging therapeutic opportunities for peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs). Our overarching goal is to develop a roadmap for PBD therapeutic development based on the discussions that originate from and extend beyond this conference. PBDs are a disease spectrum that impacts the functions of multiple organ systems, with the most profound effects on the central nervous system, and leads to a shortened life span. In addition to the neurological aspects of disease, patients most typically manifest a progressive loss of vision and hearing as well as respiratory, hepatic, renal, and skeletal abnormalities. The therapeutic roadmap generated as a result of this conference will be used by clinically-oriented colleagues and relevant disease foundations, the Global Foundation for Peroxisomal Disorders (GFPD) and RhizoKids International, to plan for future translational research initiatives. The audience will be comprised of a diverse community of individuals with complementary areas of expertise including physician-scientists who treat patients with PBDs, translational researchers, basic scientists, and patient advocates, all of whom share an interest in therapeutic initiatives for rare diseases, including PBDs. Special emphasis will be placed on the participation of junior investigators and trainees, with the expectation that they will provide novel ideas and perspectives and also benefit from interacting with the community-based therapeutic planning efforts at the conference. Participants from underrepresented communities in the neurosciences and general medical sciences will provide important perspectives and be involved in critical discussions about patient recruitment and access to newly developed treatments. The diverse scientific community and patient advocates participating at this conference will allow for a cross-fertilization of ideas relevant to translational research that may not be achievable in more general meetings, such as those of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) and the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG)."

"9205923","Hypertension is the number one cause of racial group disparities in mortality in the U.S. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which race is linked with the cardiovascular system is key. African Americans (AA) are exposed to more stress across the lifespan and lifetime adversity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CHD) and hypertension. However, mechanisms accounting for the links between long-term stress exposure, hypertension and CHD remain unclear. Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to be a major contender as it predicts increased risk of cardiac events and mortality, especially among people with hypertension. According to existing theories of racial health disparities, stress, and social relations, racial health disparities are due to variations in long-term exposure to stress and stress reactivity (biological, psychological, behavioral) and those race differences are moderated by social relations and age. In response to the FOA Aging Research on Stress and Resilience to Address Health Disparities in the United States (RFA-AG-16-022), the present study seeks to understand how long-term stress exposure links with stress reactivity among AA and EA adults. This study capitalizes the existing longitudinal Social Relations and Health Study (SRS),a regionally representative panel sample of AA and EA individuals from the Detroit metropolitan area who began participating in 1992 (ages 13 to 93) and completed the third wave in 2015 (ages 30 to 95). The proposed study will incorporates two new studies of short-term stress reactivity: 1) a daily stress study and 2) a laboratory stress study. The daily stress study will target 300 participants (50% AA; 50%EA) and will incorporate a 4 day experience sampling study of self-reported stress exposure and reactivity (psychological, behavioral) as well as two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess biological reactivity: 1) a newly developed non-invasive continuous monitoring ring device that provides estimates of vascular resistance and 2) a watch that assesses heart rate, heart rate variability, and galvanic skin response. In the laboratory study we will examine reactivity to standard laboratory stressors among a sample of 50 AA and 50 EA respondents who completed the daily stress study to examine more thoroughly their physiological responses to stress with the same ambulatory ring and watch as well as established continuous monitors. The proposed research addresses three aims: 1) Test links between long- term stress exposure and short-term stress reactivity among EA and AA adults, 2) Examine age differences in long-term stress exposure and short-term reactivity by race, and 3) Determine how long-term social relationships moderate individual differences in stress exposure and reactivity. This project has public health significance as it will identify individuals who are more reactive to stress and the immediate as well as lifespan factors that are associated with greater stress reactivity. A more nuanced understanding of the psychological and biological implications of stress among diverse populations will lead to the development and testing of interventions for reducing stress, later health problems, and health disparities."
"9000517","CORE-018: PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Protocol Review and Monitoring System [PRMS] of the OSUCCC consists of a Clinical Scientific Review  Committee [CSRC] that reviews all new cancer-related clinical protocols for scientific merit prior to IRB  submission and monitors the scientific progress of ongoing studies including accrual rates. The main CSRC is  organized into two teams (with highly similar composition) that collectively meet twice monthly (each once per  month), facilitating rapid protocol review. The CSRC consists of 37 members representative of all the  OSUCCC research programs and includes clinical and basic researchers, biostatisticians, pharmacists, and  research nurses. Additionally, members with specific expertise in the areas of cancer prevention and control as  well as pediatrics are convened as CSRC sub-committees to provide focused review of these protocols. At its  twice monthly meetings, the main CSRC performs full scientific reviews of all cancer-related clinical protocols  initiated by local investigators or pharmaceutical industry sponsors and acknowledges NIH peer-reviewed  studies. Each CSRC member is expected to be present at each scheduled meeting, and a majority of the  voting members scheduled to be at a meeting must be present to attain a quorum for the meeting. Failure to  achieve a quorum at a meeting precludes any business being conducted. In addition to achieving quorum,  appropriate reviewer expertise must be present in order for business to be conducted. CSRC approval of a  protocol is required prior to its review by the OSU Cancer Institutional Review Board. Each protocol is reviewed  by four CSRC members (a primary reviewer, a secondary reviewer, a biostatistician, and a pharmacist).  Reviewers follow a written review template that calls for an analysis of the scientific hypothesis and rationale,  experimental design, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment plan, statistical plan, pharmacy  considerations and proper prioritization. As of January 2009, all new research protocols undergo concurrent  review by the CSRC Logistics Review Committee (LRC), which is a sub-committee of the CSRC. The LRC was  implemented to facilitate trial activation and confirm proper research prioritization. The LRC does not evaluate  the scientific aspects of the protocol, but does evaluate the availability of the resources necessary to  successfully implement and complete the research protocol. The CSRC Executive Committee (EC) provides  oversight to the CSRC. It is led by the CSRC Chair. The EC consists of eight CSRC members that meet  monthly to review protocol accrual and scientific progress and ensure that protocol prioritization rules are  followed. The CSRC EC is responsible for communication with investigators whose clincial trials are not  meeting their accrual goals and providing support to facilitate accrual. The CSRC adheres to a set of well-  defined criteria for accrual monitoring and trial prioritization. Those ongoing studies that do not show adequate  accrual or fail to meet accepted standards of quality control based on formal audits are terminated. In 2014, the  CSRC closed 18 trials for low accrual. The EC also performs expedited reviews for appropriate studies (e.g.,  retrospective studies). In the last year (12/1/13 to 11/30/14), 199 new protocols were reviewed by the CSRC  with the following dispositions: 68 (34%) were approved as written, 55 (28%) were approved with stipulations,  14 (7%) were deferred, 57 (29%) were administratively acknowledged after having undergone previous NIH  peer-review, and 5 (2%) were disapproved. Twenty-eight non-interventional protocols were also  administratively approved by the CSRC EC."
"9244589","Project Summary/Abstract Rates of dementia diagnoses and personal experience with dementia are staggering. Dementia?s impact is wide ranging, affecting the lives of those diagnosed as well as their caregivers, friends, and family. Therefore, people may worry about the possibility of developing dementia well before they do (if they ever do). Indeed, almost one third of an adult population surveyed identified dementia as their most feared disease, second only to cancer (MetLife, 2011). The proposed research will focus on dementia worry ? the anxiety about dementia prior to symptoms or diagnosis. Because dementia worry can exist in persons of varying age and cognitive status, it is important to investigate this phenomenon among middle-aged and older adults. In spite of the prevalence of Alzheimer?s disease and related disorders (ADRD), understanding of dementia, its causes, and symptoms remains low. Increasing awareness of ADRD combined with minimal understanding of ADRD is believed to pose a potent threat to adults of all ages, particularly middle-aged and older individuals. People with high dementia worry are believed to view ADRD as threatening due to the high perceived negativity of dementia, high perceived risk of ADRD, and low perceived control or means for prevention. There is currently little research concerning the impact of dementia worry on daily life, psychological functioning, and future planning. Using experimental methods, the proposed research will induce different levels of dementia worry experimentally (based on commonly encountered environmental cues such as ageist stereotypes, prevalence statistics, and dementia awareness campaigns) to assess some potential psychological and health-related consequences of dementia worry. Finally, we will investigate ways to reduce dementia worry, taking the initial steps in developing and assessing the immediate and short-term impact of interventions, with our final study including a three month follow-up to determine if beneficial effects may last. Consistent with NIH?s mission to increase understanding of mental disorders and NIA?s mission to support research designed to improve the health and well-being of older adults, the proposed studies will increase understanding of dementia worry, its impact on functioning and psychological well-being, with the goal of identifying pragmatic interventions to reduce dementia worry and improve well-being."
"9072009","SUMMARY  The purpose of the Lipidomics Core in the PPG is to provide intellectual and physical resources (particularly  state-of-the-art mass spectrometry analysis of sphingolipids and synthetic molecular tools) to enhance  understanding of the role of bioactive lipids in cancer biology with the goal to discover future therapeutics. The  diversity of bioactive lipids and their interconnected metabolism generates a network of pathways regulating  intra- and inter-cellular signaling and function. Dysfunctions in these pathways contribute to the pathobiology of  cancer progression and metastasis. These considerations have necessitated the development of lipid  chemistry and analysis. The Lipidomics Core was created based on unique expertise of the key personnel in  lipid chemistry, analysis, and metabolism. This Core has developed into an institutional, national, and  international resource in the emerging fields of lipidomics and lipid chemical biology. Core services include: 1)  Providing qualitative and quantitative analysis of lipid components from different biological materials (cells,  tissue, and biological fluids), primarily employing high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) technology?the Core currently provides quantitative analysis of more than 300  distinct lipid molecular species at a basic metabolomic level; 2) Developing and providing synthetic molecular  tools to study lipid metabolism (e.g., functionalized and fluorescent ceramides, site-specific radioactive  sphingolipids, 17C-sphingolipids) and diversified synthetic lipids and analogs for cellular, in vitro, and in vivo  studies (e.g., organelle-targeted sphingolipids and organelle-targeted inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolizing  enzymes); 3) Providing direct MALDI-MS tissue analysis to visualize the distribution of lipid based anti-cancer  drugs and their molecular effects on sphingolipid components; and 4) Assisting PPG investigators in  experimental design, selection of lipids of interest, and interpretation of analytical results."
"9144768","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with heart failure experience four million hospitalizations per year in the United States. Of these hospitalizations, approximately three-quarters, or three million hospitalizations annually, are for causes other than heart failure. Patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes are at high risk of post- discharge mortality possibly in part because they are less likely to receive guideline recommended care than patients who are hospitalized primarily for heart failure. Health information technology (HIT) has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing clinician compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Specifically, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve care for patients in hospitals, including those hospitalized for heart failure. Despite their utility, CDSSs have not been developed to apply more broadly to patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. This is clearly a gap for the millions of patients with heart failure who might experience improved outcomes if they were to receive guideline recommended care. The purpose of this study is to develop and test a CDSS for hospitalized patients who have heart failure, regardless of reason for hospitalization. The firt aim is to develop an Electronic Health Record (EHR) based algorithm to identify patients with heart failure using a variety of computational techniques including natural language processing. The second aim is to develop a CDSS to support delivery of guideline recommended care to hospitalized patients with heart failure using human computer interaction techniques. The third aim is to implement and test the effectiveness of the CDSS on processes of care for patients with heart failure who are hospitalized for other causes. The central hypothesis is that this decision support system will increase adherence to guideline recommended care, ideally improving outcomes as a result. The candidate, Saul Blecker, MD, MHS, is a general internist and clinician investigator at NYU School of Medicine. The candidate proposes a program of career development and training to achieve the following objectives: 1) develop expertise in medical informatics; 2) gain skills in human computer interaction; 3) develop expertise in implementation research. The candidate's primary mentor, Stuart Katz, MD, MS, is a seasoned mentor and researcher in heart failure. His co-mentor is Gilad Kuperman, MD, PhD, a leader in health information technology and medical informatics. Donna Shelley, MD, MPH, an expert in implementation and effectiveness research, will serve as an additional co-mentor. This mentorship team will work closely together to guide Dr. Blecker toward his research goal of leveraging HIT to improve the quality care for patients with heart failure."
"9151891","PROJECT SUMMARY We have recently identified homozygous loss of function mutations in the complement regulatory protein CD55 in two unrelated individuals suffering from early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Mouse models have previously shown that CD55 deficiency leads to hyper activation of T cells in response to antigen and the enhanced secretion of inflammatory cytokines associated with development of more severe EAE and DSS induced colitis than wild type counter parts. This would suggest that the signaling pathways, either related to CD55's complement regulatory activity or its ability to function as a costimulatory molecule, leading to disease in CD55 deficient individuals are conserved across species and represent very promising therapeutic targets. Importantly, our preliminary data show a lack of CD55 on patient T cells is associated with a drastic upregulation of cytokine production including those traditionally associated with Th1 and Th2 responses. Based on the literature and on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that CD55 is critical for proper regulation of local complement activation and that its absence leads to complement mediated immune dysfunction and failure of epithelial barriers. This hypothesis will be tested by carrying out the following three specific aims designed to determine the cause of disease, and test the modulation of this pathway as a potential therapeutic intervention in IBD. In Aim 1 we will determine the role of CD55 in T cell activation, differentiation, and cytokine production through use of CD55 deficient and healthy normal donor cells and specific complement inhibitors including small molecule and blocking antibodies. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the role of CD55 in maintaining gut epithelial barrier integrity and promoting intestinal restitution and wound repair. Finally, in Aim 3 we will investigate the role of complement and CD55 in mouse models of IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets. Together these studies will provide mechanistic insight into the function of CD55 in immune cell and epithelial cell activation and homeostasis. Additionally, this work will evaluate the use of complement modulating therapies for the treatment of IBD in our patient population and in otherwise healthy individuals. Additionally, the activities planned under this award will provide an essential training opportunity that will position the applicant for success as an independent researcher at an academic institution studying the mechanisms of T cell signaling and activation during the immune response."
"9147585","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress has repeatedly been acknowledged as a contributing factor to adverse events in team-based settings and is widely recognized as a critical factor affecting performance in aviation, the military, professional sports, and medicine. Specifically, if people experience acute stress, the way they think and how they interact may become disrupted. In this study, we will show learners how their performance is affected by acute stress. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, patterns of effective acute stress management will be developed for trauma resuscitation, a time-sensitive and high stress clinical environment. Simulations will be conducted with resuscitation teams, and performance will be assessed through real-time behavior and physiological measures. Teams will be shown their performance assessments, and will be taught to adjust their performance to better manage acute stress. As a result, teams can recover more quickly and manage their acute stress more effectively. This project will result in improved stress management during trauma resuscitation, providing essential knowledge for trauma teams but with generalizability to other medical settings."
"9026804","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal homeostasis represents the sum of many immunoregulatory activities, based in both innate and adaptive immunity. This application is structured around concepts describing regulation of the presence and activity of innate immune cells in tissues; the niches in which the immune cells reside after entry into tissues; and the vascular endothelial cells that mediate the passage of cells from the circulation into the tissue. Many tissues, including retina and brain, use combinations of chemokines and chemokine receptors, especially CCL2/CCR2 and CX3CL1/CX3CR1, to facilitate entry of innate immune cells across the endothelium into the tissue. Immune cells live in, and are recruited to, niches in  tissues where chemokines and cytokines maintain their presence and activity. These concepts, combined with published and preliminary results, suggested a three niche model for retina. A major retinal niche (N1) is filled by the initial seeding of the retina with microglia (MG) during retinal development. In resting retina, this population far exceeds the number of other immune cells in niche 2 (N2). We find recruited mononuclear cells in the retina of mice that express a GFP reporter in N2 using transgenic CD11c-DTR/GFP mice (CDG mice). Since they have antigen presenting function for naive, antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, we often describe them as dendritic cells (DC). Upon stimulation of the retina, whether by injury, stress or immune response, recruited cells represented by the GFP+ cells occupy N2, which can grow substantially, reaching numbers equivalent to the microglia in N1. Recent reports suggest the presence of resident progenitor cells in CNS that sustain the MG; we have designated the progenitor niche as N3. These niches have some overlap, morphologically and phenotypically, but they are distinct in some respects. For example, as an acute challenge subsides, the recruited cells in N2 are mostly lost from the retina, but the microglia in N1 largely persist. Uncertainty arises in chronic challenges to the retina, since there appears to be some replacement of MG with recruited cells, perhaps occupying N3. Casting the resident and transient occupants in a model in which they occupy different niches facilitates the formulation of questions about these cells. We propose to explore the following: 1) Can cells from N2 physically and/or functionally replace MG in N1; if so, what are the consequences for retinal health? 2) How do recruited cells get into N2; what controls their access, and how are the cells in N1 and N2 maintained in their respective niches? 3) Can the MG progenitor niche (N3) be filled with new progenitors in adult mice; will they yield fully functional MG?like cells?"
"9173419","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This project will result in the deployment of a fully implanted myoelectric signal (MES) acquisition system in 3 veterans that is used to control advanced dexterous prosthetic hands and wrists for individuals with transradial (below elbow) amputations. A novel MES controller algorithm based on a time-delayed neural network and a probabilistic adaptive filter that selectively suppresses unintended movement commands will allow simultaneous and continuous control of the multiple motions provided by the advanced prosthesis. The implanted MES acquisition system will use a new family of devices that include an implanted battery, implanted amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters, and an implanted telemetry system. This implanted MES acquisition system will provide highly selective and highly repeatable MES recordings from any remaining muscle in the limb, even those located deep within the limb or not located directly underneath the socket. The implanted intramuscular electrodes can be sized for any muscle, will be firmly anchored within the muscles, and do not require any donning by the user. The implanted MES acquisition system will communicate wirelessly with a small external hub that is mounted inconspicuously on the prosthetic limb using the industry standard MedRadio protocol. The external hub receives the MES signals, implements the new MES controller algorithm, and then interfaces with the control bus of the prosthesis to command its various joint motions.  The controller algorithm will be initially developed using temporary fine-wire EMG electrode recordings and a virtual prosthesis simulator in which 10 amputee participants will perform simulated functional tasks. The muscle signals used in these experiments will be varied to determine which muscles provide the best MES signals for control, how many muscles will be needed in the final system, and to estimate the expected performance of the final system. In parallel, the external hub will be realized using a small commercial device with built-in MedRadio telemetry and a microcontroller for implementing the advanced controller algorithm, and regulatory approvals (Investigational Device Exemption from the Food and Drug Administration and local Institutional Review Board) will be obtained. The permanent system (implanted MES system, external hub with advanced control algorithm, dexterous commercial upper limb myoelectric prosthesis) will then be integrated and realized in 3 individuals with transradial amputations. Extensive technical assessments will demonstrate the performance of the system components. An extensive battery of clinical assessments will compare the functional performance of the user's standard of care prosthesis control system (typically surface EMG-based recordings with a state controller) to that of the new implanted MES - advanced controller algorithm approach developed under this project.  The proposed work is directly aligned with the strategic plan of the VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Service and is an excellent complement to the recent development of sophisticated and dexterous upper limb prostheses by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and by several commercial prosthesis manufacturers. The proposed fully-implanted MES acquisition system and advanced controller algorithm will provide the much richer command information needed to realize the potential of these advanced upper limb prostheses. Although initially targeted to individuals with transradial amputations, this same basic approach (i.e., implanted MES with advanced controller) is broadly applicable to other veteran amputee populations in the future, including transhumeral, partial hand, shoulder disarticulation, and lower extremity amputees. Targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), another advanced prosthesis control approach, could also be greatly enhanced by the use of the techniques proposed here. The proposed system thus has the potential to truly revolutionize the way that prosthetists and prosthesis users think about myoelectric control!"
"9189031","Research has shown that Veterans experience better clinical outcomes and are more consistently engaged in mental health treatment when their families are involved in their mental health care. While recent changes in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policy place greater emphasis on family involvement in Veterans' mental health care, rates of family psychotherapy provision remain low (under four percent) and have not increased as a proportion of total mental health care service use. More troubling, rates of family psychotherapy for female Veterans are declining as a proportion of service use, despite preliminary evidence that women may benefit most from family involvement. The proposed project will identify patterns of behaviors within marital and cohabitating partnerships that support Veterans' recovery from PTSD and successful family reintegration post-deployment, paying particular attention to gender differences in these associations. Further understanding of the basic processes within partnerships that facilitate or hinder Veterans' reintegration will help providers more effectively engage families in Veterans' mental health care.  The proposed mentored career development award (CDA-1) application details a two-year plan that will provide training to advance candidate Dr. Holly Laws toward a career as an independent researcher at the VA. The project aims to identify patterns of behavior within marital and cohabiting partnerships that are related to male and female Veterans' recovery from PTSD and successful family reintegration as they separate from military service. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Laws will leverage her expertise in dyadic (or two-person) multilevel data analysis and will integrate training in three new areas: 1) VA family research and psychotherapy initiatives, 2) gender differences in Veterans' experiences, and 3) PTSD course, treatment, and evaluation. Mentors expert in these areas will guide Dr. Laws' training activities, provide project mentorship, and support her professional development as an early career VA family researcher.  Research that includes both Veterans and their partners is only beginning to be conducted regularly, with a majority of prior research relying on Veterans' self-reports of their relationships and well-being. This means that VA clinicians have a mandate to include Veterans' families members (most often spouses or partners) in their mental health care, with only limited research indicating how partners' unique characteristics and perspectives can help Veterans' mental health treatment. Further, there are no published studies that compare the partnerships of female Veterans to those of male Veterans.  The proposed study aims to address these two gaps in the current research on Veteran couples by examining how relationship qualities such as distress, trauma disclosure, and conflict relate to PTSD symptoms and family reintegration in Veterans after discharge from military service. The specific contributions of this project are twofold. First, it will differentiate partnership processes as reported by Veterans from those reported by their partners. By disentangling these perspectives, findings can be used to inform Veteran- and partner-specific intervention and engagement strategies in couples' psychotherapy. Second, this project will identify gender differences in how relationship qualities relate to male Veterans' versus female Veterans' well- being. Results from the proposed work will inform a CDA-2 proposal to apply these findings in the development of an evaluation and screening tool that incorporates gender-specific information to meet the differential family engagement needs of male versus female Veterans. A more fine-grained understanding of how processes within partnership relate to the well-being of male and female Veterans could inform targeted psychosocial interventions to change maladaptive patterns within partnerships, or to reinforce those associated with Veterans' improved well-being.  "
"9238543","Summary The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for action selection and instrumental learning. Maladaptive learning in the BG circuits are known to result in behavior that persist despite harmful and aversive consequences. To understand the compulsive nature of such actions and their tendency for relapse, it is critical to elucidate the circuit mechanisms for the acquisition, reinforcement, and automatization of learned actions. Recent results from our lab showed that the BG are not used to select actions in an all-or-none fashion, as traditionally believed, but are necessary for the continuous generation of movement kinematics in voluntary behavior. These results suggest a new conceptual framework for understanding instrumental learning, allowing continuous quantification of performance as learning occurs and the effect of reinforcement. This proposal aims to determine the role of the BG in instrumental learning by combining wireless in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, 3D motion capture, and behavioral assays from the instrumental conditioning paradigm in freely moving mice. We will quantify continuous neural and behavioral dynamics during instrumental learning, habit formation, extinction, and reinstatement. We will also examine the contributions of the dopaminergic reinforcement signal. The proposed studies will elucidate how specific outcome and contingency representations can recruit instrumental action controllers in the BG. We will manipulate and record from specific BG circuits during initial instrumental learning and habit formation. Results from proposed studies will not only shed light on instrumental learning and reinforcement, but also lead to quantitative characterization of traditional categories such as goal-directed actions and stimulus-driven habits. They have important implications for our understanding of addiction, which involve maladaptive learning in the same neural circuits."
"9013953","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults face a range of medical decisions. Effective decision-making requires access to reliable information and the coordination of cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and reasoning. Age-related declines in health-related decision-making processes have been observed and attributed to insufficient familiarity with health-related information and declines in cognition. The Internet has the potential to meet older adults' needs for a diverse range of health information. Yet, age-related declines in cognitive abilities and a lack of age-appropriate training make it challenging for older adults to take full advantage of the technology. Thus, there is a dire need for interventions that can 1) improve older adults' ability to obtain and evaluate online health information, and 2) strengthen cognitive processes that are key to daily health-related behaviors (e.g., information seeking for informed health decision-making). To address this need, the proposed study will develop and evaluate a 3-month intervention designed to teach older adults how to obtain and evaluate online health information and improve cognitive function. This intervention represents a theoretically motivated extension of our team's pilot research on computer training to teach older adults how to find reliable health information on the Internet. The proposed intervention incorporates three key principles: 1) collaborative learning, 2) a range of activities that depend on a combination of cognitive processes, and 3) real world problem solving. The intervention will be evaluated via a randomized controlled trial with a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed factorial design, with degree of engagement in a collaborative learning program (high engagement; low engagement) and cognitive training (present; absent) as the between-subjects variables and time of measurement (pre; post;) as the within-subjects variable. The proposed study has the following specific aims: Aim 1: To develop training curricula (problem sets and activities that are relevant to older adults' everyday life decisions regarding health) collaboratively with and among older adults to promote older adults' ability to obtain and evaluate online health information. Aim 2: To  determine if the combination of high engagement in collaborative learning plus cognitive training yields larger or broader improvements in older adults' ability to obtain and evaluate online health  information, cognitive performance (attention, working memory, reasoning, retrospective memory and prospective memory), and health decision-making from pre- to post-intervention than either alone. Aim 3: To determine if there are independent effects of the degree of engagement (high engagement; low engagement) in a collaborative learning program and/or cognitive training (presence; absence) on these outcomes from pre- to post-intervention."

"9340851","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During normal aging in the rhesus monkey, pyramidal cells in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) undergo significant structural and functional changes that are likely associated with cognitive impairment, while pyramidal cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) are comparatively spared. The overall hypothesis of this project is that selective vulnerability of neurons and associated networks in LPFC compared to V1 during aging is due to a greater susceptibility to increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction in LPFC than in V1. We further hypothesize that intervention with the potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory polyphenol curcumin will prevent or reduce age-related dysfunction on multiple scales- from the molecular to the behavioral level. This project has three aims: 1) To assess the biomarker and ultrastructural characteristics of V1 and dlPFC neuropil. In situ immunofluorescence multiplexing of ~30 protein biomarkers will be used to determine the molecular phenotype of neurons, glia, vascualture and surrounding neuropil with a GE Global Research MultiOmyxTM platform tailored for use in brain tissue, enabling quantitative, multimarker analyses with high throughput. Using 2D and 3D electron microscopy, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, mitochondria, myelin and axons of neurons as well as microglia and vascular elements will be quantitatively characterized. 2) To characterize the physiological and morphological properties of layer 3 (L3) pyramidal neurons in V1 and dlPFC across the adult lifespan of rhesus monkeys. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings we will assess passive membrane properties, AP firing patterns and underlying ionic currents, as well as excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents of L3 pyramidal cells in in vitro slices of PFC and V1. We will then characterize the morphological properties (e.g. dendritic topology, density and detailed morphology of dendritic spines and neurotransmitter receptor and transporter distribution, as well as oxidative stress markers) of these same pyramidal cells using immunohistochemistry and ultra-high resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy. 3) To use computational models of V1 and dlPFC networks and spatial working memory task behavior to make predictions about the functional consequences -at the single neuron, network and behavioral levels- of changes revealed in Aims 1 and 2. Unique to this proposal is the combination of state-of-the art physiological, anatomical and computational approaches together with concurrent behavioral assessment of the aging monkey under control conditions and following therapeutic treatment with curcumin. This project will yield entirely novel and critically needed information on the neural substrates of cognitive decline in the aging primate and provide important insight into the specific mechanisms of action of protective anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidants during normal aging."
"9245839","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal is for a five-year renewal of a T90/R90 training program in Computational Neuroscience at Brandeis University. The proposed program requests funding to support 6 undergraduates, 4 NRSA eligible graduate students, and 2 non- NRSA eligible graduate students each year. Our goal is to identify early career students and provide them the formal and informal education and training they will need to develop into the next generation of computational/quantitative neuroscientists. This is particularly important in the upcoming era of ?Big Data? as the techniques needed to collect and analyze neuroscience data are becoming increasingly rigorous and quantitative. The long-term goals and objectives are to increase the number of scientists with strong quantitative and modeling skills in neuroscience, as this cohort will be needed to understand brain function in health and disease. The 21 training faculty have research expertise from human cognition to cellular and molecular neuroscience, so a wide range of research problems, at numerous levels of analysis are available to trainees. The training faculty were chosen because they have demonstrated commitment to the use of theoretical and computational methods and interdisciplinary collaboration to understand the nervous system in health and disease. Students will take courses in statistics, data analysis, computational neuroscience, obtain skills in building models of neurons, synapses, and networks, and employ these in a variety of independent research projects. Two cohorts of prospective trainees will be targeted: 1) Individuals with strong prior experience with quantitative methods who wish to work in neuroscience. 2) Individuals in coming from psychology, neuroscience and biology who wish to learn to employ quantitative and computational methods as part of their ability to tackle important problems in neuroscience. In addition to course work and laboratory research, students and trainees will be engaged in a large number of other activities designed to enhance their speaking skills, writing skills, and ability to collaborate with other scientists. All students and trainees will receive training in the responsible conduct of science, and will interact with senior scientists at other institutions. Trainees from underrepresented populations will be included."
"9268902","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible airways obstruction and nonspecific airways hyperresponsiveness to inhaled bronchoconstrictors. The ability of anticholinergics to approximate the bronchodilatation achieved by direct acting smooth muscle relaxants and to reduce airways reactivity implicates airway parasympathetic cholinergic nerves as key regulators of asthma pathophysiology. The muscarinic receptor antagonists such as ipratropium and tiotropium are poorly tolerated upon systemic administration and thus require topical application to the airways by aerosol. Limiting the effectiveness of this mode of delivery is the fact that the drugs will work only in those airways accessible to topically-applied therapeutics. Mucus plugging, turbulent, limited and/ or uneven airflow distribution limits drug aerosol access to the distal airways. Anticholinergics also provide little or no relief from chronic cough or dyspnea, symptoms of obstructive lung diseases that contribute adversely to patient quality of life. We hypothesize that a therapeutic strategy that could selectively and reversibly targets as needed all afferent and efferent nerve conduction to and from the airways will provide superior control of asthma symptoms when compared to currently used anticholinergic agents and direct acting bronchodilators. We have been developing peripheral neuromodulation approaches for the treatment of obstructive lung diseases. The vagal neuromodulation techniques achieve peak reversal of baseline cholinergic tone that approximates the effects of topically applied anticholinergics, but with maximal effects attained in only a fraction of the time required by the muscarinic receptor antagonists, can target all nerves projecting to the intrapulmonary airways without the constraints of topical delivery, (e.g. superior to anticholinergics in modulating peripheral airway caliber), can be delivered repeatedly as needed, and if combined with a smart technology, such neuromodulators could provide chronic symptom control in patients with obstructive lung diseases. We will use Synapse device by Nuviant, an FDA approved electrode interface used in patients with chronic pain, to generate preclinical proof of concept data in a well-characterized canine model of obstructive lung diseases. We will incorporate high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), a technique optimized for lung studies in our laboratories, to systematically evaluate and compare the actions of anticholinergics to our neuromodulation approaches on the peripheral airways in vivo. We will evaluate two approaches that can induce a inhibition and/or withdrawal of cholinergic tone in the airways and thus bronchodilatation: the blockade of action potential conduction in the preganglionic parasympathetic nerves innervating the airways, and the selective activation of the large myelinated axons of slowly adapting stretch receptors. We will characterize the performance of Synapse over a range of stimulation frequencies and intensities for their ability to induce dilation of the airways and to reduce or eliminate airways hyper- responsiveness when placed unilaterally or bilaterally on the vagus nerves in acute and subchronic studies."
"9135948","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., teen unintended pregnancy and STIs remain at epidemic levels. Rates of teen fatherhood are especially high among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic teens. Initiatives to prevent teen pregnancy have focused primarily on female adolescents; how to effectively counsel young men to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy is unclear. We proposed to adapt, implement and rigorously evaluate an innovative computer-assisted motivational interviewing (CAMI) intervention, originally designed and implemented with girls, for use with young men, age 15-24 years old, to reduce their risk of fathering a teen pregnancy. We will use qualitative methods to modify the CAMI for use with young men. Then we will enroll 646 young men, ages 15 to 24 years, from 2 inner city high schools, a young men's clinic and from community agencies and randomize them to either a modified CAMI aimed at Teen Pregnancy Prevention (CAMI-TPP) or a CAMI aimed at diet, physical activity and tobacco use (CAMI- Fitness). The CAMI-TPP group will receive four, 30-minute MI coaching sessions over 12 weeks and one 30 minute booster at 6-months with a MI coach; sessions will be guided by a computer- generated, feedback aimed at increasing condom use, supporting female partners' contraceptive use, and completing a reproductive health visit with STI testing. The CAMI-Fitness group will receive four, 30-minute MI coaching sessions over 12 weeks and one 30 minute booster at 6-months with a MI coach; sessions will be guided by a computer-generated, feedback aimed at diet, physical activity and tobacco use. Both interventions are identical in length and timing but vary in the target behavior (pregnancy prevention versus fitness). We will track the two groups of young men through a 12 week intervention phase and a 12-month follow-up phase to assess differences in sexual and contraceptive behaviors by group. The specific aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the CAMI-TPP compared to CAMI-Fitness in reducing sexual behaviors that increase the risks of fathering an unintended teen pregnancy by increasing condom use and female partner use of moderately and highly effective reversible contraception. We hypothesize that the CAMI-TPP will increase the proportion of participants who report condom use at last intercourse as well as female partner use of contraception. We also predict that those who receive CAMI-TPP will report higher completion of a reproductive health service visit with STI and/or HIV testing over the course of study participation compared to those in the CAMI-Fitness group. If proven effective, the CAMI-TPP could be broadly implemented as a method to decrease the risk of young men fathering a teen pregnancy."

"9072834","PROJECT 1: PROJECT SUMMARY  Production of inflammatory cytokines and interferons by innate immune cells, within the tumor  microenvironment, is a major determinant of tumor progression. Damage-associated molecular pattern  (DAMP) recognizing receptors in myeloid cells are activated by ligands generated by the tumor cells, cytokines  are induced locally and act upon the tumor cells to promote or impair their proliferation. Recent literature  suggests that DNA and RNA are the major mediators of communication between the tumor cells and the innate  immune cells. Our interests are in analyzing the biochemical pathways of signaling elicited by specific nucleic  acid receptors in myeloid cells and investigating the effects of their manipulations in mouse models, which will  be greatly facilitated by the newly generated TLR3, TLR9 and EGFR conditional knock-out mouse lines. We  will test the hypothesis that the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor  (EGFR) is essential for signaling by the two endosomal Toll-like receptors, TLR3 and TLR9, and by STING, the  ER-bound mediator of cytoplasmic DNA signaling. Specifically, we will investigate the roles of EGFR and Src in  TLR3 and TLR9 signaling by determining the biochemical requirements for TLR, EGFR and Src interactions to  elicit signals. We will also identify the specific functions of EGFR and the adaptor protein, TRIF, in mediating  STING-signaling and their contributions to STING-mediated protection from viral pathogenesis in mice will be  evaluated. Finally, we will evaluate the role of EGFR-mediated cytokine production by myeloid cells in  regulating tumor growth in three murine model systems: chemically induced skin and colon cancers and  transplanted glioma. The above studies will illuminate the different mechanisms by which EGFR promotes  signaling by three intracellular nucleic acid DAMP- recognizing receptors and thereby affects tumor growth."
"9143139","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal responds to PA-14-004 Advances in Patient Safety through Simulation Research (R18). Suicide is a national public health crisis and a critical patient safety issue. It is the 10th leading cause of death overall and, tragically, the2nd leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults (15-34 years old). Research consistently shows that about half of individuals who die by suicide had contact with primary care providers within one month of their death. Despite these data and the fact that the National Quality Forum designates patient suicide as a never event (i.e., an adverse event that is unambiguous, serious, and usually preventable), there is no required training in suicide prevention for healthcare providers. Patient safety is compromised when primary care providers lack the knowledge and skills to assess and respond to patients at risk for suicide. Given the fact that patients will continue to seek services in primary care, particularly early in the trajecory of symptoms and stressors (i.e., upstream), it is imperative that providers-in-training are educated in identifying and responding to individuals at risk for suicide. This randomized trial brings together three domains to improve patient safety: the latest science about suicide from a public health perspective, effective suicide prevention training that is grounded in adult learning theory using simulation methods, and the context of a changing health care landscape where primary care providers are likely to encounter suicidal individuals. Given the high rate of death by suicide for adolescents and young adults, we will focus on assessing and responding to this population. Participants (pediatric and family medicine residents, nurse practitioner students, n = 108) will be randomized to suicide prevention video-based didactics (control group) or didactics plus two standardized patient interactions with feedback (experimental group) with an adolescent and/or young adult scenario. Both conditions will be assessed for suicide prevention skills during a standardized patient interaction. We hypothesize that both conditions will show improved knowledge as a function of didactic training but that those who had the opportunity to interact with 'at risk, suicidal standardized patients' will show better skills during the assessment, and report greater self-efficacy, intention and actual use of suicide prevention skills with patients. We will also explore, for the experimental group, moderators as well as differences between face-to-face and telehealth patient interviews. If results support the efficacy of the program, training materials, measures, and methods will be disseminated and future studies will expand to other provider and patient populations."

"9136069","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH) has been an integral part of the Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net) for ten years and impacted retail food safety at a national level. In support of the Healthy People 2020 Food Safety goals, HEALTH aims to reduce foodborne illnesses, disabilities, and death through interventions that target reducing food contamination from ill food workers, reducing hand contamination, improving controls through certified kitchen managers always being present during food preparation at food establishments, and improving regulatory effectiveness. Each intervention builds on prior EHS-Net findings that have identified factors associated with food safety issues, but shifts the research paradigm by utilizing a systems approach aimed at achieving maximum impact by targeting the culture of food safety at food service establishments. Reducing illnesses and outbreaks due to ill food workers will be the focus of the first two years of the grant. RI EHS-Net will deliver an intervention packet to all RI food establishments, reinforce with inspections, and compare critical violations before and after the intervention delivery. Behavioral factors will be evaluated at a subset of establishments and compared pre and post intervention using a survey designed to measure indicators of a positive food safety culture. Other proposed interventions will follow similar designs and be conducted in the years that follow. Results from the Certified Kitchen Manager intervention could be used to justify changing the Food Code to require a certified manager during all food preparation, or to mimic the Rhode Island law which allows requiring a CKM at all times if there are serious repeat operational violations. HEALTH has established an effective collaborative structure to achieve the outlined objectives. The Office of Food Protection, Division of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, and the State Health Laboratory are centrally located and will ensure effective, coordinated responses. The University of Rhode Island also supports this statewide initiative. HEALTH will collaborate with EHS-Net in the data analysis of all EHS-Net research projects. Results will be disseminated to the public health community through scientific journals, presentations, possible changes to the Food Code, and other means to encourage national changes in food safety practices."
"9074564","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mission of our Perimenopause in Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Program Project is to discover biological transformations in brain that occur during the perimenopausal transition that lead to endophenotypes predictive of risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our goals are to identify the mechanisms by which these transformations occur and to translate these discoveries into strategies to prevent conversion to an at-Alzheimer's-risk phenotype. Each year ~1.5 million American women enter into the perimenopause, a neuroendocrine transition state unique to the female. AD has a protracted preclinical phase that suggests that events early in the aging process can initiate vulnerability t late onset AD. The greatest risk factors for Alzheimer's disease are age, the APOE4 genotype4 and female sex. The proposed program of research builds on our discovery of the perimenopausal bioenergetic transition in brain and its predictive association with cognitive decline in postmenopausal women to investigate the impact of the APOE4 allele on this uniquely female aging transition. We hypothesize that the APOE4 genotype represents the first of three strikes to increase the risk for AD, with aging being the second, and the perimenopausal bioenergetic transition being the third and final strike that initiates risk of developing an at-AD-risk endophenotype in women. We propose that the APOE4 allele accelerates and magnifies the perimenopausal bioenergetic crisis in brain to accelerate and amplify the risk of AD. An interdisciplinary team with deep and broad expertise in aging and AD have created an integrated set of three Projects, supported by three cores, that address common hypotheses and program-wide aims at basic, clinical and population levels of analysis. Aim 1: Mechanistic Discovery (Projects 1 & 2): Determine APOE4 genotype regulation of the perimenopausal bioenergetic, inflammatory and lipid metabolism transitions in brain and their association with Alzheimer's pathology. Determine modulatory factors that reduce or exacerbate the impact of APOE4 genotype. Aim 2: Clinical Translation (Project 3): Determine impact of perimenopause and the APOE4 genotype on brain metabolism, burden of Alzheimer's pathology, structural integrity and cognitive function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Extend analyses of ELITE cohort (600 postmenopausal women) to determine impact of APOE4 genotype on metabolic cluster membership and longitudinal cognitive function. Aim 3: Global Population Translation (Project 3): Determine the impact of APOE4 genotype and menopause on the lifespan trajectories of 5000 women from 10,000+ MRI derived brain volume metrics, genetics and clinical data available through the ENIGMA network. ENIGMA data from 33,195 subjects (women and men) with MRIs and genome sequences will be investigated using a meta-regression model for the effect of age and APOE4 on brain atrophy. Outcomes of our research will provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the heightened risk of AD in APOE4 positive females and identify potential therapeutic targets and opportunities. Studies address NIA Strategic Goals A, C, D and E."
"9296211","ABSTRACT This foundational project will produce mesoscopic and microscopic functional anatomical maps of the sensory and autonomic (motor) neurons that regulate the lower urinary tract (LUT). Neural dysfunction is a major contributor to diverse, largely intractable urological problems, including overactive or underactive bladder, incontinence due to ageing or pelvic surgery, and painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis. We will fill knowledge gaps and overcome diverse technical roadblocks to develop maps that provide a critical foundation for modeling different LUT behaviors, understanding neuromodulatory mechanisms, and determining off-target effects of neuromodulation. We will conduct this study in adult rats, the species where the peripheral and spinal circuitry of the LUT is defined in the most detail and, compared with mice, their larger size facilitates development of devices. Together, this will facilitate development of new methods for normalizing over- or underactivity in these circuits. The aims to be addressed in males and females are: (1) To map functionally distinct classes of sensory and autonomic neurons that innervate the bladder body, trigone and proximal urethra. We will also map neurons that project to more than one of these regions (`cross-talk'). In addition to known functional markers of sensory and autonomic neural subtypes, we will use the latest outcomes of our RNA-seq analyses of retrogradely labeled bladder-projecting neurons to define and map new markers of functional subclasses. (2) To map the spinal targets of sensory neurons innervating the bladder body, trigone and proximal urethra. Using viral tracing we will map and characterize second order sensory neurons in autonomic reflex and nociceptive pathways; we will also identify sites of convergence from two peripheral targets. (3) To map the spinal neurons activated by physiologically- or electrically-induced voiding in conscious rats. Our recent advance of activating pelvic nerves in chronically- catheterized conscious animals will be combined with markers of neural activation, detailed phenotyping of activated neurons and viral tracing."
"9337971","This project is focused on the development of a unique GMP-compliant particle molding technology that we have pioneered called PRINT?

PRINT provides complete control over particle size, shape and chemical composition, and enables the systematic tailoring of antigen proximity to the particle, antigen density and particle size and shape to screen and identify the optimal particle parameters to elicit enhanced immunological responses. The down-selected particle parameters will provide design rules to manufacture influenza and dengue particulate multivalent vaccines to investigate the ability to generate a complete and robust neutralizing antibody response to each antigen. Also, additional Projects within our Program will utilize these multivalent particulate vaccines to address the use of novel adjuvants to modulate the immune response. These particulate vaccines will be evaluated in a humanized mouse model to determine how to prevent infection of homotypic or all 4 dengue virus serotypes. We will combine the learning from each Project to scale-up the most promising multivalent particulate vaccines and advance these to large animal challenge studies for both influenza and dengue. Due to the immediate medical need for multivalent vaccines for influenza and dengue and the cGMP-compliant nature of our particle molding technology, the formulations can be advanced into product development for human trials."

"9205404","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this application is to identify patterns of perceived stress, active coping style, health status and genes that contribute to longevity observed within African American families. We will examine these factors using vertical and horizontal approaches by studying similarities between siblings and parent-child pairs. To this end, we have the following questions:  1) Do familial effects (genes and shared environments) create similarity in the patterns of perceived tress and coping within and across generations?  2) Does stress account for differences in patterns of longevity between families?  3) Do psychosocial factors like stress, coping, and discrimination account for differences in patterns of health status and longevity between families?  4) What role do genes play in patterns of stress and longevity?  5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? To address these research questions, we have planned five specific aims: 1) Collect data from 750 older African Americans on perceptions of stress, discrimination, coping style, health, personality and genetics from multi-generation families (parent-child and siblings). 2) Examine similarities and differences in stress and coping, and health status among sibling pairs and across generations within families. 3) Compare the health status of siblings concordant for higher stress and poorer coping to those with lower stress and better coping. 4) Examine genes associated with stress and longevity in comparisons of long lived families and short lived families and among sibling pairs. 5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? This project is novel and innovative in that it will employ a multi method approach to understand longevity. It will use a quantitative genetic approach, a molecular genetic approach, and a multi generation approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time all of these methods have been employed on one sample."
"9351692","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern Kidney Transplant (SEKTx) Coalition is an academic-community collaboration between partners in the kidney disease community who share the common goal of eliminating health disparities in access to kidney transplantation among African American End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) living in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Volunteer members of this community-based coalition include ESRD and transplant patients, dialysis facility staff and providers, transplant centers, quality improvement organizations, and patient advocacy organizations. The burden of CKD and ESRD is highest in the Southeast, and yet the rate of kidney transplantation is the lowest in the nation. Further, our research suggests that racial disparities in access to transplant are concentrated in the Southeast, where African Americans (AA) are less likely to access each step in the transplant process. In 2014, our SEKTx Coalition conducted a randomized, multicomponent intervention (Reducing Disparities In Access to kidNey Transplantation [RaDIANT]) Community Study in GA, the state with the lowest kidney transplant rates in the nation, consisting of patient- and provider-focused educational and engagement interventions designed to increase referral for transplant evaluation among AA ESRD patients. This study was effective in improving referral for kidney transplantation among AA in GA, but efforts to improve access to kidney transplantation must be expanded beyond GA and should include interventions targeting steps beyond referral to the medical evaluation at the transplant center. The long-term goal of the SEKTx Coalition is to eliminate racial disparities in every step of the kidney transplant process. Our Specific Aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine reasons for racial disparities in medical evaluation for kidney transplantation among dialysis patients in GA, NC and SC. Specific Aim 2: Implement the RaDIANT Regional Study in GA, NC, and SC with the goal of increasing rates of referral, medical evaluation, and waitlisting, and reducing disparities in these key steps. Specific Aim 3: Conduct a process and outcome evaluation of the RaDIANT Regional Study interventions. The overall impact of this proposal is to improve transplant access among the AA ESRD population in the Southeast and reduce health disparities in transplantation."
"9226424","PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed R21 project will conduct two studies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and scalability of the Mothers and Babies 1-on-1 Course (MB) among home visiting (HV) programs. MB is a manualized 12-session intervention guided by cognitive-behavioral therapy and attachment theory. Each session lasts 15-20 minutes and is delivered as part of a regularly scheduled home visit. Previous MB trials suggest that the intervention is less successful for women who exhibit smaller changes in hypothesized intervention mechanisms and less fully engage in completion of personal projects. To address this limitation, Study 1 will determine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting MB-TXT, in which HV clients receive MB supplemented by a series of weekly text messages focused on skill reinforcement, personal project reminders, and self-monitoring of depressive symptoms. We will also calculate a preliminary effect size that could be used to calculate sample size necessary for a future fully powered RCT that examines MB-TXT efficacy. We will conduct a cluster RCT in which we randomize 3 HV programs to implement MB and 3 programs to implement MB-TXT. We will recruit 108 study participants (54 MB, 54 MB-TXT) with mild to moderately severe depressive symptoms and conduct baseline, 6-month, and 9-month assessments to assess depressive symptoms and hypothesized intervention mechanisms. Feasibility and acceptability data will be collected from clients and home visitors to assess percentages of received text messages, home visitor adherence to sending texts at specified intervals, and clients' perceptions of text message utility and clarity. Previous postpartum depression preventive interventions?including MB?have neglected to intervene with partners of pregnant women despite growing recognition that paternal depression exerts influence on children's social-emotional development. To address this limitation, Study 2 will develop a MB-DAD intervention protocol that provides text messages to male partners of HV clients. Focus groups with Study 1 RCT participants, their male partners, and HV staff will be used to develop the MB-DAD curriculum and protocol. MB-DAD text messages aim to improve the mental health of the male partner and help him support his partner's mental health. We will examine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the MB-DAD protocol and assess paternal and dyadic outcomes across two HV programs. We will recruit 24 mother-father dyads for an uncontrolled pilot in which mothers receive MB-TXT and fathers receive MB-DAD. Feasibility, acceptability, and outcome measures used in Phase 1 will be supplemented with assessments of fathers' mental health and partners' relationships. Participant assessments will be conducted at baseline and 6 months. The public health significance and innovation of this project is substantial. If we are able to integrate MB-TXT and MB-DAD into HV programs and generate improved mental health outcomes for HV clients and their partners, we will be prepared to replicate this intervention across HV programs nationally at a time when HV is rapidly proliferating through Affordable Care Act funding."

"9336676","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A range of neurological diseases are now being researched or treated using fully implantable electronic systems to either record or modulate brain activity in humans. These implants are currently being protected using polymer coatings that envelop the implant and help keep body fluids away from the sensitive electronics. Brain implants with complex three-dimensional geometries, like the Utah Electrode Array (UEA) shown in the figure, provide a challenge for current encapsulation techniques. Parylene has been the gold standard for encapsulation of neural and biomedical implants in general due to its well-suited combination of biocompatibility, electrical properties and chemical inertness. However recording capabilities of long-term neural implants (>6 months) encapsulated with Parylene show signs of degradation. To combat this problem Blackrock Microsystems proposes a novel bi-layer encapsulation scheme that combines Plasma Assisted Atomic Layer Deposited (PA-ALD) alumina layer underneath the Parylene layer. This encapsulation scheme, novel to biomedical field, will retain all the advantages of Parylene while utilizing vastly superior dielecric properties of underlying ALD alumina layer to create a much longer lasting and more electrically stable biomedical implants. This bi-layer encapsulation scheme may be seamlessly incorporated into our existing fabrication process flow for our flagship product, the UEA. The bi-layer The UEA with integrated electronics encapsulation method will work on different surfaces (metal, semiconductor, polymer, ceramic) and on devices with integrated wireless components making it ideal for coating any complex medical device intended for long term implant. The project has 4 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Optimize an ALD alumina/Parylene bi-layer encapsulation scheme and compare performance with Parylene-only encapsulation on test devices. Specific Aim 2: Develop etch methods to selectively expose active electrode sites on UEAs coated with optimized ALD alumina/Parylene bi-layer. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate charge injection/impedance characteristics of ALD alumina/Parylene bi-layer coated UEAs. Specific Aim 4: Comparison of in vivo performance of ALD alumina/Parylene bi-layer coated UEAs to Parylene-only coated UEAs.   Our preliminary results with Parylene and alumina coated planar interdigitated electrode (IDE) test structures are very promising in support of the proposed work. We have shown that the bi-layer encapsulation yields more stable leakage current, and stable impedance (with <5% change) at 67 ?C for about 5 months (approximately equivalent to 40 months at 37 ?C). This superior performance of bi-layer encapsulation suggests its potential usefulness for chronic implants with complex surface geometries. At the end of the Phase I 'Lab to Marketplace' SBIR project, Blackrock expects to have developed protocols and standards to transform this research from its current early-stage lab setting into a commercial-grade manufacture process."
"8998421","Project Summary  The Tobacco and Environmental Carcinogenesis Program, which received ?Outstanding? merit in its first  CCSG submission in 2010, assembles researchers committed to elucidating how exposures to tobacco and  environmental carcinogens cause cancer and how these exposures can be mitigated by risk reduction,  intervention, and communication strategies. Exposure to carcinogens represents a major cause of human  cancers yet individuals who have the same exposures do not all get cancer in the end-organ. This suggests  that significant inter-individual differences exist in cancer susceptibility. Understanding the basis of these  differences can lead to precision risk reduction, which represents the translational impact of the Program. The  foci of the Program is tobacco related cancers (e.g., lung) and asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, with a  developing effort in UV/light exposure and melanoma. Each area provides rich opportunities for inter-  Programmatic research. The Program owes its translational and transdisciplinary vision to Co-Leaders Drs.  Robert Schnoll, a leader in tobacco control, and Trevor Penning, an expert in environmental carcinogenesis.  The scientific aims of the Program are to: 1) Elucidate the pathways underlying exposure risk (e.g., risk factors  for tobacco dependence; environmental exposures and risk for mesothelioma and melanoma); 2) Identify the  mechanisms linking exposure to disease (e.g., steps in multi-stage carcinogenesis); 3) Evaluate methods for  exposure and risk reduction (e.g., tobacco cessation treatments; asbestos remediation; UV light protection);  and 4) Test methods of risk communication (e.g., tobacco marketing, regulatory science). Program members  collaborate extensively, particularly with the Cancer Control and Cancer Therapeutics Programs, on studies of  tobacco use, health communication, and smoking cessation, with the Cancer Therapeutics and Immunobiology  Programs on investigations in thoracic oncology and immunotherapies, and with the Melanoma and Cutaneous  Malignancies Program on UV/light issues. Seminal contributions during the project period include validating the  first genetically-informed biomarker for personalized smoking cessation treatment and identifying novel  mechanisms by which multi-organ carcinogens (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in tobacco smoke and  the environment are metabolically activated. The intra- and inter-Programmatic environment is facilitated by  active mentoring, symposia, working groups, and pilot grants. The 15 members, who are from five departments  and two schools, have $5.9M in external funding (annual direct costs); $5.8M is peer-reviewed and $2.6M is  NCI-funded. Collaborative grants include an NCI P50 Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (with Cancer  Control), a P30 Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET; with Cancer Control), a  Pharmacogenomics Research Network U01 (with Cancer Control), and an NIH P42 Superfund Research  Program on asbestos. Members authored 263 cancer-related publications (21% intra-Programmatic; 30%  inter-Programmatic; 46% multi-institutional) during the project period."
"9148178","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Explicating the neurobiological basis of cognitive functions such as visual short term memory has been a long standing goal of scientific research because it is essential for understanding normal cognitive functions and treating brain disorders that can devastate the ability to think and act. The proposed experiments will investigate the role of two brain areas, the posterior parietal and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in cognitive functions, relying on a non-human primate model. We will comparatively investigate the single-neuron and population responses in these two areas, with respect to visual short-term memory capacity, the influence of each brain area to memory involved behavior, and their functional plasticity as a result of training in short term memory tasks. These studies will help unveil the functional specialization of cortical areas involved in higher cognitive functions and offer insighs on normal cognitive processing as well as the consequences of brain injury and mental illness."
"9071750","PROJECT SUMMARY ? CANCER STEM CELLS PROGRAM  The Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) Program is based on two pivotal findings made by program members: 1) only  a small percentage of cells in tumors, the cancer stem or initiating cells, drive the growth and metastatic  capability of tumors. These cells must be eliminated to achieve a complete therapeutic response; and 2)  cancers frequently arise as the consequence of changes in self-renewal pathways, such as the Wnt and the  Hedgehog signaling cascades. The CSC Program postulates that self-renewal is a critical function of both  cancer stem cells and their normal counterparts and that self-renewal pathways may be co-opted in the  process of oncogenesis to support tumor growth. Based on these concepts, the overall goal of the Cancer  Stem Cells Program is to identify and characterize self-renewal pathways in model systems, normal tissues,  and solid tumors. These efforts require the strong integration of basic research with preclinical studies within  the program, as well as collaboration with clinical investigators in other programs.  Co-led by Michael Clarke, MD and Roel Nusse, PhD, the 20 members represent three schools (the School  of Medicine, the School of Humanities & Sciences and the School of Engineering) and 12 departments. The  research activities of the 20 investigators are supported by 41 peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated grants  (R01s and others). Peer-reviewed funding is a total of $18.3 million in total costs/year of which $3.3 million  is from the NCI, $7.4 million from other NIH sources, and $7.7 million from other peer-reviewed support.  Since 2009, program investigators have published over 300 manuscripts relevant to cancer stem cell  biology in peer-reviewed journals, of which 19% are intra-programmatic and 42% inter-programmatic, as  well as numerous externally collaborative manuscripts. The SCI will continue to be invaluable in seeding  innovative projects and assisting with the translation of the basic science findings from this program into  new clinical approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer."
"9195881","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, currently affecting over 5.3 million Americans, yet lacks an effective therapy. Neurofibrillary tangles are a hallmark of AD and primarily consist of phosphorylated tau protein aggregates. Suppressing the spread of tau during the pre-symptomatic stage will potentially provide a novel preventive therapeutic approach to AD. However, the molecular and cellular mechanism of the synaptic propagation of tau is largely unknown. Exosomes are thought to be important vehicles for the spread of tau; the presence of tau proteins in the exosome fraction of cerebrospinal fluid in AD patients provides strong evidence that this mechanism is an important aspect of the pathophysiology of AD in humans. We hypothesize that microglia apposed to synapses facilitate the spread of tau via phagocytosis and secretion of tau in exosomes, and that amyloid deposition as seen in the AD brain enhances the propagation of tau through microglial activation and co-secretion of inflammatory cytokines and tau protein. Our recent studycogently demonstrate that microglia efficiently phagocytize tau aggregates and then transfer them to neurons via exosomes (Asai H et al, Nat Neurosci 2015). Our work will be powered by novel mouse models that recapitulates tau propagation: The stereotactic injection of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing neuron-specific P301L tau into the medial entorhinal cortex shows that inhibition of exosome synthesis or depletion of microglia dramatically reduces tau propagation to the dentate gyrus in vivo. To support this evidence, we showed that stereotactic injection of tau-containing exosomes from microglia successfully spread tau into dentate granular cells of dentate gyrus in wild type mice. This approach will enable us to model tau propagation using exosomes isolated from human brain tissues and non-transgenic mice. This project will focus on characterizing the role of exosomal secretion in the propagation of tau along anatomically connected neural networks using these novel mouse models with three specific aims: 1) To characterize the composition and propagation property of exosomal tau isolated from human AD brain and its potential for the propagation, 2) To determine microglia or other cell types account for exosome secretion for tau propagation, and 3) To determine how exosomal tau propagation induces neurophysiological and morphological abnormality in novel tau propagation mouse models in vivo.  We anticipate that the results obtained from this proposal will lead to an entirely novel paradigm for delaying the progression of disease in AD and other tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Additionally, the proposed mouse models will have a wider application, including synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia) and prion diseases, since ?-synuclein and prion also spreads via exosomes."
"9138910","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The EPA estimates that one out of every four Americans lives within three miles of a hazardous waste site. Over 450,000 brownfield sites are awaiting remediation and 1,280 sites on the National Priorities List. Potential Responsible Parties or the Superfund program are tasked with remediating these sites, but insufficient funding and growing number of sites have led to significant delays. The US remediation market has been growing steadily since 2009, averaging 2-3% increases per year, and the global environmental remediation technology market is forecasted to expand to $80.5 billion in 2019. Clearly there is a societal need and market potential for innovative remediation technologies that decrease cost and increase efficacy. In Situ Chemical Oxidation (ISCO) is the fastest growing remediation technique as it is lower cost, more effective, and less disruptive than other methods. However, current ISCO methods require gaseous or liquid-form oxidizers that pose significant hazard to workers during transport and delivery and often require multiple injections, which increase cost and exposure risk.  AxNano, in collaboration with North Carolina A&T, has developed Controlled Release Polymer Structures (CRPS) as a slow release ISCO technology that will transform the environmental remediation industry by: (1) mitigating exposure risk during deployment by encapsulating the reactive agents within a safe, easy to handle, solid matrix; (2) allowing for efficient treatment of contaminated groundwater via sustained release of high doses of reactive agents with a single application.  This Phase I project will determine design parameters to enhance the efficacy of our patented CRPS for ISCO remediation of contaminated groundwater. The CRPS will be optimized by maximizing the oxidative agent(s) loading while maintaining a stable solid structure. Proof-of-concept tests will be conducted under varied conditions (i.e., pH, temperature, and density) in dynamic flow column studies that mimic those present in the subsurface environment. Broad spectrum efficacy of the optimized CRPS to transform two classes of Superfund-relevant contaminants (i.e., chlorinated compounds and polyaromatic hydrocarbons), will be tested over a range of concentrations to yield dose response curves. Collectively, the results of this Phase I will be used to model the performance of these materials in realistic environments and guide planning of pilot scale field studies. Phase I work will also involve designing a plan for scale-up manufacturing and preparing for pilot field testing. Scale-up design, cost of manufacturing, and deployment strategies of this solid phase material compared to current liquid and gaseous ISCO remediation technologies will also be evaluated in order to determine the feasibility of transitioning this technology to a commercial product."
"9167953","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is one of the most serious health threats to our entire population. Infections from resistant bacteria are now too common, and some pathogens have become resistant to multiple antibiotic classes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently estimated that drug-resistant bacteria account for more than 2 million illnesses and over 23,000 deaths every year in the U.S. With rising rates of drug-resistant infections, there is pressing need for new diagnostic methods that can rapidly determine the most effective therapy for an infection. Unfortunately, the current method for performing antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) involves growing microorganisms from clinical samples and determining their sensitivity to antibiotics through cell growth. This ?gold standard? technique is extremely time-consuming (minimum 48-72 hours) and can result in significant delays in appropriate therapy, prolonged illness, greater risk of death, inappropriate antibiotic use, and increased spread of resistance. For some infections like gonorrhea, AST is not even performed in the clinic and instead inferred based on treatment failure. In short, it is imperative that new strategies are developed to rapidly diagnose and prevent the amplification of drug resistance. Antibiotic exposure can trigger the expression of a signature set of mRNAs in susceptible microbes in as rapidly as a few minutes, raising the exciting possibility of using RNA detection ? not cell growth ? as a new means for rapid, phenotype-based AST. We will develop innovative RNA sensor technology that evaluates these molecular signatures within a clinically-relevant, low-cost, and easy-to-use diagnostic platform. To achieve this, we will use synthetic biology approaches to engineer highly-sensitive genetic sensors of mRNA. These sensors will be deployed in cell-free expression systems that can be arrayed and freeze-dried onto low-cost, solid-state substrates like paper. The result will be a new class of antibiotic diagnostics with ideal performance, storage, and distribution characteristics. The RNA sensor technology will be developed and validated with high priority bacterial organisms. Notably, we will, for the first time, define RNA signatures of susceptibility for N. gonorrhoeae, which the CDC recently elevated as a major cause for concern in the U.S. and for which AST capabilities do not currently existing in the clinical setting. This work will usher in a new technology for rapidly diagnosing antibiotic resistance, with the potential to transform the management of today's growing antimicrobial resistance problem."
"9137837","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the successful scale-up of HIV treatment in hyper-endemic settings, and a disease prevalence that may remain high for decades, comes a long-term healthcare commitment to an ageing HIV-infected population. As HIV-infected individuals live longer they will increasingly be affected by a double burden of both infectious and non-infectious diseases. We hypothesize that the current HIV-specific vertical programs are unlikely to maximize the total health of the HIV-positive individual and that in the coming years more integrated health care management - incorporating testing and treatment for diabetes, cancer, renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease and hepatitis, among other conditions - will be needed both to stop these diseases from undermining HIV programs and to maintain and improve the reductions in mortality that have begun in hyper-endemic settings.  We know this shift in disease burden is coming, but we do not know its magnitude, timing or character in detail; nor are the implications of this shift well understood; no work has established the priorit that should be placed on potential changes in health system organization. The only tool available to examine these issues at a population-scale is mathematical modelling. Therefore, we propose to construct a new mathematical model for Zimbabwe, using data from a long-running population-based HIV cohort, to develop innovative translational analyses to inform the evolution the AIDS response must take. Our aims are: 1. To construct a multiple-disease model tailored specifically to the HIV hyper-endemic African setting of Zimbabwe. The model will build on existing analyses of demographic, epidemic and program changes occurring in Zimbabwe, incorporate interactions between HIV and ART with major non-communicable diseases in this population - diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis and mental health issues - and major infectious diseases - tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, malaria, schistosomiasis. The model will also represent patterns of care-seeking behaviors and health system organization (screening different population, outreach to different group, integrating care across sectors to improve 'cascade' losses). 2. To use this model to forecast the changing disease burden in HIV-infected patients and the wider population. Specifically, the timing and scale of change and characterizing future patient profile (sex/age/multi-morbidities). 3. Identify optimal mode of integration of services across health areas. What screening and additional services will be required, for which patients; which demographics should outreach campaigns prioritize; where would integration of services and strengthening of the cascade of care be most valuable; what impact would these changes have on population health."
"9193235","Despite the considerable efforts of the VA to improve awareness of mental health problems and access to care, many returning veterans still report substantial barriers to seeking traditional mental health care. There is a large body of evidence demonstrating that aerobic exercise effectively improves many outcomes relevant to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) including; anxiety, depression, insomnia, cognition, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, there is a rapidly growing evidence base showing that aerobic exercise produces an increase in the growth of new neurons (e.g., neurogenesis) and increases the volume of the hippocampus which underscores the potential value of exercise for producing broad benefits to psychological health. Recognizing the promise that exercise might hold for attracting more veterans into care and improving overall health in veterans with PTSD, a team of investigators at the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center (SFVAMC) with funding from the Department of Defense developed a treatment protocol and completed a pilot study of Integrative Exercise (Aerobic exercise and Breath Training 3 weekly sessions over 12 weeks) versus a waitlist control condition. Promising results from this trial have led us to the next step which is to conduct a definitive efficacy study of Integrative Exercise versus an active health education control condition: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR). The control condition will be matched on contact hours with treatment personnel. The goal of this revised proposal is to test if Integrative Exercise improves overall quality of life, PTSD symptoms, sleep quality, and measures of cardiovascular health in combat Veterans with chronic PTSD relative to the IMR condition. Another goal is to test if improvements in quality of life are predicted by improvements in cardiovascular fitness as measured by exercise capacity on treadmill testing. Finally, the proposal will test if Integrative Exercise versus IMR will produce greater improvements in additional health outcomes, including mood, subjective sleep quality, and PTSD symptoms."
"9228745","ABSTRACT Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that arises from the action of both genetic and environmental factors. The Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) assembled data and biospecimens, including serum, plasma, DNA, PBMCs, and EBV-transformed B cell lines from more than 4,000 affected sibpair (ASP) families. As leaders of the T1DGC, we conducted a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) that identified more than 40 statistically significant T1D risk loci. We followed the GWAS with fine mapping each T1D locus with the ImmunoChip. This resulted in identifying sets of 99% credible SNPs (those most likely to be causal) within each locus. Our interrogation of data from ENCODE and the Epigenomics Roadmap revealed that the set of T1D credible causal SNPs was enriched for overlap with enhancer chromatin states in immunologically relevant tissues (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD34+ stem cells). In response to these findings, the NIDDK has issued RFA-DK-15-025, ?Mechanisms Underlying the Contribution of Type 1 Diabetes Risk-Associated Variants (DP3)?. As the T1D-associated credible SNPs are enriched in regulatory regions, we propose to directly examine these SNPs in T and B cells from our viably frozen T1DGC PBMC collection. We will focus on the accessible chromatin landscape at T1D risk loci, using ATAC-seq and characterize the impact of these SNPs on gene expression using RNA-seq in the same cells from the same individuals. Finally, we will test the function of the variants that impact chromatin accessibility and gene expression by perturbation experiments using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, followed by validation by gene expression and other functional assays. Our Specific Aims are to (1) identify T1D-associated SNPs that alter chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq in T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and B cells (CD19+) from 200 unrelated T1D cases and 200 unrelated controls (Caucasian and African-American); (2) define the effect of SNPs influencing the chromatin landscape on gene expression using RNA-seq in the same cells as profiled in Aim 1; and (3) experimentally validate regions of open chromatin affected by T1D-associated non-coding credible variants that alter gene expression in existing T1DGC EBV-transformed B cells (from the same participants providing PBMCs in Aims 1 and 2) and in T cells using CRISPRa to activate regions of closed chromatin and CRISPRi to inhibit/repress regions of open chromatin. This innovative and cost-effective proposal will leverage existing samples, prior genotyping and phenotyping of T1DGC resources, and an established team of experts in cutting-edge technologies and analysis. The findings obtained from this research will provide mechanisms of the functional basis of T1D- associated variants that will inform therapeutic considerations."
"9353491","The world's population is growing older and this is accompanied by increasing incidence in health decline and greater risk for disease. A goal of the proposed study is to develop an accelerated aging model in SIV- infected rhesus macaques undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) and test proof-of-concept for delaying or reversing the rate of aging, inflammation, and disease. This strategy is based on the observation that while ART is tremendously successful in extending the survival of HIV-infected individuals, there occurs an accelerated aging process exemplified by earlier onset of chronic inflammatory diseases compared to uninfected individuals of similar age. Macrophages are key cells involved in innate immunity, are central to regulating inflammation and contribute to pathogenesis during both aging and HIV infection. During aging, macrophages become dysfunctional and are less able to maintain homeostasis leading to increased susceptibility to infectious and non-communicable diseases. An accelerated model of aging in rhesus macaques will reduce the experimental timeline for testing anti-aging strategies in an animal model that is directly applicable to humans. Our hypothesis is that SIV-infected and ART-treated rhesus macaques undergo accelerated aging similar to humans, and that short-term depletion of senescent macrophages will reverse or delay the onset of accelerated aging sequelae. The specific aims are: Aim 1. Develop a model of accelerated aging in SIV-infected and ART-treated rhesus macaques. Rhesus macaques of 10-12 years of age (~30-40 years of age in humans) will be infected with SIV and administered ART. Based on preliminary results, we hypothesize that initiating ART after blood monocyte turnover rate increases 20% over baseline levels will result in a faster rate of aging based on time until and level of inflammation, tissue damage, and disease. Conversely, we expect that if ART is initiated before blood monocyte turnover increases, the rate of aging and immune senescence will be slower. The results will determine which ART initiation schedule will be applied for targeting senescent or dysregulated macrophages. Aim 2. Determine if replacement of senescent dysregulated macrophages ameliorates inflammation in SIV-infected macaques undergoing ART to reverse accelerated aging. The ?middle-aged? rhesus macaques will be infected with SIV and given ART before or after monocyte turnover increases, depending on which ART timing produces the most accelerated rate of aging. We will then administer liposome-alendronate /clodronate (bisphosphonates) and hypothesize that this will remove senescent long-lived macrophage and stimulate endogenous cell recruitment or trafficking (e.g. monocytes) for replacement with fresh functional macrophages that will better regulate inflammation and reverse the rate of accelerated aging."
"9216485","Background. A significant and growing population of young people are acquiring and living with HIV in the US. An estimated >12,200 adolescents were diagnosed with HIV infection in 2010, a 22% increase since 2008(1). Although HIV can be managed with ongoing antiretroviral therapy (ART), exceptionally high levels of adherence are required. Our recently published systematic literature review found that of the 21 articles published that reported data on medication adherence in HIV infected adolescents, seven described pilot interventions to enhance medication adherence; and only two utilized education / counseling sessions to promote adherence skills-building ? a component that has shown to be necessary to improving adherence among HIV-infected adults. To our knowledge, there are no demonstrated efficacious ART adherence interventions for HIV infected adolescents to date. This is particularly concerning given that overall rates of adherence among adolescents is generally suboptimal. Overview of Proposal. This proposal is culmination of 6 years of formative work with this population, including conducting two pilot randomized controlled trials (RCT). The current study is to test the efficacy of a stepped-care ?adaptive? ART adherence intervention (?Positive STEPS?) for HIV infected adolescents, ages 16 to 24. Stepped care is a healthcare delivery model in which the least resource intensive part of an intervention is delivered first, and only those who do not improve then receive the high intensity, more resource intensive part of an intervention. Conceptual Model. The conceptual model is based on our formative work that led to the development of a theoretically-driven intervention curriculum (?Positive STEPS?), grounded in the social and contextual realities of HIV infected adolescents. Our intervention begins with 2-way daily text messaging aimed at improving ART adherence. For many adolescents (over 1/3 from our pilot RCT), text messaging is not sufficient to overcome the barriers to ART adherence. These individuals will then also receive the more intensive component based on general principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Informational, problem solving, and cognitive-behavioral ?steps? are addressed over 5, in-person, intervention-counseling sessions (incorporating digital video vignettes that are specific to the adherence challenges faced by adolescents). Overview of Research Plan. 192 HIV infected adolescents, aged 16 to 24, and prescribed ART will be recruited in two major U.S. cities with excellent access to and research experience with the population. Participants will be equally randomized to: (1) ?Positive STEPS? ? a stepped care, adherence intervention with integrated technology and counseling; or (2) Standard of Care comparison group. Participants will be followed for one-year post-randomization. The primary outcomes are improvements in measures of ART adherence (i.e., Wisepill, HIV viral load, and self report); secondary outcomes include improvements in CD4 cell count, HIV symptoms, and quality of life."

"9201150","Mold was nominated to the NTP for toxicological characterization and based on their inhalation, mycological, and immunological expertise, NIOSH was engaged as a partner to conduct multiple sub-chronic (13-week) exposure studies to individual organisms or mixtures of molds mimicking a real-world exposure. NIOSH has developed a system that allows for precisely controlled exposures to particulates via inhalation. This approach overcomes a number of limitations associated with previous mold exposure studies in experimental animal models that have used less relevant means of exposure to assess fungal toxicity. The acoustical generation system (AGS) developed as part of this partnership delivers fungal test articles to mice in a manner that simulates natural indoor fungal contaminant exposure. NIOSH continues to use the AGS and state-of-the-art methodologies to characterize toxicological endpoints following subchronic dry fungal spore and particle exposures. Following the completion of an NTP Study to evaluate the effects of exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus, NIOSH has begun studies to characterize pulmonary immune responses to Stachybotrys chartarum (mycotoxin producing chemotype). A S. chartarum dosimetry study identified doses that resulted in an immunologic response but not overt toxicity. Preliminary data derived from 4 week and 13 week exposures showed an early Th2 response after 4 weeks of exposure that shifted toward a Th1 dominant response after 13 weeks of subchronic inhalation exposure to S. chartarum conidia. Macrophages were elevated after 4 and 13 weeks of exposure, along with increased arg1, retnla and il33 expression, that suggested ongoing inflammation. Eosinophil levels were dramatically increased after 4 weeks but were decreasing by 13 weeks, potentially attributed to increased ccl11 and cxcl5.  A target organ toxicology study that evaluated a mycotoxin producing chemotype of S. chartarum, was also completed this year and histopathology assessment of the tissues is underway.  In addition to the evaluation of the high mycotoxin producing S. chartarum strain, NIOSH developed a method to heat inactivate S. chartarum spores and optimized the growth conditions of a low mycotoxin producing strain of S. chartarum.  A 13 week pulmonary immunology study of this strain of S. chartarum is ongoing."
"9168029","ABSTRACT Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that causes cognitive and physical disability. MS is characterized by demyelination, inflammation, lesion formation and neurodegeneration. Cholesterol is a key lipid in the myelin sheath and is critical for myelin function. Disease progression is a significant challenge in MS therapeutics because the currently available immunomodulatory drugs do not halt the neurodegenerative processes that are responsible for brain atrophy and disability progression. Compelling recent evidence from our research indicates that serum cholesterol and lipoprotein profiles are associated with disability changes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of lesion formation and neurodegeneration in patients with established MS and in the earliest stages of MS following the first demyelinating event. The mechanisms underlying these pathophysiological associations of cholesterol biomarkers with brain injury in MS are not known. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that the associations between serum cholesterol and brain injury in MS are driven by key contributions from oxysterols, which are promising molecular mediators for these pathophysiological associations because they can cross the blood brain barrier and also regulate cholesterol homeostasis in the brain and the periphery. Oxysterols, particularly 24-hydroxy cholesterol (24HC), 27-hydroxy cholesterol (27HC), 7?-hydroxy cholesterol (7?HC) and 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) are of interest because they are potent transcription factor ligands and regulatory mediators of cholesterol and immune homeostasis. The goal is to investigate the role of oxysterols and cholesterol pathway biomarkers in MS disease progression. In Specific Aim 1, we will compare the longitudinal changes in a focused panel of major oxysterols in serum at baseline and after 5 years in MS patients compared to controls and investigate their associations with serum lipids. In Specific Aim 2, we will measure select downstream molecular targets of oxysterol signaling and identify the oxysterols and oxysterol target molecules associated with progression of brain injury over 5 years. We hypothesize that decreased 24-hydroxy cholesterol, decreased 7?-hydroxy cholesterol, increased 27- hydroxy cholesterol and increased 7-ketocholesterol levels in serum are associated with greater neurodegeneration. The study will use serum samples obtained at baseline and 5-year follow-up from 150 MS patients and 50 controls. The patients' serum samples will be analyzed for oxysterol and oxysterol targets. Aim 1 will leverage sensitive and selective state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assays capable of simultaneously quantitating multiple oxysterols. We will have longitudinal clinical and quantitative MRI data for this cohort. When successfully completed, this project will identify molecular mechanisms that will better define the pathophysiological role of the cholesterol pathway in MS disease progression."
"9320330","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the central problems in modern human genetics is to understand the functional impact of genetic variation. Of the millions of DNA positions that vary among humans, which sites actually impact human phenotypes and disease? It is becoming increasingly clear that noncoding variants that impact gene regulation play central roles in the genetics of disease, yet these variants remain difficult to interpret. Inthis project we will use rheumatoid arthritis as a model system for tackling these problems, using a combination of computational and experimental techniques. On the computational side, we will develop statistical approaches for integrating functional information from genome-wide assays with data from GWAS studies for complex traits. Our work will allow us to infer which cell-types are most important for any given disease, to improve mapping power, and to improve our ability to identify the most likely causal variants. We also propose novel approaches to validation, based on measuring cellular phenotypes in sorted immune cells and performing genome editing of specific sites. We anticipate that our work will lead to detection and validation of novel RA loci, as well as new techniques of general utility in this field."
"9234352","Tailored Health Self-Management Interventions for Highly Distressed Family Caregivers In the United States, family members serve as unpaid informal caregivers for more than 10 million adults with bipolar disorder. These family caregivers are highly distressed as they experience the fluctuating moods, intensity, and unpredictability associated with bipolar disorder. Bipolar symptom exacerbation, relapse, inability to manage daily activities, and need for ongoing treatment for the person with bipolar disorder, put family caregivers at great risk for compromised mental and physical health. These caregivers have been found to experience greater distress than caregivers of persons with diabetes, hypertension, asthma or dementia and have significantly more mental and physical health problems than the general population, leading to greater use of mental health and primary care services. When their health declines, symptom exacerbation, affective episodes, and re-hospitalization of the diagnosed family member increase. Existing family therapy and education interventions for these caregivers have had little effect on their own health. Health self-management interventions, particularly those tailored to address caregivers' needs and preferences for education, stress management, or resourcefulness skills, have not been examined in this population. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate how varying levels of participation by family caregivers in selecting self-management interventions (ranging from no input into the selection to selection based on caregiver need or preference) affect their health risks and physical and mental health over time. Caregivers will be randomized to: 1) a control group (no intervention); 2) education (usual care); 3) self-management intervention based on need (SM-need); or 4) self-management intervention of their preference (SM-preference). The study aims to: 1) examine differences across the four groups on caregiver health over time; 2) explore relationships between caregiver needs and preferences and relevant contextual factors (care recipient symptoms, caregiver reactions, and caregiving involvement); and 3) build caregiver profiles that are associated with their needs and preferences for intervention. Caregivers in the SM-need and SM-preference groups will receive one of three interventions tailored to match their need or preference: 1) education; 2) biofeedback; or 3) resourcefulness training. Family caregivers will be assessed at baseline (T1), 6 months (T2) and one year (T3). Repeated measures multivariate analyses will address the study aims. The findings from this study will generate new scientific knowledge about the effectiveness of novel, easy to use, independently performed interventions that can be self-tailored to promote caregiver health through education, biofeedback, or resourcefulness. Once established, these health self-management interventions can be tailored to match the needs and preferences of other comparably distressed family caregivers of persons with other chronic mental or physical conditions."
"9329917","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain affects 100 million people in the United States at an annual cost surpassing $600 billion (2011 IOM report). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are functional chronic pain disorders of unknown etiology that are more prevalent in women, the pain fluctuates across the menstrual cycle, and the conditions are triggered/exacerbated by stress. The mechanisms underlying these conditions are not well understood so treatment options are poor. These conditions along with other functional pain syndromes overlap in presentation (>60% of TMD patients have IBS) further complicating pain management. A new experimental paradigm in rats models these comorbid pain conditions. Sub chronic stress induces transient visceral hypersensitivity that persists about 1 week. This new model of comorbid pain employs masseter muscle inflammation, modeling TMD, prior to the sub chronic stress to induce estrogen-dependent visceral hypersensitivity, modeling IBS. This comorbid visceral hypersensitivity persists months longer than the, transient visceral hypersensitivity induced by stress or masseter inflammation alone. Three specific aims will examine peripheral and spinal mechanisms that contribute to the acute (2 days) and chronic (1 month) phases of the comorbid visceral hypersensitivity. It is hypothesized that as the effects of the stress component of the acute/transient visceral hypersensitivity recede, there is a shift from peripheral to spinal mechanisms to maintain the chronic comorbid visceral hypersensitivity. Aim 1 will examine colonic afferent activity and the effects of peripheral CRF and mast cells in the acute and chronic phases. Aim 2 will examine changes in spinal visceroceptive neuron activity during the transition from acute to chronic pain. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that unique gene signature sets, canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways and gene ontologies are enriched in anatomically relevant pain regions (colon, DRG, spinal cord) in the acute and chronic phases of comorbid visceral hypersensitivity. Successful completion of these specific aims will increase our understanding of mechanisms that contribute to the overlap of functional pain disorders, specifically TMD and IBS."
"9104290","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will answer important questions regarding remediation of cognitive decline in older adults and address two critical areas of training: advanced imaging (magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional connectivity) and cognitive/clinical aging interventions (cognitive training). The PI is a cognitive neuroscientist wth a strong background in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), cognition, and electrophysiology, as well as a basic understanding of magnetic resonance imaging. The K01 will provide protected time and training to focus his research career firmly in cognitive aging, specifically focusing on the development of novel non- invasive treatments for age-related cognitive decline. This training will afford the knowledge required to translate his basic science expertise into clinical translational applications in aging populations.  The current study will investigate a method for enhancing cognitive training effects in healthy older adults and improving functional transfer of skills by employing a combined intervention approach targeting facilitation of neural plasticity and optimal learning state. Adults over the age of 65 represent te fastest growing portion of the US population. As such, age-related cognitive decline represents a major concern for public health. Recent research suggests that cognitive training in older adults can have lasting effects on performance, lasting up to 10 years. However, these effects are typically limited to the tasks trained, with little transfer to other cognitive abilities or evryday skills. This study will examine the impact of pairing cognitive training with tDCS. Individual effects of tDCS and cognitive training on cognitive, functional, and neuroimaging measures will be assessed. tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that directly stimulates brain regions involved in active cognitive function and enhances neural plasticity when paired with a variety of cognitive tasks. We will compare changes in cognitive and brain function resulting from cognitive training and cognitive training combined with tDCS using a comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical, and multimodal neuroimaging assessment of brain structure, function, and metabolic state. Functional connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to assess the coherence of brain response during working memory and focused attention; the active cognitive abilities trained by cognitive training. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will assess cerebral metabolites, including GABA concentrations sensitive to neural plasticity in task-associated brain ROIs. We hypothesize that: 1) tDCS will enhance neurocognitive function, brain function, and functional improvements from cognitive training; 2) Effects of tDCS on cognitive training will be maintained up to 3 months following training; and 3) Neuroimaging biomarkers of cerebral metabolism, neural plasticity (GABA concentrations) and coherence of functional brain response (fMRI) in default network and functionally relevant brain regions will predict individual response to cognitive training and tDCS."
"9150539","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most expensive upper extremity work-related musculoskeletal disorder, impacting 10 million people annually and costing employers up to $113,695 per incident. Although many etiologic mechanisms have been identified, one set of factors cannot accurately predict carpal tunnel syndrome development. As a result, carpal tunnel syndrome interventions are often provided reactively after initial symptom reports or inefficiently to employees perceived to be at risk. As the disorder progresses, it becomes increasingly expensive to treat and functional limitations become more challenging to remediate. There is currently no established method to detect this disorder prior to the onset of symptoms and nerve damage. Preliminary research suggests that sonography-a relatively inexpensive, widely available, increasingly portable technology-can provide a non-invasive and pain-free method of early detection that could reduce incidence, improve targeted interventions and ultimately reduce costs. Sonographic imaging has been used in an animal model to observe early progressive increases in median nerve size due to task exposure. By understanding this progression in humans, it would be possible to develop an early detection technique to stop, slow, or reverse this disorder before it becomes costly and debilitating. Thus, the long-term goal of this work is to develop a model of morphologic changes predictive of the onset and development of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. As a first step, this study will establish predictive validity of a novel method for early detection using sonographic imaging and identify task components of intensive functional hand activity associated with morphologic changes. This longitudinal study will follow dental hygiene students-a high-risk population with minimal retrospective and controlled prospective task exposure-for two years to investigate these aims. This research is directed at the National Occupational Research Agenda's (NORA) Healthcare and Social Assistance sector with a focus on the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Exposure Assessment and Musculoskeletal Disorders cross-sectors. Intermediate outcomes of this research will establish sonographic imaging as an early detection tool for workplace-screening and inform methods for combining measures of nerve morphology, neurophysiology, and subjective symptoms for predicting the development of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. This work will also inform the development of targeted preventive interventions for task components of intensive hand activities that are related to changes in tissue morphology. Finally, this work will provide access to a cohort of individuals who can be followed as they transition into the workforce to document the natural development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Identifying morphologic changes in early-stages of pathology and the specific task components linked to these changes are the first steps toward early detection and prevention of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome."
"9239050","PROJECT ABSTRACT Nearly 50 million people have surgery each year in the United States, approximately one million develop serious complications, and over 150,000 die within 30 days. Health-care-associated infections (HAIs), the most common complications in surgical patients, place a huge burden on patients, their families, the healthcare system, and society. As there is a clinical and economic imperative to decrease surgical complications, efficient and accurate reporting of HAIs is paramount. Unfortunately, the current model of HAI reporting routinely involves data collection that is inaccurate, burdensome and/or expensive. Achieving accurate and efficient automation of data collection for performance measures, including HAIs, will not only support better local surgical quality improvement, but also will accelerate the transition from process to outcome-based measures suitable for value-based purchasing, new models of physician payment, and public reporting. This proposal attempts to address this challenge by leveraging currently available informatics technologies to automate the data collection from electronic health records for HAIs and other surgical performance measures. We hypothesize that, using advanced informatics methods combined with an iterative process that is informed by multidisciplinary input, data from electronic health records can be mined to develop scientifically valid, cost- effective outcome measures which will compare favorably with those derived from ACS NSQIP data, a clinical registry recognized for its rigorous accuracy. We will test and optimize the algorithms at five unique hospitals in four health systems and two electronic health record vendors to begin to determine the scalability of this approach. The American College of Surgeons (ACS), the primary site, has the content expertise, clinical registry and national influence necessary to drive change in the approach to performance measurement in surgery. We have assembled an accomplished team of national leaders in surgical outcome measurement and data (Clifford Ko, MD, MHS), quality improvement and implementation science (Elizabeth Wick, MD, Peter Pronovost, MD, PhD), informatics (Genevieve Melton, MD, Ph.D., Quintiles), and hospital epidemiology (Trish Perl, MD, MPH). Successful completion this work will impact the field in three main ways: 1) make available a strategy to automate five NQF-endorsed performance measures from the EHR; 2) provide essential knowledge about what is required at the hospital level to automate outcome measurement and the scalability of this approach to multiple hospitals, and; 3) accelerate transition from the use of process to outcome measures for value-based purchasing and physician payment models. The proposed research is novel and timely, and is the next important step on the path to making valid surgical performance measures available to all hospitals and clinicians, and ultimately the public.  "
"9167004","Project Summary/Abstract Gene expression is regulated at multiple layers, from histone modifications (histone code) through RNA processing to protein degradation. Most layers are extensively studied because of their fundamental importance to biology and because dysregulation at each layer can lead to diseases. However, the regulatory role of specialized ribosomes (ribosome code) is largely unexplored because, despite decades of research, the evidence that ribosomes can actively regulate gene expression had remained indirect and inconclusive; multiple studies have shown that mutations in core ribosomal proteins (RPs) have highly RP-specific phenotypes in processes including cell differentiation, aging and carcinogenesis. These correlative associations and my observations of differentiation RP transcription motivated me to directly test whether wildtype cells build specialized ribosomes. To this end, I developed methods for direct, accurate and precise measurements of protein levels and synthesis rates. These methods allowed me to obtain the first direct evidence for differential stoichiometry among RPs in unperturbed yeast and mammalian stem cells. Here I propose to substantially expand this methodology and use it to investigate ribosome-mediated translational regulation in the context of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). Previous research has indicated that knockdowns of some RPs can specifically prevent stem-cell differentiation but not self-renewal and these observations dovetail with my preliminary data indicating change in the ribosomal composition during ESC differentiation. I propose to build upon these results by: (i) employing and expanding my newly-developed methodology for building the first comprehensive map of ribosome modifications, (ii) mapping specific interactions between mRNAs and ribosome modification, (iii) associating these interactions with functional impact on the rates of translation initiation and elongation, and on cell differentiation, and (iv) testing causal mechanisms suggested by these associations by genetic manipulations of RP. The proposed methods and experiments have the potential to overcome longstanding roadblocks and to lay the groundwork for understanding ribosome-mediated translational regulation."
"9302987","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Great strides have been made recently in understanding cerebral cortical microcircuits. The introduction of transgenics and optogenetics together with advances in patch clamp techniques, have been instrumental in the rapid rate of discovery. For example, we now know there are at least three types of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex: those that express the Ca++ binding protein parvalbumin (PV), and those that use either the peptide neuromodulator vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or somatostatin (SOM). Uniquely labeling these neurons reveals that these inhibitory interneurons exist in most areas of cerebral cortex. They have different morphologies, terminate on different parts of output neurons, have differing synaptic strengths and they play different roles in information processing. In this application, we propose to capitalize on the recent advances in transgenics and optogenetics to reveal the structure and function of inhibitory microcircuits within the superior colliculus and the role external inputs play in modulating these circuits. We have three aims. First, determine the physiology and targets of the local parvalbumin (PV) expressing neurons in the visuosensory layer of the collicular microcircuit. These experiments will test the hypothesis that PV neurons provide the dominant source of inhibition on sensory neurons that give rise to the colliculo-pulvinar-cortical pathway and to the descending intralaminar pathway to the motor layer. Second, determine the physiology and targets of extrinsic GABAergic inputs from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (nigra) to the motor layer collicular microcircuit. These experiments will test the hypothesis that external inhibition from the nigra is the dominant source of inhibition on motor output neurons in the superior colliculus microcircuit. Third, determine the function of the PV and nigral GABAergic inputs to collicular microcircuits. We will test the hypothesis that inhibition from PV neurons and inhibition from the nigra play different roles in determining response gain of collicular neurons in sensory and motor neurons. Because PV neurons have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disease processes the results of our experiments should clarify how these neurons contribute to higher mental function."
"9151192","ABSTRACT Diversity in biomedical sciences is essential as the talents, experiences and perspectives within diverse groups are necessary for the progression of research and society. Genomics, bioinformatics and newer fields that have stemmed from these areas are growing and will rely on the participation of underrepresented (UR) groups as practitioners and community members for future advances in these areas. However, there is great disparity in degree attainment among UR groups in the broader fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in baccalaureate degrees, doctoral degrees and the professoriate. The goals of the Opportunities in Genomics Research (OGR) Program at the McDonnell Institute at Washington University are to increase the recruitment and retention of underrepresented (UR) students in genomics fields and to increase their rate of matriculation into highly competitive genomics and bioinformatics Ph.D. programs. Since 2012, the percentage of OGR students entering Ph.D. programs has increased by 14% compared to the first five year of the program 2007-2011. Building on this success, OGR participants will continue to engage in activities designed to prepare them for productive careers in genomics and related fields. We propose to improve student skills in bioinformatics through workshops and courses, giving students a better foundation to enter these graduate programs. We also propose a graduate fellowship for UR students at Washington University focused on the emerging field of precision medicine. Additional features of this program will include a partnership with a minority-serving institution that is among the top ranked for graduating UR students in STEM. We will disseminate portions of our program through this partnership via live and online workshops, with plans for expansion to other institutions so that more UR students are prepared for the graduate application process. Taken together, the expanded OGR program will help us to remove barriers in STEM education for UR students who desire to pursue these fields."
"9236876","Abstract: Normalizing plasma glucose via intensive insulin therapy reduces the incidence of diabetic complications, but the benefits of such regimens remain limited by frequent and severe bouts of hypoglycemia. These bouts diminish the brain's capacity to detect subsequent hypoglycemia and to activate protective counterregulatory hormonal responses, with reduced glucagon and epinephrine release, thereby increasing the risk of more severe hypoglycemic events with adverse consequences including seizures, coma and permanent brain injury. Studies in older adults with type 2 diabetes have identified hypoglycemia as the major risk factor contributing to increased mortality, cardiovascular disease, falls and even dementia, highlighting the need for its diligent avoidance and individualized treatment targets. This is of particular concern in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who often have had several decades of disease exposure at a much younger age. A recent study of elderly T1DM patients found hypoglycemia unawareness and glycemic variability to be key risk factors for additional severe hypoglycemic episodes and impaired cognition, further underscoring the unmet need to comprehensively define brain adaptations to hypoglycemia and to identify preventative strategies that improve glycemic control. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and carbon-13 acetate both in rodent models and T1DM patients we found that enhanced brain energy substrate uptake and utilization are the hallmarks of altered brain metabolism after recurrent hypoglycemia and that increased alternate fuel levels in the brain impair hormonal counterregulation. Encouragingly, it was shown that strict avoidance of hypoglycemia via meticulous glucose control can restore hormonal responses and hypoglycemia awareness. Predictive low glucose management (PLGM) systems combine the advantages of sensor augmented pump therapy with automated basal insulin suspension to reduce hypoglycemia exposure. PLGM outperforms currently available basal insulin suspension technology for hypoglycemia prevention. However, the safety and clinical efficacy of this intervention, and the effect on counterregulation in older adults, have not been defined. Therefore the goals of this proposal are to implement a PLGM system in older T1DM patients in order to reverse brain metabolic adaptations and restore metabolic sensitivity, hypoglycemia awareness and appropriate counterregulatory hormonal responses. The ultimate purpose of our studies is to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of a technology-driven approach in older adults with T1DM to achieve tight glycemic control without exposing these particularly vulnerable patients to the risks of profound hypoglycemia. To approach this aim we have assembled a highly skilled interdisciplinary team of translational scientists from endocrinology, magnetic resonance (MR) research and geriatrics who are experts in brain metabolism in T1DM, development of MR methodology, clinical implementation of artificial pancreas systems, and recruitment, assessment and retention of older persons."
"9339889","There is no change to the original grant, or scope of the work. Abstract remains unchanged. See grant. ABSTRACT It is widely recognized that colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most preventable cancers. If adenomatous polyps detected by screening were removed before they transformed into cancers, a decrease in new CRCs and in related mortality would follow. Unfortunately, cancer screening rates are low throughout Appalachia, including for Latino residents in PA. Further, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed at later stage than Whites, have a lower survival rate and less access to quality treatment. Our long-term goal is to increase CRC screening uptake among Latinos in urban and rural central Pennsylvania (PA). Our central hypothesis is that a targeted CRC screening intervention can increase uptake over a non-targeted approach for this population. The specific objectives of the current proposal are to develop, implement and evaluate a targeted CRC screening intervention to increase CRC screening uptake. We will measure actual CRC uptake in both the control and intervention arm as a method to determinate completion rates. To prepare for my K01 application during my post-doc training, I led the design, implementation, and analysis of a CRC-related Latino study that provided preliminary data for theK01 work. In 04/09, utilizing the ACCN coalitions in PA, I conducted eight focus groups (FG) to identify barriers to CRC screenings among Latinos. We identified several substantial barriers to CRC screening for this population, including a significant barrier heretofore unmentioned in literature related to CRC screenings. Spanish-speaking patients want to have family members or close friends in the doctor office and health-related education classes. This barrier was reported across all groups and likely links to the desire for a strong social support that influences their CRC screening behavior. Another finding is that urban residents had some prior knowledge of risk factors associated with CRC screening while rural residents reported no prior knowledge and were unable to list any associated CRC risk factor. A high acceptability of the provider-recommended take-home fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for these Latinos was also reported. We exceeded our study recruitment goal. The same partnered Latino leaders are committed to the K01 proposed work. The K01 study design is a randomized, community-based, participatory design to determine completion of a provider-recommended, take-home FIT kit without (control) and with social support (intervention) among a sample of average-risk, urban and rural Appalachian Latino adults age 50 and older not currently adherent to national CRC screening guidelines (N=264).Each consented participant will attend a one-time, community- based CRC screening educational program offered at one of the eight study sites located in Central PA. The proposal is innovative because it combines provider-recommended FIT screening test with an education program and social support for Latinos in a randomized, community-based participatory research design. Further, it will provide preliminary data for evidence-based methods to increase CRC screening rates among Latinos throughout Appalachia, the focus of a future NIH NC1 R-series grant application."
"9343345","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 100,000 babies are born very preterm (?32 weeks gestational age) every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop cognitive deficits and behavioral/psychiatric abnormalities. Unfortunately, these deficits and abnormalities cannot be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. These first few years are now recognized as critical for neuroplasticity, when proven infant stimulation programs could help to restore cognitive function. Our group has identified, in advanced MRI scans obtained at term corrected age (CA), multiple novel biomarkers that appear promising as early predictors of long-term cognitive deficits. Among these, the microstructural volume of diffuse white matter abnormalities (DWMA), as quantified using our novel automated software, is the most promising. We were the first to recognize an association between DWMA and neonatal inflammation-initiating illnesses. Yet, there remains continued debate about the pathological significance of DWMA. Our overall objective is to accurately quantify DWMA in order to elucidate its mechanism and effects on brain connectivity, and then to develop a robust prognostic model at term CA for early childhood cognitive deficits. We propose a large prospective cohort study in very preterm infants with MRI (structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI) at term CA and serial cognitive and behavioral assessments up to 3 years CA. Our central hypothesis is that DWMA is pathological and, when combined with early advanced MRI biomarkers, will accurately predict early childhood cognitive deficits. If confirmed, this would reduce the time to classify individual infans as high- or low-risk by up to 3 years, thus increasing the time available for targeted early intervention and novel neuroprotective therapeutic trials. The three specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: (1) Identify antecedent clinical risk factors for development of DWMA; (2) Determine the association between DWMA and structural and functional brain connectivity; and (3) Predict cognitive deficits using DWMA and advanced MRI biomarkers at term CA. Under the first aim, inflammation-initiating illnesses and other clinical risk factors will be associated wit DWMA. For the second aim, we will examine novel measures of structural and functional connectivity from diffusion MRI and resting state functional MRI and correlate them with DWMA microstructural volume at term CA. Under the third aim, we will combine DWMA with other promising biomarkers using multivariable regression models to robustly predict cognitive and behavioral development. This approach is innovative because it will integrate established epidemiologic principles with advances in neuroimaging, biomedical engineering, and neuropsychology to elucidate DWMA pathology and to develop early prognostic models of cognitive deficits in a large geographically defined population of very preterm infants. The proposed research is significant because it will reduce the time to diagnosis of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities by up to 3 years so that proven early intervention and bio- logically based therapies can be targeted to the highest risk infants, during a period of optimal neuroplasticity."
"9167420","PROJECT SUMMARY Many pathogens and diseased cells undergo dynamic changes in vivo but standard-of-care drugs are only designed to target the state of disease present at the time of diagnosis. Additionally, no cure exists for many emerging diseases. Several host-defense peptides from non-human origin have been identified to exert therapeutic response towards the microenvironment created by such cell-based malignancies. However, the challenge is to effectively deliver these therapeutic peptides to the disease cells without undergoing immune degradation and without causing toxicity to the normal cells. This can be achieved by the T cells because they can actively traffic to the disease sites through multiple solid tissues and identify the target cells with molecular specificity. These T cells can therefore be engineered for a broad range of effector functions following their interaction with antigens on their target cells. The investigator's long-term goal is to develop new treatments by targeting underlying molecular principles in disease pathology. The objective of this project, toward the long- term goal, is to develop the T cell into a broadly applicable drug synthesis vehicle that will actively seek out the disease microenvironments and autonomously synthesize non-human therapeutic peptides directly at the disease site. To achieve this objective, the investigator will test his central hypothesis that antigen-specific transmembrane chimeric antigen receptors can be engineered to control the T-cell-activation transcriptional machinery for self-assembly of non-human therapeutic peptides upon stimulation by the target cells. The foundation of this project rests upon the investigator's capability to upregulate the T-cell activation cascade and finding the compounds that suppress this activation. The feasibility of this plan is further supported by the well- studied biology of T cells and host-defense peptides of non-human origin. The rationale for this project is that it will break the status quo in passive delivery of static drugs and replace it with the one that actively searches for the disease and autonomously synthesizes complex biologic drugs in situ. The project is significant due to its broad applicability against the diseases that evade the immune function or involve it malfunction. While the investigator proposes to use dengue as a disease model, T cells can also be engineered to target other cell- based malignancies through their surface molecular antigens. The innovation lies in engineering different components of multiple pathways in the T cell so that it autonomously triggers the self-assembly of therapeutics in situ only when stimulated by its target disease microenvironment."
"9166797","It is now recognized that the gut microbiota ? the collection of microbes endemic to the normal human digestive tract ? plays a major role in regulating health, and adjusting the balance of the microbiota has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. However, no work has yet explored the possibility of engineering these endemic bacteria as safe and tunable vehicles for delivery of therapeutic functions to treat genetic disorders. I propose to test the feasibility of this approach by establishing a therapeutic strategy for a group of potentially lethal autosomal recessive disorders collectively called inborn errors in metabolism (IEMs), a group that includes diseases like Phenylketonuria (PKU), Tyrosinemia, and Maple Urine Disease (MSUD). Individually, most of these disorders affect just 1 or fewer in 10,000 newborns, but collectively, IEMs have an incidence rate of approximately 1 in 1,000. The pathologies of these disorders stem from improper metabolism of components present in food, particularly in breast milk, resulting in synthesis of toxic byproducts that can lead to severe developmental disorders in newborns. Death can result in cases where the disorder is not diagnosed early enough to implement appropriate interventions. Few attempts have been made to find treatments for these diseases and currently, the only intervention for most is a severely restricted diet, and that is often only partially effective. My lab is interested in using the tools of synthetic biology to develop a novel microbe-based therapeutic platform for treating IEMs. The amino acids that cause pathologies in IEMs are absorbed in the small intestine and then metabolized to produce toxic products. To minimize the toxicities, we propose to take advantage of microbes that naturally colonize the human small intestine and engineer them to produce enzymes that specifically intercept and metabolize the offending amino acids prior to absorption, generating non-toxic metabolites. We will develop a platform for this metabolic redirection using engineered enzymes expressed in bacteria that have also been engineered to maintain sufficient residence times in the gut to allow long-term therapeutic benefit. These bacteria will also be re-programmed for tunable metabolic re-direction and for population control that can be regulated using ingestible chemical signals. Such a strategy could provide much needed therapeutics for treating IEMs, and has strong potential as an approach to treating other types of metabolic disorders and gut infections as well."
"9236081","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to determine the role of cytoplasmic dynein in the establishment and maintenance of microtubule polarity patterns in the axon. The nearly uniform plus-end distal orientation of microtubules is a hallmark characteristic of axons and is highly conserved in neurons found throughout nature. This microtubule polarity is critical for neuronal function, as motor proteins that carry cargoes such as organelles and vesicles use microtubule polarity to guide their movement. Yet since its discovery in 1981, little progress has been made in elucidating the underlying mechanism responsible for generating and preserving the axonal microtubule array. Cytoplasmic dynein, a minus-end directed motor protein, is capable of transporting microtubules with their plus- ends leading. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dynein drives short microtubules into the axon with their plus-ends leading to build the microtubule array of the axon, but also drives minus-end distal microtubules out of the axon, to preserve fidelity of the axon's microtubule polarity pattern. Such  minus-end distal microtubules may arise during plastic events such as axonal branch formation, or as a result of disease or injury-related challenges. While the majority of microtubule transport  in the axon is anterograde, a notable fraction is retrograde, which is consistent with the existence of such a clearing mechanism. However, the role of cytoplasmic dynein has proven technically difficult to investigate because previous methods for inhibiting or depleting this moto protein did so gradually, thus introducing the potential for compensatory changes in the levels of other motor proteins. Additionally, traditional methods for visualizing microtubule transport were sub- optimal due to technical limitations. Here, the hypothesis will be tested through two specific  aims - the first aim will determine the effects on axonal microtubule polarity orientation of inhibiting cytoplasmic dynein; the second aim will test the hypothesis that cytoplasmic dynein clears minus-end distal microtubules from the axon by transporting them back to the cell body. Proposed studies on these two aims utilize primary cultures of rat sympathetic neurons for cell biological analyses using innovative live-cell imaging techniques and sophisticated inhibition strategies that allow acute, reversible inhibition of dynein. These strategies circumvent longstanding technical issues, allowing the hypothesis to be tested, while simultaneously creating a new gold standard for observing microtubule transport in living neurons. The notion of dynein-driven transport of microtubules as being responsible for the establishment and maintenance of microtubule polarity patterns in the axon has profound implications for the understanding of neuronal development and the progression and potential treatments of neurological diseases and injuries."

The most recent Strategic Plan specifically adds the goal to Enable better evidence-based decision making regarding CAM use and its integration into health care and health promotion and the strategic objective to Improve the capacity of the field to carry out rigorous research. Over the past fifteen years NCCAM has supported research into the efficacy of CAM/integrative medicine producing a rich source of evidence that can be used for clinical decisions. To better utilize this evidence CAM institutions need to improve the quality and quantity of research education for faculty and students. This was the focus of the NCCAM R25 grant program called the 'CAM Practitioner Research Education Project Grant Partnership', which was awarded to a small number of CAM institutions in partnership with research-intensive institutions. The program was specifically focused on evidence-based medicine (EBM) by enhancing understanding and appreciation of biomedical research. This initiative was very successful, and an opportunity for dissemination to other CAM institutions now exists. The goals of this K07 project are to develop evidence informed practice (EIP) for faculty development and in the acupuncture and oriental medicine (AOM) Master's program at Pacific College of Oriental Medicine (PCOM), the largest Oriental medicine college in the US. This project will leverage the two successive R25 grants that were awarded to Northwestern Health Sciences University (NWHSU), in collaboration with the University of Minnesota, which developed EIP curricula for faculty development and their CAM programs (including AOM). The candidate will be mentored by: experts in education research and integrative medical education at Albert Einstein College of Medicine (Einstein), the sponsoring institution; and the R25 co-principal investigator and lead EIP instructor at NWHSU. She will have access to all the NWHSU EIP materials and expertise and will spend four weeks at NWHSU. Coursework will be undertaken in education research at Einstein and Columbia University, and workshops in EBM and CAM research. The Specific Aims of the K07 project are: 1. To develop the education research skills of the candidate to become an independent researcher and expert in EIP education; 2. To develop EIP faculty training and curriculum by assessing, designing, developing, implementing and evaluating an EIP faculty development program and EIP curriculum within the AOM Master's program at PCOM-NY; and 3. To analyze the outcomes of the EIP curriculum, and impact on institutional culture. After the project the candidate will seek independent funding to implement EIP in all PCOM degree programs across its three campuses, and disseminate the materials and expertise to other colleges of Oriental medicine. This project will leverage NCCAM's R25 investment, and improve the capacity of the AOM profession to understand and use research in clinical practice."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Previously we developed, tested and disseminated a highly effective peer counseling program to reduce depressive symptoms in women with physical disabilities in partnership with Oregon Centers for Independent Living (CILs). Our academic-disability community partnership created Healing Pathways using community- based participatory research methods and we have sustained our partnership over 9 years. Healing Pathways is currently publicly funded and offered by four of the seven CILs in Oregon. The success of Healing Pathways is a direct result of community investment in and ownership of the program. We propose replicating this model to address depression in men with physical disabilities (MPDs). Depression is a common secondary condition in MPDs, occurring at rates between 37-64%. This is 2-3 times the rate of depression found in non-disabled men. MPDs with depression are at greater risk for decreased physical functioning, unemployment, social isolation, decreased life satisfaction, institutionalization, and death compared to men in the general population. To build on the success of Healing Pathways and to begin to address the serious problem of depressive symptoms in MPDs our academic disability community partnership proposes a community-engaged, exploratory sequential, mixed methods study to achieve the following three specific aims 1) Adapt the Healing Pathways program to meet the needs of MPDs with depressive symptoms; 2) Conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the peer program; and 3) Estimate the effect size of the peer program for depressive symptoms. The long-term goal of this program of research is to improve mental health outcomes in people with physical disabilities by partnering with members of this community. The outcomes of the proposed study will collectively inform the development of a future randomized controlled trial of the peer program designed to treat depressive symptoms in MPDs. The proposed study addresses several public health goals including Healthy People 2020 goal DH18 to reduce the proportion of people with disabilities who report serious emotional distress, and the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health goals 1-3, to understand that mental health is essential to overall health, promote mental health treatments that are consumer-driven, and eliminate disparities in mental health care."
"9145045","?Development of antidotes for toxic gases? The goal of this Program is to create a systematic process for developing antidotes against toxic gaseous chemicals by capitalizing on the proven track record of a team of physician-scientists backed by accomplished basic scientists. We will examine two acute pulmonary and cardiopulmonary toxidromes caused by the gaseous chemicals sharing common injury mechanisms: 1) alkylating agents, sulfur mustard (SM) and methyl isocyanate (MIC), that cause DNA crosslinking/damage, apoptosis, airway epithelial and endothelial injury, acute lung injury, and fibrosis, and 2) rapidly absorbed gases, methylmercaptan (CH3SH) and cyanide (HCN), that cause systemic mitochondrial failure. These toxic chemicals were chosen based on: 1) capacity to cause critical illness and death, 2) perceived threat(s), 3) recent and/or important past exposures, and 4) priorities of the NIH/CounterACT, BARDA, DoD, and international community. Therapies being advanced in Projects 1, 3, and 4 are intended as rescue countermeasures for mass casualty scenarios. Two of these (Projects 1 and 3) are intended to be for acute inhalation accidents or disasters. In Project 1, for MIC, three classes of therapies directed at receptor-mediated (TRP channel antagonist(s)), coagulation-related (plasminogen activator(s)), and biochemical (thiol compounds) events will be investigated in a new preclinical acute inhalation model. Therapies would be for immediate/delayed treatment, with intramuscular, airway, and enteral and/or intravenous delivery for TRP channel antagonists, plasminogen activators, and thiol compounds, respectively. In Project 2, the anti-fibrotic drugs pirfenidone and nintedanib will be evaluated via oral/airway delivery in a fibrotic chronic lung disease model in rats following sublethal SM exposure. In Project 3, the vitamin B12 analog cobinamide and sodium thiosulfate, both of which react directly with methyl mercaptan, will be tested as countermeasures against this acutely toxic gas in mice, rabbits, and pig models. In Project 4, a nanoparticle- associated cobinamide (Cbn) will be evaluated as acute rescue countermeasure for oral NaCN intoxication in rabbit and pig models. Because oral NaCN is absorbed as a gas (HCN) at the gastric mucosa, and since victims often will not be conscious, gastric lavage delivery will be used. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine potential of TRP channel antagonists, plasminogen activators, and thiols to decrease airway injury and lethality after MIC inhalation; 2) Define the efficacy of pirfenidone and other anti-fibrotic drugs against airway and parenchymal lung fibrosis after SM inhalation; 3) Establish efficacy of Cbn and thiosulfate for rescuing animals from lethal methylmercaptan exposures and 4) test the potential efficacy of nonabsorbable nano preparations of Cbn versus other Cbn preparations and routes in an oral NaCN poisoning and lethality model. Successful therapies from each project will be ready for advanced development and attain pre-IND status at or before the end of the cycle.  "
"9235385","Abstract  With the support of this K01, Dr. Amy Bei will pursue her career goal of conducting cutting-edge tropical diseases research in the United States and overseas, in close collaboration with resident scientists in malaria endemic countries. Dr. Bei's research focuses on applied international public health, and lies at the intersection between population genetics, genomics, epidemiology, molecular genetics, and immunology. She will use a translational systems biology approach to study the impact of antigenic diversity on immune evasion and vector transmission. The mentorship and training proposed here will facilitate her transition to an independent researcher, working towards the goal of an effective, diversity-transcendent vaccine for malaria.  As an established member of two scientific communities, Dr. Bei contributes to the activities of the Harvard Malaria Initiative at HTHCSPH and the Broad Institute, which provide the technical innovation and scientific resources needed to augment her growth as a scientist, and to those of the greater malaria research community of Dakar, Senegal, which is represented by the Institute Pasteur Dakar, University Cheikh Anta Diop, National Malaria Control Program, and PATH: MACEPA. While based at Le Dantec Hospital in the laboratories of Drs. Daouda Ndiaye and Souleymane Mboup, Dr. Bei has guided both malaria training and research activities for the past 5 years. Dr. Bei will assess the impact of genetic diversity on the development of immunity and dynamics of vector transmission in malaria endemic West Africa, while gaining expertise in the analytical tools needed to process complex genomic and transcriptomic data. She will conduct these studies under the expert guidance of U.S. mentor Dr. Dyann Wirth, Department Chair of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health, a leader in malaria biology with extensive experience in studying parasite genetics, elucidating mechanisms of drug resistance, and developing advanced genomic approaches; Senegal mentor Dr. Daouda Ndiaye, Chief of the Laboratory of Parasitology-Mycology at Le Dantec Hospital, a recognized leader in infectious diseases research on antimalarial drug resistance and malaria parasite diversity; co-mentor Dr. Carole Long, Chief of the Malaria Immunology Section, LMVR, NIAID, NIH and director of the Malaria Vaccine Reference Center; and co-mentor Dr. Rick Fairhurst, Chief of the Malaria Pathogenesis and Human Immunity Unit, LMVR, NIAID, NIH. Both co-mentors have extensive expertise in performing longitudinal cohort studies, standardizing immune and drug resistance assays, and evaluating malaria vaccines.  Antigenic diversity plays a major role in immune evasion, potentially compromising the development of natural or vaccine induced protective immunity. In Senegal, parasites with identical genotypes are found to increasingly infect multiple individuals in the population. This unique observation provides an unprecedented opportunity to test if individuals develop variant-specific immunity to the parasite genotypes to which they have been previously exposed. Alternatively or additionally, such persisting parasite genotypes may preferentially transmit to the mosquito vector or may be overrepresented in asymptomatic reservoirs. Such hypotheses can only be tested in a disease endemic setting in which patients can be monitored longitudinally, parasite genotypes can be tracked spatiotemporally in real-time, and robust correlates of immunity and transmission can be measured ex vivo. Dr. Bei will assess the effector function of naturally acquired IgG to specific parasite genotypes in growth inhibition assays (GIAs), variant surface antigen (VSA) recognition assays, and opsonophagocytosis assays, over time in a Senegalese longitudinal cohort, as well as the parasites' transmission potential for Anopheles mosquitoes. The proposed studies require the cohesion of cutting-edge genomic technologies, a well characterized longitudinal cohort to follow infection evolution and immunity development, standardized assays to serve as in vitro correlates of immune protection and transmission, and strong ties to endemic country scientists and institutions. Dr. Bei is uniquely positioned to combine these critical requirements to investigate the implications of parasite diversity on the development of protective immunity. Ultimately, this knowledge will be essential to developing a diversity-transcendent malaria vaccine."
"8998413","Project Summary  The Tumor Virology Program serves as the central forum for facilitating interactions among virologists involved  in cancer-related research, and investigators with an interest in the etiological basis of cancer. Program  members have broad expertise in the biology of tumor viruses, including EBV, KSHV, alpha and beta  herpesvirus, HPV, HCV, HIV and other retroviruses, as well as emerging viral agents including Merkel cell  polyoma viruses and other recently identified gamma-herpesviruses. The Program facilitates research in  thematic areas through highly interactive and productive affinity groups in Viral Oncogenesis, DNA Virology,  and Viral Receptors and Retrovirology. Since 2002, the Program has been led by Erle Robertson, PhD; in  2012, David Weiner, PhD, a pioneer in translational medicine and vaccine development, became Program Co-  Leader. Both Co-Leaders are experienced, well-funded and highly collaborative in their leadership and  research activities. During the project period, important strides have been made to further develop the  Program, which include fostering a stronger focus on translational research, developing new intra- and inter-  Programmatic collaborative efforts, recruiting additional tumor virologists, and better member engagement  through Program meetings as well as interdisciplinary, inter-Programmatic retreats. In doing so, the Tumor  Virology Program has nucleated interest among basic and clinical investigators in studying the roles of viruses  in cancer with collaborating members from the Tumor Biology, Immunobiology, Cancer Control, Cancer  Therapeutics, and Radiobiology and Imaging Programs. The major aims of the Program are to: 1) Understand  the mechanisms mediating cellular transformation, immortalization and cell cycle dysregulation by viral  encoded proteins; 2) Understand the viral-receptor interactions and the structure/function of viral receptors; 3)  Understand the molecular biology and pathogenesis of retroviruses as they relate to AIDS and AIDS-related  malignancies; 4) Develop viral vectors for human cancer gene therapy; and 5) Develop vaccine strategies for  treatment of viral-associated cancers. The Tumor Virology Program consists of 22 members from five  departments and two schools. Two new members have been added to the Program in the last five years,  increasing its breadth and strength. Program members have $10.2M in cancer-related grant funding (annual  direct costs), of which $6.9M is peer-reviewed and positioned to support cancer-related studies. $1.8M is  directly NCI-funded. During the project period, members published 176 cancer-related papers, of which 10%  were intra-Programmatic, 13% were inter-Programmatic and 51% were multi-institutional."
"9143551","Project Summary Some have proposed that SES inequalities in mortality can be explained by the influence of individual traits upon both later SES and mortality. This so-called ?indirect selection? model has far-reaching implications not only for social theory, but also for public policy. Vigorous debate exists over whether policies should treat health as a matter of personal responsibility dependent upon traits such as Conscientiousness and IQ, or as a matter of social responsibility dependent upon socioeconomic factors outside the individual's control. However, converging strands of theory suggest that the standard version of the indirect selection model may be overly simplistic in at least three respects. First, the ?brute luck? of socioeconomic circumstances at birth likely influences not only later SES, but also individual traits. The strength of this influence likely explains some of the apparent role personality and IQ seem to play in explaining associations between adulthood SES and earlier mortality. Second, key pathways in the indirect selection model likely vary across both gender and race/ethnicity. Institutional barriers may reduce the economic and health benefits of meritocratic traits among women, minorities, and those growing up within limited opportunity structures. Third, many argue that the measurement of IQ (and possibly personality) is systematically biased across social class and race. If true, the apparent role of traits in SES and race differences in mortality could be spuriously inflated or systematically distorted. We have carefully set the stage for a 55-year mortality follow-up of over 94,000 members of Project Talent--a national cohort sampled during high school in 1960, and again when they were on average 29-30 years old. The sample is unprecedented in combining national US scope with depth of psychological measurement. Detailed information exists on the childhood SES of participants, cognitive ability and personality in high school, and attained SES by age 29-30. We also leverage unique aspects of the cohort's historical context?Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty?in exploratory questions on static and changing local economic opportunity structure and institutionalized racial discrimination. Our mortality data-collection approximates the end of the natural life expectancy of the PT cohort (age 72-73), allowing us to focus on premature mortality--arguably, the most sensitive barometers of health inequalities. Our team features a mix of experts from personality and sociology (including the PT Survey Director), includes a minority health expert and historian, and is led by a PI who has focused on these issues for the past several years. Our project is thus poised to test and refine pivotal au currant conjectures about the role personality and IQ may play in social mortality inequalities."
"9195310","Project Summary Formation of complex neural circuits must be precisely controlled during the development of the nervous system. Axons navigate to their targets by detecting both long-range and short-range signals presented by cells in the environment that can act as attractants or repellants. Defects in axon guidance and targeting can result in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorders, and intelligence disabilities. The Drosophila visual system is an excellent model system for studying the basic mechanisms of axon guidance and neural circuit formation. The terminals of R7 and R8 photoreceptors, responsible for different aspects of color vision, are segregated into distinct target layers of the medulla, a central region of visual processing in the brain. Photoreceptors also must project in a retinotopic manner to maintain a precise representation of the visual field within the brain. In a screen for molecules that control color photoreceptor axon targeting, knocking down plexin A (plexA) in the brain using RNAi caused R7 photoreceptors to prematurely terminate in the R8 target layer of the medulla and fail to expand their axon terminals. A protein null mutation in plexA (plexAMb09499) caused by a Minos element insertion in a coding exon has the same effect on R7 axons. plexA is required in neurons, but not in photoreceptors, for R7 to reach the correct target layer. PlexA protein is expressed close to this target layer, suggesting that it may act as an attractive signal for R7 axons, in contrast to its known role in repelling L3 lamina neuron axons from this layer. Mosaic analysis will be used to confirm that this is the site of PlexA action. Overexpression of PlexA or a truncated form lacking the cytoplasmic domain in photoreceptors results in hyperfasciculation and premature termination of their axons. This misexpression phenotype will be used to characterize the mechanism of PlexA action and test the hypothesis that PlexA acts as an attractive or adhesive signal for photoreceptors. The known receptor and ligand for PlexA, Semaphorin- 1a, is not required for normal targeting of R7 photoreceptors. We will investigate whether PlexA instead interacts with an uncharacterized CUB domain protein, CG6024; knocking down CG6024 in photoreceptors using RNAi also disrupts R7 targeting. Homologs of PlexA have been studied in the organization of the vertebrate retina, and Plexin family members also participate in regulation of the immune response, heart and vessel formation, and even the progression of cancer. Preliminary results suggest that PlexA controls R7 targeting through a novel signaling mechanism, distinct from those previously described. Therefore, this work may provide new insight into the mechanisms that control a variety of developmental and disease processes in higher organisms."
"9255050","Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) and Prof. Edward Boyden?s Synthetic Neurobiology Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab propose to develop a new liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) capable generating high resolution holograms to overcome the ?imaging gap? that currently divides cellular-level optogenetic techniques and whole brain techniques to improve functional mapping/dissection of complex brain networks. This effort builds upon the successful Phase I effort, in which new modeling techniques were developed to guide this Phase II hardware development. Whole brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are powerful tools for visualizing neural activity and connections, respectively, across regions of the brain, however their spatial resolution is limited to the millimeter scale and therefore they cannot resolve individual neurons. Meanwhile, optical imaging and photostimulation provide complimentary tools that allow not only direct imaging of neurons and their action potentials, but also the ability to directly stimulate action potentials, all with single cell resolution over small sub-millimeter volumes. This disconnect between the length-scales of whole brain imaging and optical techniques, the so-called ?imaging gap?, is one of the critical barriers to understanding how coherent states arise from the activity of neuronal ensembles. In Phase I, BNS and MIT worked with Zemax, Inc. to develop a new optical modeling capability able to simulate holographic microscopy with pixelated phase-modulating SLMs. Using this new modeling capability, BNS identified the barriers to closing the imaging gap by holographically addressing a 1×1×0.5 mm3 volume of tissue. Specifically, we identified the need for a new SLM that optimally balances the trade-offs between addressable field of view, resolution, and switching speed and for corrective optics that undo the lateral chromatic dispersion experienced by the ultrashort laser pulses used for deep tissue microscopy. In Phase II, BNS will develop a next-generation SLM consisting of a 12 V 1280×1280 pixel backplane designed to achieve or exceed 1 ms switching speed. This device will be delivered via custom corrective optics into a commercial microscope at MIT for demonstration of holographic interrogation of neuronal ensembles over a 1×1×0.5 mm3 volume of tissue."
"9070962","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA modifications are ubiquitous in biology and present in all classes of cellular RNAs including eukaryotic messenger and long non-coding RNA. A large fraction of mammalian mRNA/lncRNA modifications are also known to be reversible, highly dynamic, and occur in cell type and cell state dependent manner. The dynamic RNA epitranscriptomes, those involving N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in particular, are known to regulate many cellular activities including mRNA splicing, export, cytoplasmic localization, stability, translation activity, microRNA processing, immune tolerance, and to impact cellular processes including proliferation, development, circadian rhythm, and embryonic stem cell differentiation. Consider m6A in mRNA/lncRNA as an example, dedicated writers, erasers, and readers exist in human cells to orchestrate an additional layer of complex post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. Emerging new functions of RNA modifications are expected to follow, with significant implications on many aspects of human health and disease. Despite high potentials and promises, current epitranscriptome studies are significantly hampered by the lack of technologies that enable quantitative mapping of any type of mRNA/lncRNA modifications at high resolution and high sensitivity. This proposal will develop new methods that target five abundant mRNA/lncRNA modifications, namely m6A, 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), pseudo uridine (?), and 2'O- methyls (Nm) for high-throughput sequencing at single-base resolution and suitable for low input RNA isolated from just hundreds to thousands of cells. New bioinformatics tools will be developed in order to facilitate data analysis. The general approaches proposed can be broadly applied to sequence RNA modifications in other RNA species including more abundant ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, snRNA, and snoRNA as well as miRNA and piRNA. We will apply the newly developed methods to obtain base-resolution maps of RNA modifications in order to associate with human diseases, and to proof-of-principle studies in neuro-biology. Our proposed research will establish high-throughput, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity methods for epitranscriptome research in all biological areas."
"9182311","DESCRIPTION: Wound healing is a complex process that follows a defined sequence of events consisting of inflammation, proliferation and migration of epithelial cells to re-epithelialize the wound, and remodeling/differentiation. The cationic antimicrobial protein of 37 kDa (CAP37) belongs to the innate immune system and was originally identified based on its powerful antimicrobial effect. It was later found to induce migration, adhesion and proliferation of cultured corneal epithelial cells, which translated into faster corneal re- epithelialization in vivo. Structure-function studies of CAP37 were initiated with the long-term goal to identify the antimicrobial and the wound healing domains of the protein to generate therapeutic peptides for clinical use. Our lab recently identified two CAP37-derived peptide analogs that carry a strong antimicrobial activity, even on antibiotic resistant or multiresistant strains, and a wound healing activity. These analogs have strong potential to be used as innovative ocular treatments with the dual effects of promoting corneal re- epithelialization and preventing or clearing bacterial infections. The molecular mechanisms mediating the wound healing effects of the full length CAP37 and the two derived analogs are unknown. The objective of this proposal is to identify the membrane and intracellular mediators activated by these extracellular ligands to induce migration of immortalized corneal epithelial cells and corneal re-epithelialization in mouse. Based on previous studies in our lab, we hypothesize that CAP37 and derived analogs act as extracellular ligands, binding a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) on corneal epithelial cells to activate intracellular signaling pathways, including the signal transduction proteins PKC? and PKC?, thus promoting wound healing effects. Two specific aims are proposed. (1) To identify the receptor(s) mediating the migration of human corneal epithelial cells and corneal wound healing in response to CAP37 ligands. (2) To identify the downstream signaling pathway(s) mediating corneal epithelial cell migration and corneal wound healing in response to CAP37 ligands. This new knowledge will break new grounds in this field of research because a receptor for CAP37 will be identified for the first time since its discovery 30 years ago. This new knowledge will also be key to developing and optimizing CAP37-derived peptide analogs into innovative therapeutics with the dual effects of killing resistant pathogens and promoting wound healing."
"9217373","This proposal addresses the need to improve health care quality through the implementation of patient centered outcomes research and by making health care safer. We do this by implementing a significant informatics based practice improvement process in the ambulatory setting, the use of automated online interpreting combined with asynchronous telepsychiatry consultations. There is a pressing national need to provide higher-quality, more effectively accessible language interpretation services to improve the health outcomes of the 4.7% of the US population who have limited English proficiency (LEP) and who currently, as a result, have increased rates of hospital admissions, misdiagnosis, improper treatment and poorer health comprehension and outcomes. This project addresses a critical component of this problem: the need to improve access to high quality, mental health services for diverse populations by improving the flow of clinical work across care settings (primary care and specialty care) through the use of online asynchronous methods of communicating. We have already created and demonstrated an efficient, provider compatible, administratively simple health IT solution: Asynchronous Telepsychiatry (ATP). In this study we will perform a clinical trial to demonstrate and validate a novel method of clinical language interpretation by using an automated online language interpreting tool we have developed with 100 Hispanic patients who have limited English proficiency (LEP). We will also compare this method for diagnostic accuracy, inter-rater reliability, patient satisfaction and language and syntax accuracy measures with the traditional in- person method of interpreting using a trained professional interpreter. This highly innovative proposal builds logically on our prior feasibility studies. The potential impact of this study is far-reaching if we find automated asynchronous language interpretation to be an improved, more easily accessible method of clinical interpretation that is acceptable to, or preferred by, LEP patients than current in- person approaches. The automated translation approach we are using has the potential to dramatically expand clinical capacity nationally and worldwide by reducing the need for on-site interpretation services. While we are testing and evaluating our approach with Spanish-speaking patients in the field of psychiatry, this technical approach can be generalized towards primary care and other medical disciplines and could be applied to many other languages, as well as beyond the healthcare field."
"9071072","Project Summary  This proposal is motivated by the principle that systematic analysis of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) metabolism  will produce biomarkers predicting oncological behavior and tumor-specific vulnerabilities against which to  direct novel therapies. RCC is diagnosed with increasing frequency in asymptomatic patients due to the  proliferation of cross-sectional imaging techniques. Although most small renal masses (SRMs) diagnosed in  this manner are indolent, there are no clear criteria by which to predict whether a given mass will behave  aggressively and require escalation of care. We propose to capitalize on altered RCC metabolism to identify  predictive biomarkers correlating with oncological behavior in SRMs undergoing active surveillance (AS), and  to identify a key set of reprogrammed metabolic activities whose function is required for aggressive RCC  growth. The rationale for the project is as follows: 1) most genes mutated in RCC regulate metabolism at the  cellular level; 2) metabolism is dynamic, quantifiable and responsive to many processes relevant to RCC  biology and disease progression; 3) many of these processes can be monitored non-invasively through  multiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMR) imaging; and 4) blockade of these metabolic activities should  prevent tumor progression. We therefore hypothesize that rigorous metabolomics and imaging can be used to  identify quantitative features that predict tumor aggressiveness in SRMs, and that can be inhibited to suppress  the growth of aggressive RCC. We will pursue three aims to test this hypothesis, each featuring an integrated,  innovative array of techniques developed by the outstanding group of investigators involved in this Project.  Aims 1 and 2 will feature a prospective, observational study of 160 patients on AS for incidentally diagnosed  SRMs. This cohort will be monitored longitudinally by mpMRI (Aim 1) and by metabolomics in the renal mass  and urine (Aim 2). Patients who progress to surgical intervention because of accelerating tumor growth rates  will have imaging and metabolomics repeated at the time of nephrectomy, and a subset of patients will receive  intra-operative infusion of isotope-labeled nutrients to assess tumor metabolic flux in vivo (Aim 2). Data from  the cohort will be analyzed to identify metabolomic and imaging features correlating with oncological  aggression. In Aim 3, we will use metabolomics, metabolic flux analysis and multi-modality imaging (PET, MR)  to identify metabolic features of aggressive RCC growth in a set of genetically and histologically diverse  orthotopic RCC tumors in mice. Enzymes from key pathways differentiating tumor from normal kidney will be  inhibited to determine the effect on tumor growth. Altogether, work in this Project will produce a comprehensive  and dynamic view of reprogrammed metabolism in human RCC and will identify new metabolic candidates for  targeted therapy. A key, unique deliverable, satisfying an important unmet clinical need in kidney cancer  management, will be the discovery of a set of biomarkers with the potential to guide AS in patients with  incidentally diagnosed SRMs."

"9269016","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research program is to optimize three-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM) for large scale, noninvasive, volumetric imaging of neuronal activity. To leverage the superb performance of green-fluorescent protein based genetically engineered Ca-probes (e.g., GCaMPs), 3PM at the 1300-nm spectral window will be developed, which not only preserves the tissue penetration capability of 3PM at the longer excitation wavelength but also enables a wide variety of blue and green fluorophores, including a number of fluorescent proteins and Ca-indicators, to be excitable via three-photon excitation. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) so that a practical frame rate can be achieved for imaging dynamic brain activity even at a penetration depth of 1.1 mm or beyond, new objective lenses will be designed and fabricated that will collect the signal efficiently at depth. In additin, the lens design will also support convenient integration with adaptive optics (AO), with the goal of making AO a routine imaging tool in a neuroscience lab. To improve both SNR and spatial resolution, AO in 3PM at 1300 nm will be employed. The impact of AO for increasing signal generation is significantly higher for 3PM than 2PM because of the higher order nonlinear process. The impact of AO is also expected to increase with increasing imaging depth. The aim is to achieve close to diffraction limited spatial resolution for 3PM at 1300 nm, which will be sufficient to resolve individual dendrite. A strong interdisciplinary research team has been assembled, including participants from both industry and academia, to perform the research and development. The successful completion of this program will have a broad impact on neuroscience where high-resolution, high speed imaging deep within an intact mouse brain is required."

"9237741","PROJECT SUMMARY Surgical spending accounts for 30% of national health spending and is growing more rapidly than spending in other key healthcare sectors. Many hope that payment reforms included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will help curtail such spending growth. Chief among these reforms were provisions for establishing accountable care organizations (ACOs). By encouraging deeper health system integration and greater financial stewardship, proponents believe that ACOs will enhance care coordination and reduce the use of unnecessary services, ultimately improving quality and lowering health spending. However, the net effects of ACOs on surgical care remain unclear. On the one hand, ACOs incentives may motivate clinicians to consider cheaper alternatives to surgery in pursuit of lower population expenditures. On the other hand, shared saving agreements could have unintended consequences. For example primary care providers (PCPs) with ACO contracts may place too much emphasis on surgeons' costs, ignoring their quality, when making referral decisions. Moreover, economic pressures may lead surgeons, who rely on ACO PCPs for a steady stream of patients, to withhold costly but valuable care. In addition, important contextual factors may moderate ACO effects. For instance, ACOs frequently do not encompass surgeon practices and ambulatory surgery centers, where a growing share of surgical care is delivered. If these surgical providers are weakly connected to the PCP groups accepting collective accountability, ACOs' influence on them may be attenuated. In this context, we propose a study to better understand the impact that ACOs have on surgical care. Our proposal has the following three Specific Aims. To determine the impact that ACOs have on surgical spending and quality. Using the national Medicare population, we will identify eligible beneficiaries aligned with a Medicare ACO and those that are not. We will then compare surgical and overall expenditures among these beneficiaries before and after ACO formation. For beneficiaries who undergo surgery, we will also assess their perioperative outcomes and total episode payments. Aim 2: To evaluate for clinical heterogeneity in ACO effects on surgical care delivery. We will identify subsets of Medicare beneficiaries from Aim 1 with one of six conditions for which surgery is considered a treatment. We will then evaluate for differences in surgical spending on higher, intermediate, and lower value surgical procedures among these beneficiaries before and after ACO formation. Aim 3: To assess how heterogeneity in policy implementation affects surgical care delivery. Using linked data from the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations and network analytical tools, we will assess how financial risk and organizational structure (including surgeon participation) moderate ACO effectiveness.

"9260448","Reduced ?-cell mass and increased ?-cell apoptosis are key to the pathophysiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, identifying factors that can protect from ?-cell apoptosis will meet a critical thera- peutic need in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cholecystokinin (CCK) are peptide hormones normally produced in the intestine with beneficial effects on ?-cell mass and func- tion. Both GLP-1 and CCK are produced within the pancreatic islet under conditions of islet stress. GLP-1 based therapies are in widespread use for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and there is substantial evidence in cell lines and rodent models that GLP-1 can protect from ?-cell apoptosis. Similarly, we have shown that CCK is necessary and sufficient to protect from ?-cell apoptosis in mouse models. While CCK has been widely studied in exocrine pancreatic cells, there is limited information about the role of CCK in the ?-cell. We propose that the production of these hormones in the islet represents a compensatory physiologic mechanism to pro- mote ?-cell survival. The long-term goal is to identify novel pathways critical in the preservation of ?-cell mass. The overall objective of this application is to determine the regulation of locally produced GLP-1 and CCK and their role in protection from ?-cell apoptosis. The central hypothesis is that an intra-islet signaling network ex- ists, whereby GLP-1 produced in the ?-cell and CCK produced in the ?-cell are co-regulated and work together to promote ?-cell survival. To achieve the objective, three Specific Aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will deter- mine how GLP-1 and CCK production are regulated in the pancreatic islet. Preliminary evidence support the hypothesis that CCK and GLP-1 signal in a paracrine manner within the islet to co-regulate one another. We will use transgenic overexpression of ?-cell CCK and receptor knockout mouse models to clarify how these hormones regulate one another in the islet. In Aim 2, we will identify the mechanism of CCK-mediated protec- tion from cytokine-induced apoptosis. We will use receptor antagonists and knockouts to determine which CCK receptor regulates ?-cell survival and we will determine the intracellular signaling pathways activated by CCK in the ?-cell. In Aim 3, we will determine if GLP-1 and CCK can synergistically and interdependently protect human islets from apoptosis. We have intriguing evidence that the role of GLP-1 in ?-cell survival is dependent on CCK receptor signaling in a cell line. This suggests the innovative concept that the impact of GLP-1 on the ?-cell relies on its ability to stimulate CCK. As human islets have very different characteristics than mouse islet, examining the role of GLP-1 and CCK specifically in human islets is of critical importance to translation of our findings to diabetes therapies. These studies will contribute to our fundamental understanding of this novel in- tra-islet hormonal regulatory pathway and the mechanisms whereby GLP-1 and CCK promote ?-cell survival. This contribution is significant as it will advance knowledge of both adaptive and therapeutic mechanisms of ?- cell survival, allowing development of targeted therapies with maximal efficacy and minimal side effects."
"9190649","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Preterm birth represents a significant health burden worldwide, with particularly significant impact in the developing world. Influenza infection during pregnancy raises the risk of preterm birth four-fold, though the mechanism behind this remains mysterious. Recently, our laboratory showed that in vitro influenza infection elicits a more robust immune response in pregnant women than non-pregnant women, overturning the prevailing view that pregnancy is a generally immunosuppressed state. Upon examination of publicly available data, we also found that healthy pregnant women have a transcriptional signature consistent with acute influenza infection. These findings led to the central hypothesis that preterm birth is driven by excessive elevation of inflammatory pathways that are normally elevated during pregnancy, and that the magnitude of the response to influenza will predict the risk of preterm birth. However, no data yet exists on the intersection between preterm birth and influenza-associated inflammatory pathways, providing a rationale for the approach of performing perform holistic deep immune profiling on samples collected during pregnancy from Kenyan women who subsequently delivered preterm or at term. I will pursue my central hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) Defining how the cellular immune response to influenza during pregnancy differs between women who later deliver at term versus preterm, and 2) Identifying the transcriptional response to influenza in pregnant women who subsequently deliver at term or preterm. Under the first aim, a novel mass cytometry panel developed by the Blish lab will be used to study the cell subsets and immune functions at baseline and in response to in vitro influenza infection. This highly dimensional data will be analyzed manually and by unsupervised clustering algorithms that have successfully identified clinically relevant cell populations. Under the second aim, transcriptional arrays will be used to measure the levels of 6 million human gene transcripts, exon clusters and splice variants. This data will be used to identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed following in vitro influenza infection. This approach is innovative as it represents the first use of comprehensive immune profiling on a pregnancy cohort with known birth outcomes in a developing country. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to shed new light on the underlying pathogenesis of preterm birth, as well as point the way toward promising therapeutic targets. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential shape the way pregnant women are assessed for preterm birth risk and provide therapeutic options for high-risk pregnancies."
"9129628","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are sexually transmitted and linked to the development of oropharyngeal and anogenital malignancies, including cervical cancer, of which it is the etiological agent. HPV infects the basal layer of epithelium where it establishes its genome as episomes at low copy numbers. Upon cellular differentiation, the virus amplifies its genomes to thousands of copies per cell and completes its viral life cycle. While prophylactic vaccines are available to prevent infection, there is no cure or existing HPV infections, so uncovering the mechanisms regulating its replication in differentiating epithelia is critical for the development of anti-viral therapies and the restrictin of HPV-associated carcinomas. HPV activates the ATM (ataxia- telangiectasia mutated) DNA damage response (DDR) pathway for viral genome amplification upon differentiation; however, the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway, which is activated by ATM, was reported to limit viral replication in differentiated cells. Additionally, a predisposition for HPV-associated cancers was reported in FA patients, who have a mutation in one or more of genes involved in the FA pathway, suggesting that this pathway lessens the oncogenic potential of the virus. Preliminary experiments reveal that one of the pathway's key regulatory proteins, FANCD2, directly binds the viral genome and colocalizes with ATM pathway components during viral infection. Additionally, the knockdown of FANCD2 disrupts the maintenance of viral episomes in undifferentiated cells, suggesting a more complex role for the FA pathway in regulating HPV replication. This research proposal aims to define the role of the FA pathway in the differentiation-dependent life cycle of HPV and examine the mechanism behind the increased susceptibility to HPV-associated malignancies seen in FA patients. To identify the role of the FA pathway in HPV infection, shRNA knockdown and site-directed mutagenesis of FANCD2 will be used to determine its impact on viral genome maintenance and amplification. The proposal also will investigate mechanisms through which the virus modulates the FA pathway for completion of its life cycle. This will be accomplished by assessing the expression and activation of FA pathway components in the presence of wild-type or mutated viral proteins. Lastly, an analysis of the long- term effects of an FA deficiency on viral transformation will be performed through the use of in vitro tumorigenicity assays. Results from this study will provide insight into the mechanism through which the FA pathway regulates HPV viral infection and a better understanding of the relationship between HPV and host DDR pathways during viral infection and transformation."
"9196706","Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and hypocretin/orexin (HCRT)-expressing neurons are intermingled populations in the tuberal hypothalamus that project widely throughout the brain to many of the same terminal fields. Whereas the HCRT system has been implicated in the control of wakefulness because the sleep disorder narcolepsy results when these cells degenerate, this system is also involved in energy metabolism. Conversely, the MCH system has primarily been associated with food intake and energy metabolism, but recent studies have established that MCH neurons also participate in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the HCRT system is wake-stabilizing and REM-inhibiting whereas the MCH system is sleep-facilitating and REM-stabilizing. We will test this hypothesis by determining the phenotype of mice in which either the HCRT or MCH neurons have been partially ablated by removal of doxycycline in the diet of two conditional mouse models. We will then evaluate whether partial ablation of the HCRT neurons results in a phenotype of narcolepsy without cataplexy and whether cataplexy is exacerbated by simultaneously eliminating both neuronal populations. We will also assess whether direct connectivity exists between these cell groups using optogenetically-assisted neuroanatomical tracing and whole-cell patch- clamp electrophysiology in the presence and absence of selective HCRT and MCH receptor antagonists. To assess what occurs in the brain when the HCRT neurons degenerate as in human narcolepsy, we will use the conditional HCRT neuron ablation model to determine how the excitability of the MCH population is affected by chronic loss of HCRT input. We will also use conditional MCH neuron ablation to assess the converse effect of MCH loss on HCRT neuron excitability. Based on recordings from a limited number of cells in head-fixed animals, the HCRT and MCH neurons have been reported to have reciprocal activity across the sleep-wake cycle with HCRT neurons having their highest firing rates during active wakefulness and MCH neurons being primarily active during REM sleep. To determine the accuracy of this conclusion, we will use genetically- encoded Ca2+ indicators and microendoscopic imaging to measure the activity of hundreds of HCRT and MCH neurons across the sleep/wake cycle in unrestrained, freely-moving animals. To evaluate whether the HCRT and MCH neurons are functionally interconnected, we will pharmacogenetically activate one population while imaging Ca2+ fluorescence in the other population in the presence of selective HCRT and MCH receptor antagonists. Lastly, since these two populations project to many of the same brain regions, we will assess their relative input to brain areas known to be involved in arousal state control, specifically, the locus coeruleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, medial septum, and the amygdala. Together, these experiments should provide a more complete picture of the anatomical and functional connectivity of these two populations and the consequences of selective loss of one population or the other."
"9214494","ABSTRACT Despite recent progress in reducing the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 722,000 HAIs occurred in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, resulting in 75,000 deaths. Current methods for detecting outbreaks in hospitals are rudimentary and likely to miss some outbreaks altogether and result in substantial delays in detection of others. There are two major developments in healthcare that have the potential to revolutionize how healthcare associated outbreaks of bacterial pathogens are identified and controlled in hospitals. First, the Affordable Care Act mandates use of the electronic medical record (EMR), which has led to its widespread use in healthcare. Second, the costs of bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) have declined substantially, which is making its use by infection programs increasingly feasible. In this application, we propose to establish and evaluate the impact of the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare Association Transmission (EDS-HAT) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). EDS-HAT uses a combination of WGS and analysis of the EMR for enhanced outbreak detection. Our specific aims are to 1a): Determine the utility of EDS-HAT to identify HAT that is not identified through routine infection prevention practice, 1b): Improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using the EMR to restrict the use of WGS, 2a): Measure reductions in HAIs following implementation of EDS-HAT, and 2b): Estimate the number of infections and deaths prevented and healthcare costs averted by EDS-HAT. For Aim 1a, EDS-HAT will be performed retrospectively while routine infection prevention practice (requests for molecular typing when an outbreak is suspected) continues, thus allowing a direct comparison of the two approaches. For Aim 1b, we will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of EDS-HAT by using machine learning and data mining of the EMR to select isolates for WGS. For Aim 2a, we will monitor changes in HAI rates both before and after implementation of EDS-HAT in real time, which will occur at the beginning of year 3. Finally, for Aim 2b, we will perform clinical and budget impact analyses to determine the overall impact of EDS-HAT. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a team with expertise in infectious diseases, outbreak investigation, infection prevention, microbial genomics and genomic epidemiology, machine learning and data mining, economic analysis and modeling, epidemiology, and biostatistics. EDS-HAT will likely lead to substantial reductions in infections, deaths, and healthcare costs and can serve as a model for how HAT is detected in hospitals."

"9128134","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared to whites. Racial disparities are most profound among persons of low socioeconomic status (SES) and dietary factors likely underlie much of this disparity. Low SES AAs are more likely to experience food insecurity and live in food deserts and are less likely to follow a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) accordant diet than are whites. This is despite evidence that adherence to the DASH diet may have greater blood pressure benefit for AAs than whites, and evidence that the DASH diet may slow CKD progression (including reductions in urine albumin excretion). We propose to build upon encouraging results of our pilot study, The Five-Plus Nuts and Beans Trial, which was conducted as a partnership between Johns Hopkins investigators, a community supermarket, the Baltimore City Health Department's Virtual Supermarket program, a community-based clinic and a highly engaged Community Advisory Board. This randomized trial tested the effects of a dietary approach to increase consumption of a central feature of the DASH diet--high potassium foods. A total of 123 AA patients with controlled hypertension, and recruited from a community-based clinic, were provided personalized dietary advice, assistance with grocery ordering and delivery, and $30 per week worth of high potassium foods for an 8-week period. With this approach, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in consumption of fruits, vegetables, potassium, magnesium and fiber, and decreases in sodium intake. Also, there was a 14% reduction in urinary albumin excretion overall, and a 30% reduction among patients with significant albuminuria at enrollment. In this application, we propose a larger (n=150) and longer (1 year) trial of a dietary intervention in AAs  with hypertension (controlled or uncontrolled) plus mild/moderate CKD-a population at very high risk of the adverse effects of poor diets. The primary aim, in the setting of a randomized trial, is to test the hypothesis that delivery of nutritional advice to adopt the DASH diet and $30  per week worth of potassium-rich foods, tailored to personal choices and availability in neighborhood stores of patients recruited from community-based clinics, will reduce blood pressure and reduce urinary albumin excretion in low SES AAs with hypertension and CKD. Strengths of our proposal include the integration of an experienced, highly collaborative team of investigators with expertise in clinical trials, nephrology, health disparities, community-based participatory research, integration of trials into primary care practices, and statistical analyses The investigation team includes a highly involved Community Advisory Board, and has an established close partnership with Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, the Baltimore City Health Department and local supermarkets. If our hypothesis is correct, then our trial will establish an immediately translatable, inexpensive, and safe approach for adjuvant therapy in the treatment of hypertension and kidney damage (albuminuria) among low SES AAs."
"9254120","Miya Model? Simulator: Phase II Abstract OB/GYN Residents must develop numerous skills including pelvic exams, child birth, open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and vaginal surgery. Studies demonstrate that OB/GYN Residents lack training in vaginal surgical techniques, including Vaginal Hysterectomy (VH). Vaginal Hysterectomy is the desired technique recommended by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) because it is associated with less morbidity, quicker recovery and lower costs than abdominal hysterectomy. Furthermore, Residents do not receive adequate training in vaginal surgery techniques used to treat incontinence, urinary or fecal, or pelvic organ prolapse. The Miya Model? is a complete female pelvic anatomy model designed to simulate real surgical experiences using lifelike skin and life-sized organs, realistic cutting and puncturing tensions, palpable surgical landmarks, a pressurized vascular system that bleeds when inadequate technique is used, and an inflatable bladder that can leak water if damaged. The model is modular in design and all of the parts are easily replaceable when used in a simulated surgery. The anatomical correctness of the model can be used to train a broad range of health professionals on general procedures like bimanual exam, speculum exam and pap smear, as well as advanced gynecologic vaginal surgeries. There is no commercially available simulator that can train vaginal surgical skills and basic gynecological procedures to a breadth of health professionals other than the Miya Model?. The successfully completed specific aims of the Phase I SBIR showed significant progress. Phase I work developed a curriculum for doing VH and created a production design making the Miya Model? and its replacement cartridges more affordable while modifying the design based on surgeon feedback. In Phase I the Miya Model? demonstrated Construct Validity in that performance differences of novices and experts performing a VH on the model were measurable. Construct Validity is a crucial step in simulator's acceptance as a training device. Phase II will encompass seven Specific Aims with the goal of preparing the Miya Model? and its associated curriculum and scoring metrics for wide spread adoption in OB/GYN training. To reach this goal, the objectives of Phase II are to finalize the production design and tooling of the model and replacement cartridges for mass production so that it is affordable for many training programs. The Curriculum for VH developed in Phase I, along with a curriculum for performing a Transobturator sling procedure on the Miya Model? will be converted to tablet ?Apps.? Finally, a scoring system based on objective metrics that are easy to measure will be developed and validated. When complete, the Miya Model? will be used in OB/GYN residency programs to train vaginal surgery techniques and objectively assess surgical competency without any risk or harm to patients. It will also be used in numerous and diverse residency, nursing and allied health educational programs for basic gynecology training. It will also be used by hospitals for credentialing and medical device companies for product development and training."
"9245394","PROJECT SUMMARY Mutations in the serine/threonine kinase Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-Like 5 (CDKL5) are strongly implicated in infantile epileptic encephalopathy (IEE), yet at present only a few substrates have been identified, and the mechanisms behind CDKL5 mutation in disease etiology remains largely unknown. Until these knowledge gaps are addressed, it is likely that the field will struggle to understand, and have difficulty treating, CDKL5- associated IEE. The long-term goal is to understand the fundamental mechanisms behind infantile epileptic encephalopathy, in order to develop new, effective therapeutic strategies. This requires a precise understanding of the role(s) of CDKL5 in both normal brain development and IEE. The objective in this application, therefore, is to identify the substrate specificity of wild-type and mutant CDKL5, and to create publically accessible CDKL5 substrate predictors. The central hypothesis is that IEE-associated CDKL5 mutations will rewire kinase substrate specificity, resulting in distinct substrate pools for individual CDKL5 variants. This hypothesis has been formulated based on preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that characterizing the substrate specificity of wild-type and IEE- associated CDKL5 mutants, and creating freely available tools that use this data to identify high-confidence putative substrates, will allow the field to advance the understanding of CDKL5-associated encephalopathy. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested through the first of two specific aims: 1) Identify the wild-type and encephalopathy-associated mutant substrate specificities of the CDKL5 kinase; the critical need for accessible prediction tools will be addressed in the second specific aim: 2) Create freely accessible, custom substrate predictors for each CDKL5 variant. The first aim will be conducted using a novel bacterial approach for determining protein kinase specificity, while the second aim will be accomplished by a companion computational tool for substrate prediction; both the bacterial approach and computational tool were pioneered by the applicant's group. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it combines their lab's approach for specificity determination with powerful computational tools, and represents a significant departure from the status quo by shifting the focus of CDKL5 disease etiology to substrate specificity rewiring. The research will be significant because it is expected to offer critical insight into the etiology of CDKL5-associated IEE. Ultimately, this insight has the potential to guide the treatment of IEE, and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT All three Partnering institutions, Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC), have established Administrative Cores. As part of the currently active U54, at each of the three institutions, an efficient administrative infrastructure is in place. The primary objectives of this core are for coordination, communication, budgetary oversight, and clerical functions associated with the overall research program proposed in this grant application. The Partnership has four Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Planning & Evaluation, and Research Education), Research Projects (two Full Projects and a Pilot Project), and two Shared Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). The Partnership Administrative Core, which is responsible for administrative management of Partnership-wide activities, is comprised of the institution-specific Executive Committees (ECs), the Partnership Leadership Committee (PLC), the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The ECs, consisting of all institution-specific Principal Investigators (PIs) (Lead, Co-PIs, and Co-Leaders of all cores and shared resources) meet once a month and are responsible for the day-to-day oversight at each institution. The PLC, consisting of the leaders and co-leaders of all three institutions, as in the past, will have a monthly tele-conference and will be responsible for internal planning, execution, and assessment of the Partnership activities. The IAC, consisting of six leaders (two from each Partnering institution), reviews, twice a year, the Partnership?s progress and decisions and provides guidance to the overall Partnership. The PSC, consisting of seven external members, whose expertise covers all areas of the proposed research programs, and an NCI-official as an ex-officio member, functions as the external review body, which annually evaluates all components of the Partnership?s progress and provides guidance. Further, a Scientific Review Committee, consisting of all PIs and a science editor, solicits pilot projects that will be funded in years 4 and 5 of the funding cycle, and assigns to external reviewers to assess their scientific merit and for funding after obtaining approvals from PSC. The expertise of the PIs of all three institutions is complementary to each other, and most of these leaders have been successfully working together for more than 10 years. The Program Managers, together with Administrative/Finance Officers of the respective institutions, aid the Partnership by providing day-to-day administrative support, coordination, preparation of the annual progress reports, and logistical services needed to accomplish the Partnership functions. Additionally, the Presidents and PIs of all three institutions will continue to conduct yearly joint video conferences to discuss progress of the Partnership and to reaffirm their continued commitment to strengthen, integrate, and expand Partnership activities."
"9247541","Project Summary/Abstract Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive, metastatic, nerve-associated tumors that occur sporadically (~50% of cases) or in association with the inherited syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and a leading cause of death in neurofibromatosis patients. Despite current aggressive multimodal therapy, MPNST patients have a poor prognosis with high rates of tumor relapse and severe treatment-related side effects. There is currently no effective chemotherapeutic regimen for MPNSTs. This presents an urgent need to identify and develop alternative targeted therapies. Thus, identifying and targeting key regulatory pathways that are vital to MPNST formation are essential to overcoming this challenge.  The objective of this application is to investigate the function of a novel signaling pathway, the Hippo pathway in peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis or MPNSTs that are not associated with NF1 mutations. The Hippo signaling pathway plays an important role in the control of cell growth, homeostasis, and tumorigenesis in various organ systems. Our preliminary studies show that loss of Lats1/2 kinases, Hippo signaling components, in the Schwann cell lineage leads to high grade GEM (Genetically Engineered Mouse)-PNST formation with full penetrance. Thus, our central hypothesis, based on our strong preliminary data, is that Lats1/2 functions as a novel tumor suppressor in MPNSTs, which has not been characterized previously in MPNSTs. We hypothesize that Lats1/2 and Lats- mediated downstream signaling events are essential for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumorigenesis. This novel mouse model system for GEM-PNST initiation and growth will provide a unique opportunity to dissect the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in regulating MPNST formation. The proposed study will: 1) define the susceptible stages in the SC lineage for GEM-PNST initiation and progression due to Hippo signaling inactivation; 2) identify the critical pathways and signals that drive tumorigenesis in Lats1/2-deficient mice. 3) test the hypothesis that Hippo signaling effectors Yap and Taz are required for Lats1/2-mutant induced tumor formation. The long-term objective of our proposed studies is to develop therapeutic strategies for MPNST treatment by defining the function of Hippo signaling in the initiation and progression of MPNSTs and identifying the critical mediators of Lats1/2 in tumorigenesis. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Ultimately, these studies will establish a proof-of- principle for preclinical studies and develop effective therapies against tumor formation and progression in the patients with MPNSTs."
"9143769","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is considered the most devastating neurodegenerative disease. Patients suffer progressive functional loss, including loss of speech, swallowing, mobility, and respiration that leads to death on average 2 to 4 years after diagnosis. Except for aggressive symptomatic care, there are no effective treatments. More than 50 clinical trials based on plausible hypotheses of disease mechanisms have failed except for riluzole. Identified inherited pathogenic mutations account for ~10% of all ALS cases; the cause of most sporadic cases is unknown. ALS is now considered to be potentially caused by a combination of both genetic and environmental risk factors. Our overall hypothesis is that individual environmental risk factors reported to be associated with ALS act via a common mechanism, specifically oxidative stress (OS). Our NIEHS-funded prospective multicenter cohort study of ALS (ALS COSMOS), which investigates the extent to which multiple risk factors associated with OS are also associated with ALS progression, is in its final stages. Our current ARREST ALS project expands ALS COSMOS at a national level through the National ALS Registry, using structured telephone interviews and one-time urine and saliva collection. Now, we propose a set of well-designed, high-quality, case-control studies nested within ARREST ALS. We specifically aim: 1. To evaluate environmental and other risk factors in a population-based case-control study nested within the ARREST ALS study of the National ALS Registry. The cases (150 patients) will be identified in the on- going ARREST ALS project. We will match 2 controls to each case based on sex, age (± 5 years), race/ethnicity, and geographic area of residence. We will administer our well-validated, structured interview to determine cognitive function and obtain data on early life events and environmental, residential, occupational, dietary, lifestyle, and psychological factors. Dietary questionnaire data, first-void urine samples to measure OS markers, and saliva DNA will be collected; 2. To evaluate early life and late life environmental and other risk factors in a sibling-based, case-control study. We will identify a same-sex sibling who agrees to participate and is closest in age to the case. We estimate that 80% of cases will have a sibling who meets these criteria. They will receive the same risk factor assessment and provide saliva and urine samples as the population controls. 3. To evaluate individual or aggregate environmental risk factors between cases and controls at different stages of life and to investigate the significance of the urinary OS biomarker in relation to ALS and environmental risk factors. We will analyze risk factors at different stages of life in the two control groups combined in comparison to the cases and further analyze OS biomarkers in relation to risk factors. In summary, carefully designed population-based and sibling-based case-control studies nested within ARREST ALS will reveal entirely new and unique data concerning environmental risk factors, disease progression, and the potential cause(s) of ALS."

To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life."
"9074410","ABSTRACT  The RAS family of genes, comprised of KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS, are mutated in upwards of a third of  all human cancers, yielding proteins that remain in a constitutively active, oncogenic state that are well  established to cause this disease. The proteins encoded by these three genes are nearly identical,  activated by and signal through the same proteins, and capable of causing cancer in mice. Despite this  uniformity, KRAS is the most commonly mutated of the three, and the type of mutations in KRAS, as well  as the other RAS genes, varies extensively in human cancers. To understand these phenomena, we  compared the nucleotide sequence of the RAS genes, finding that KRAS has many rare codons that limit  protein expression, HRAS has many common codons that foster protein expression, while NRAS has a  mixture of rare and common codons and intermediate protein expression. Focusing on KRAS, the most  commonly mutated RAS gene, we show that introducing silent mutations to convert rare codons to  common in one exon of this gene reduced both the number of lung tumors and the mutations detected in  Kras of mice exposed to a carcinogen. To determine the mechanism responsible for this result, in aim 1  we will activate an inducible oncogenic Kras gene with common codons in the lungs of mice to identify  the stage of tumorigenesis sensitive to perturbing the inherent rare codon bias of Kras. Once identified,  we will then hone in on the cellular feature changed, and in turn, the molecular response underlying this  effect. Converting rare codons to common also altered the type of oncogenic mutations recovered in  Kras after carcinogen exposure. To determine the underlying mechanism, in aim 2 we will similarly  engineer mice with an inducible Kras gene encoded by common versus native codons with different  oncogenic mutations. As above, these Kras alleles will be activated in the lungs of mice to determine  how different oncogenic mutations in the backdrop of altered codon usage impacts tumorigenesis, tumor  cell characteristics, and cellular signaling. Completion of these two aims will elucidate the mechanism by  which codon bias influences the frequency and type of mutations arising in Kras during tumorigenesis.  Despite the advantage afforded to Kras by rare codons in early tumorigenesis, we show that established  cancer cells overcome the poor translation of Kras mRNA imposed by rare codons to increase Kras  protein expression, which was linked to increased tumorigenic activity and resistance to  chemotherapeutics. To identify how cancer cells achieve this feat, we screened for and identified codon-  dependent modifiers of oncogenic Ras in the model organism Drosophila. We will capitalize on these  candidate modifiers in aim 3 to elucidate how cancer cells overcome poor translation of Kras, and in turn,  whether such changes promote more malignant phenotypes. In summary, this research will reveal how  this novel feature of KRAS, codon bias, impacts tumorigenesis."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The system that controls smooth pursuit eye movements is one of the most accessible, promising systems for understanding how neural circuits transform sensory inputs into actions. Pursuit is a natural, ecologically- relevant behavir that allows primates to track moving objects of interest in the visual world. Now-classical analyses relating neural activity to behavior have already provided insights about the systems-level functions and computations of the pursuit circuit that perhaps exceed our understanding of all other voluntary behaviors in mammals. Despite these successes, there are large gaps in our understanding of the pursuit system. We seek a new level in understanding the circuit by measuring and manipulating the activity of large populations of identified neurons in the key sensory and prefrontal cortical areas. We intend to address how different neuronal types function during pursuit, how they implement systems-level computations within micro- and meso-circuits, and how control centers select the appropriate sensory data given cognitive factors. These questions, although stated in the context of the pursuit system, are instances of the more general problem of how population activity in large numbers of sensory neurons is parsed and converted into appropriate behaviors. The time is now ripe to take advantage of several technical and conceptual revolutions: Specifically, we propose to study the neural basis of pursuit eye movements in marmosets, in which cortical areas responsible for motion sensation and target selection are easily accessed and for which genomic toolboxes are being generated. We will investigate the functional circuitry at multiple scales using a combination of 2-photon calcium imaging and large-scale extracellular array electrophysiology, cell-type identification and optogenetic perturbation, and dynamical systems modeling."
"9109305","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chi-yuan Hsu, MD, MSc is applying to renew his Mid-career Investigator Award in Patient Oriented Research (K24) in order to buttress his original research and mentorship efforts. The focus of the new research to be specifically supported by this K24 is incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A long-standing underlying theme of Dr. Hsu's research has been chronic kidney disease (CKD), including the transition from CKD to ESRD, which leads to his current interest in incident ESRD. This proposal addresses how we currently characterize new ESRD patients, how the reported number of new ESRD cases may be heavily influenced by threshold to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and how early outcomes among incident ESRD patients are related to pre-ESRD clinical events. Aim 1: To determine the accuracy of how incident ESRD patients are currently characterized. Aim 2: To quantify how the number of incident ESRD patients vary by the threshold and timing of initiation of chronic dialysis. Aim 3: To better understand early outcomes among incident ESRD patients, including early death and recovery, and how they are related to pre-ESRD clinical events. Dr. Hsu has a very strong prior track record of mentorship and works within the rich, supportive and collegial institutional environment at UCSF. Continued K24 funding will permit Dr. Hsu to spend more time on research and mentoring and less time on administrative and clinical work."
"9162510","Summary Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the most clinically defined but least understood psychiatric disorders. We have uncovered a novel pathway of stress regulation in the brain mediated by the master transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF. Our preliminary studies suggest that the REST pathway may be dysregulated in the brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that treating bipolar patients with lithium, a drug that activates REST, restores homeostasis. This project will address a novel conceptual paradigm that might underlie both disorders involving dysregulation of a stress response system in the brain that is regulated by REST. Initially, we will determine if REST function is altered in neurons derived from induced progenitor stem (iPS) cells of patients and in isogenic iPS cell lines in which we have introduced a schizophrenia-causing genetic variant using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We will then determine if conditional knockout mouse models of REST dysfunction in specific neuronal subpopulations recapitulate behavioral, metabolic and physiological changes associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Finally, we will define transcriptome changes in the brains of schizophrenic and bipolar patients at single neuron resolution to ascertain the role of REST and other transcriptional regulators in specific neuronal cell types. To accomplish this goal, we will advance a new technology we have recently developed called fluorescence in situ sequencing of RNA (FISSEQ). In contrast to conventional sequencing, which requires isolation of DNA or RNA, FISSEQ sequences RNA in intact tissue, bringing together the depth of transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing with the resolution of single molecule in situ RNA localization. FISSEQ can also be multiplexed with other data streams, particularly proteomics, enabling multidimensional interrogation at single cell resolution. FISSEQ will be used to derive reference transcriptomes for identified neural cell types in the human and mouse brain. Differences between reference transcriptomes and transcriptomes of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may implicate REST or other transcription factors, and provide a systems- level view of the central regulatory pathways. This will be complemented by transcriptome analysis in mice genetically engineered to delete or overexpress the REST gene in specific neuronal populations. Although this approach will be used to explore psychiatric disorders, once developed, it could be rapidly employed to elucidate altered genome regulation in any brain disorder. These studies will bring together two principal investigators with complementary areas of expertise in a multidisciplinary approach to understand psychiatric disorders and advance single cell transcriptome analysis of the brain."
"9074406","DESCRIPTION  The aim of Core B is to provide innovative technologies to profile RAS mutation-specific effector signaling.  RAS effector signaling is complex and involves RAS interaction with a multitude (>10) of functionally diverse  downstream effectors. While our current understanding of RAS effector utilization is advanced, it is also far  from complete. To date, four effector families have been implicated in driving RAS-dependent cancer initiation  and growth. Each effector network includes protein kinases. There is also significant crosstalk between the  effector networks. Furthermore, these networks are highly dynamic, with complex feed-forward and feedback  mechanisms. Classically, RAS effector signaling is profiled by evaluation of the two canonical effector  pathways, the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR prosurvival  signaling network, using the phosphorylated state of ERK and AKT as readouts. However, it is now clear that  these analyses alone fail to provide an adequate determination of RAS effector signaling. Since a major goal  of this Program Project is the determination of RAS mutant-specific effector signaling, unbiased kinome-wide  analyses are needed to accomplish this goal. Core B provides two innovative proteomics-based experimental  platforms to accomplish this. First, Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) and Mass Spectroscopy (MIB/MS)  analyses provide kinome-wide profiling of dynamic changes in protein kinase activity. Our preliminary studies  applying MIB/MS to characterize such changes upon KRAS suppression identified protein kinases not  previously known as components of RAS effector signaling, demonstrating the potential for this platform to  identify novel RAS effector signaling outputs. Second, Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analyses will  profile RAS-dependent changes in protein phosphorylation and activation states in cancer cell signaling  networks. Additionally, a recently developed innovative advance in RPPA enabling the profiling of the  activation state of interacting proteins will also be applied. The types of data generated using each  experimental platform are highly complementary. We expect that together they will define novel RAS mutation-  specific effector signaling networks.   "
"9144755","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research applies cognitive engineering methods to understand and support complex, cognition and work activities within the acute care environment, using emergency medicine as the research setting. The research will provide a fundamental and comprehensive picture of work domain complexities and challenging sensemaking, decision-making, and planning/replanning tasks; along with the individual and team expertise required to meet those challenges. The research uses emergency medicine as a field laboratory because it both explicates some of the most challenging conditions for cognitive work - high risk, time-pressure, and uncertainty - and therefore provides a strong opportunity to generalize findings to other complex health care environments; while at the same time providing an environment which can clearly benefit from the decision aids, visualizations, and other supportive technologies that can result from cognitive engineering analyses. This project utilizes the extensive prior experience of research team in human factors and cognitive engineering analyses of health care work (including emergency medicine) and other high risk work environments; and evaluating the usability and effectiveness of information displays and decision support technologies designed to support complex, cognitive work. The application addresses the fundamental, research nature of the call for applications by including a comprehensive cognitive engineering analysis of emergency medicine along with targeted development and evaluation of visualizations, decision- support, and other aiding solutions. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the nature of cognition and clinical work in a high intensity medical environment - including both work related complexities, and practitioner expertise, knowledge, and skills - which can provided a basis for the design of health IT solutions which support clinical work and improve the effectiveness of medical care. Additionally, the research will develop and evaluate exemplar solutions for a targeted set of needs identified through the cognitive engineering analysis, thus providing a methodological example and proof-of-concept for translating cognitive engineering analyses into designs."

"9351452","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical activity (PA) is a modifiable health behavior that impacts the clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patients with COPD are typically older persons who are at exceedingly high risk for sedentary behavior. Novel interventions to promote PA in persons with COPD are desperately needed. We developed a PA intervention, Every Step Counts (ESC), which combines a pedometer (Omron) with a website. ESC emphasizes an iterative process of behavior change with 4 main components: (1) individualized goal setting, (2) iterative feedback, (3) motivation, and (4) social support. Persons with COPD wear the pedometer every day and upload step counts to the study server at least weekly. An automated algorithm calculates a concrete, updated step-count goal each week. Patients receive immediate feedback on the pedometer and view graphs of their walking progress on the website, where motivational and educational content address barriers to exercise in COPD. Participants have access to an online community forum with other users for social support. In a randomized controlled trial, we have rigorously demonstrated that ESC increases daily step counts and improves health-related quality of life (HRQL) in elderly persons with COPD. In its current form our intervention is a research prototype. We propose to collaborate with an industry partner, Modus Health, to upgrade it for wide scale clinical use. We will use the COPD-StepWatch Activity Monitor (COPD-SAM) as the PA sensor. Unlike the Omron, the COPD-SAM will wirelessly upload step-counts to a wristwatch, smart phone, personal computer, and/or tablet. The mobile devices or computer will upload data to the Modus Cloud, and retrieve and display step-count goals and motivational and educational content. Wireless transmission and mobile connectivity will allow the majority of patients to use our intervention, provide near constant interaction between the user and intervention, and minimize burden on the user. We also propose to combine our technology-based intervention with regular peer and provider interactions. Monthly in-person sessions with peers led by existing clinical staff will provide additional social support and motivation. Our current PA intervention has no platform on which clinicians view patients' PA data. Modus Health will develop a platform on which clinicians can view accurate trends in cumulative PA data. Providers, when they routinely see their patients, can use the PA data to provide targeted feedback and motivation. We will implement the intervention in an outpatient pulmonary clinic and test its effectiveness in a real-world trial. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans state, When older adults cannot do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow. We provide a concrete solution to operationalize the clinical response to this recommendation with an accessible, scalable, and sustainable multi-level PA intervention for patients with COPD."
"9261231","Abstract Described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as ?serious, common, and costly?, obesity is now considered a disease by the medical community and has been consistently and causally linked with numerous chronic diseases. Although obesity is the result of numerous contributing factors, poverty and environmental factors present barriers to accessing affordable healthy foods and predispose to food insecurity. Further, obesity and food insecurity emanate from a shared food system and are disproportionately experienced by racial/ethnic minority populations. The Myrlie Evers-Williams Institute for the Elimination of Health Disparities (MEWI) proposes to partner with the HBCU PRIDE (Programs to Increase Diversity Among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research) research training and mentoring center to sponsor a conference entitled, ?A Disparities Paradox? Food Insecurity and Obesity Among Vulnerable Populations? in July 2017 in Jackson, Mississippi. The two- day conference will include 80-100 attendees. The proposed conference will focus on understanding the relationship between food insecurity and obesity over the life course. We propose to use grant funds for conference planning and implementation, the publication of conference proceedings, and to provide support for early career faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and students attending conference (resources will not be used to support travel for fellows with active funding from HBCU PRIDE). The specific aims of the proposed conference are to: Aim 1: Connect obesity health disparity researchers and community-based organizations to develop  complementary solutions addressing obesity and food insecurity among vulnerable populations  that can be evaluated in future research studies. Aim 2: Cultivate and facilitate the formation of working groups to develop and evaluate the efficacy and  effectiveness of interdisciplinary approaches to reducing food insecurity and obesity among  vulnerable populations. Aim 3: Expand and enhance the research networks of early career faculty and students (undergraduate  and graduate) who are underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral sciences, and increase  their exposure to cutting-edge research on obesity health disparities and food insecurity. The overarching goals of the conference are to facilitate interactions among obesity health disparity researchers and community-based organizations addressing hunger to meet the growing health challenges resulting from food insecurity that predominately affect low-income communities, and to expose early career faculty and students underrepresented in biomedical sciences to this important area of research."
"9355370","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The unrivalled increase in human life expectancy over the last century has been one of the greatest achievements of public health medicine. However, it also poses new and unique challenges in health and social care, in particular the increased burden of chronic diseases and associated ageing states, including cognitive impairment and frailty. Understanding the occurrence and determinants of these ageing outcomes has become a global research priority with considerable policy implications. Several studies have been established in middle- and older-aged populations in the US (HRS, MIDUS) with the capacity to offer much- needed insights into these issues. However, it has recently become evident that the processes that underlie ageing states begin much sooner in the life course than originally thought, in some cases as early as birth or preconception. It is in such lif course-orientated studies that the USA is surprisingly bereft. The 1958 British Birth Cohort Study in the UK is the largest long-running study of this genre. With the study members approaching 60 years of age, when problems of ageing begin to emerge with frequency, we will carry out a detailed phenotypic and genotypic survey which covers an array of areas including biological, psychological, socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics. Uniquely, these new data will allow us to answer a series of important research questions of public health importance, ranging from identifying the policy-modifiable behaviours and biological mechanisms in mid-life that successfully reverse the effects of earlier life exposures and adversities on ageing outcomes, through to examining the long term influence of early life educational interventions on social, health, and ageing outcomes in older age, on to running a series of cross-country, and cross-cohort comparisons, to enable us to highlight where such processes are changing across generations, or between countries. These data will become publically available to bone fide population scientists soon after collection, so providing an unrivalled resource for the scientific community to investigate a range of policy- relevant issues."
"9164383","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Being able to read braille and understand tactile graphics is crucial for people who are blind and can no longer read text and graphics visually. Braille replaces text with raised dots, and tactile graphics replace visual graphics with raised lines, textures, and elevations. Blind children, adults, and elderly persons use braille and tactile graphics to access educational and professional content, maintain independence, and participate in their local communities and society (e.g., reading the news). Being braille and tactile-graphic literate involves knowing the symbols (e.g., braille letters) and being able to use effective hand-exploration strategies to read and explore. There are many different hand-movement strategies that can be used, but there is no consensus on which hand-movement strategy is best, and if this varies depending on an individual?s age, knowledge, and skills. The proposed research will directly address which hand movements work best for an individual. During the mentored phase of the award, experiments will be conducted to identify the knowledge and skills that contribute to braille reading and tactile-graphic exploration. The relationship between knowledge/skills and hand-movement strategies will be specified using ideal observer models, which may include Bayesian search models. The models will predict the best hand-movement strategies for an individual to quickly read braille and find a target on a tactile-graphic depending on the individual?s knowledge and skills. During the independent phase of the award, ideal-observer predictions will be compared to the hand-movement strategies used by blind people. It is possible that people use the strategies best suited for their knowledge/skills, but it?s also possible that people use suboptimal strategies that they have been trained to use. Finally, training in ?good? and ?poor? strategies, with subsequent performance evaluation, will used to evaluate ideal-observer predictions. Taken together, these studies will close a gap in the understanding of hand-movement strategies for braille reading and tactile-graphic exploration. Rehabilitation providers, such as those who teach braille and tactile graphics to adults at vocational rehabilitation centers or to children as teachers of students with visual impairments, can use the results from this research to inform their braille and tactile-graphic ministration, instead of falling back on their instincts and conventions."
"9146349","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A common metaphor to describe the brain is that it is like a supercomputer. Consequently, current efforts at improving technologies for large-scale recording of brain function are primarily focused on measuring its electrical activity. However, unlike a supercomputer, the brain is an electrochemical machine. Superimposed upon its network of synaptic connections is a chemical connectome, a largely invisible network of neuromodulators, such as serotonin and neuropeptides (NPs), which exert a profound influence on brain function. Neuromodulators influence brain states that alter the computations performed by neural circuits, and are central to emotion, mood and affect. An understanding of neuromodulatory influences is therefore relevant to psychiatric disorders in humans. Without the ability to measure and manipulate the release of specific neuromodulators, our understanding of neuronal circuit function will be fundamentally incomplete. Nevertheless, a gap remains between our ability to monitor brain electrical activity, and our ability to monitor chemical activty with commensurate spatio-temporal resolution. Specifically, there is no method to visualize the release of specific NPs in the brain, at individual synapses. To fill this gap, we propose to develop a method for imaging the release of specific NPs at the level of nerve terminals, in vivo. The long-term goal is to develop new methods for visualizing, detecting and inhibiting NP release in vivo, and to apply these methods to understanding the dynamics of neuromodulation of specific, behaviorally relevant neural circuits. The overall goal of this proposal is to developa novel approach for time-resolved imaging of NP release from nerve terminals. The central objective of this proposal is to tag components of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs), and specific NPs, with pH-sensitive fluorescent proteins and to determine whether these reporters can be used to image neurosecretory granule release. Drosophila melanogaster provides a useful test-bed for this technology because of its genetic manipulability and sophisticated imaging methodologies. To achieve our objective, in Aim 1 we will fuse different pH-sensitive fluorescent reporters to the protein coding sequences of several LDCV-specific proteins and NPs, and generate transgenic flies. In Aim 2, we will use optogenetic activation of specific neuropeptidergic neurons containing these reporters in vivo, to determine whether activation-dependent increases in fluorescence can be detected, and distinguished from synaptic vesicle (SV) release. The contribution will be to determine the feasibility of the proposed approach, and to achieve a proof- of-principle application of the method. This contribution is significant, because it has the potential to create a transformative new technology with broad general applications. The contribution is innovative, because it combines expertise from cell biology, molecular genetics and neural circuit analysis to develop a novel methodology. The work proposed in this application will therefore benefit the field of neuroscience as a whole, and also enable studies of neural chemistry and circuitry whose dysfunction may underlie psychiatric disorders."
"9071966","SUMMARY ? CORE B: METABOLOMICS  The development of cancer is inherently linked to alterations in cellular metabolism. Exploration of these  changes and the underlying regulatory mechanisms, with the goal of enabling new approaches for the  diagnosis and treatment of melanoma, is a long-range objective of this P01 Program Project. The primary  overall objective for Core B is to apply metabolic profiling methodology developed by core members for the  comprehensive assessment of changes in metabolism upon altered ER homeostasis and mitochondrial  function in melanoma, all processes that are tightly linked to central metabolism. Core B will fulfill this objective  by a unique combination of methodology to comprehensively analyze metabolism, expertise in interpreting  analytical results to explain the broader metabolic picture, and requisite experience in enzymology for detailed  follow-up studies on metabolic enzymes. Central metabolism was already a focus for study in melanoma by the  investigators of this grant in collaboration with the Core B leaders in the first phase of this P01 program. The  Specific Aims of this core are as follows: (1) to provide comprehensive metabolic analytical support to all three  collaborating research projects; (2) to characterize the central metabolism of the set of cell lines used in all  research projects and Core C (melanoma screening and stratification core); and (3) to provide support to the  research projects by assisting in the characterization of enzymes and enzymatic activities. The central method  to be used is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of polar and apolar metabolites in  fractions of cells or medium derived from cultures labeled with stable isotopes (13C). This GC-MS technique  yields data on metabolite quantities and also using isotope tracing, on metabolite origins and flux through  metabolic pathways. Complemented with other methods to measure substrate uptake (YSI) and for oxygen  consumption (Seahorse), it provides a comprehensive assessment of central metabolism. In general, further  advances to this novel approach to metabolic analysis will also provide a model for future studies on cancer  metabolism and cellular metabolism in general."
"9253909","ABSTRACT This project will harness recent technological developments in smart tablets and other mobile devices: their proliferation and affordability; their increased use in pedagogy and healthcare; and the numerous benefits they afford, such as personalization, connectedness, mobility, and improved learning outcomes. These developments will be leveraged to improve the uptake, appropriate implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based behavioral interventions (EBIs) that help prevent the spread of HIV. For this Phase II project, we will complete the development and field testing of the Prevention Tablet (PTab), an application for use on the web as well as via native apps on iOS and Android tablets. PTab will help health educators overcome identified barriers to the uptake and implementation of EBIs. For the Phase II scope of work, we will focus on PTab's hosting HIV prevention EBIs that are aimed at populations of special interest to NIH's National Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD). These population groups include ?racial and ethnic minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians and other U.S. Pacific Islanders), socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, and medically underserved individuals residing in rural and urban areas? (NIMHD website). Post Phase II, as PTab is commercialized, other EBIs can and will be hosted on PTab, whether minority-focused or not, HIV prevention-focused or not. In short, PTab will be a revolutionary platform for increasing the uptake, implementation, and evaluation of EBIs. PTab is the first mobile application/platform designed especially for EBI educators, facilitators, and implementers working in real-world settings. These users can use PTab anytime, anywhere to access all program content as well as core features tailored for their current tasks, whether when preparing for implementation, while running a session, or after completing a session. PTab has tools like digital note-taking, reminders to prepare materials, on-screen timers for session outlines to ensure coverage of core elements, and digital forms to streamline process and outcome evaluation. With an Internet connection, PTab users have access to supplementary content and value-added features through links to EBI Connect, an online community of EBI practitioners and educators managed by Sociometrics; as well as SurveyGizmo, a survey creation, data collection, analysis and reporting tool that will be pre-populated with the evaluation questionnaires for PTab's EBIs. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility and utility of PTab by conducting a needs assessment as well as building and usability testing dynamic working prototypes of the PTab web app and the PTab iOS native app. The present Phase II proposal will: complete the development of the PTab web app as well as the PTab native apps for both iOS and Android tablets; make 15 minority-focused HIV prevention EBIs available for use on computers, tablets, or smartphones; and conduct a field study to assess PTab's impact on EBI uptake and implementation fidelity."
"9110745","DESCRIPTION:           This project seeks to rapidly advance the state of the art in understanding and discovering new therapeutic agents for the treatment of traumatic injury to cartilage. Excessive loads and blunt force trauma are responsible for initiating and furthering cartilage pathology and eventually an under repaired joint surface that progressively deteriorates and functionally fails. Indeed, patients with focal cartilage defects have quality of life scores comparable to those with severe osteoarthritis (OA), further emphasizing the need for early intervention. Post-traumatic OA (PTOA) defines the subset of OA patients whose cartilage pathology emerged directly as a consequence of trauma to the joint and in fact probably started with the traumatic injury to the joint. PTOA is widespread in both the general and military population, and is largely untreatable and untreated in current clinical practice. The challenge in cartilage repair after such injuries i the inherent poor healing capacity of the native tissue and the lack of molecules that can be used at the time of injury to preserve cell viability, biosynthetic activities, and foster intrinsi repair. Moreover, there is currently no high throughput screening method that models this injury state, and so no clear route forward for the rapid identification of novel therapeutics that could improve clinical practice and patient outcomes after injury. Our design platform is centered on the development of cartilage- like tissues on the micro-scale and in large quantities. We then mechanically impact these cartilage tissue analogs (CTAs) and assess their cellular and overall degenerative response as a function of time subsequent to insult. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will scale up an existing validated high throughput testing system to accommodate even larger sample numbers and develop rapid and cost effective outcome measures specific to degradative signaling in cartilage after injury, thus making the testing platform suitable for high  throughput screening (HTS). In Aim 2, we will validate this novel device in conjunction with engineered CTAs and native tissue, so as to match the timing and magnitude of key signaling events that occur after injury. In Aim 3, we will use this validated system to screen commercially available small molecule libraries in order to identify molecules important in chondrocyte response to injury. In Aim 4, we will use both soluble and biomaterial-mediated delivery systems in order to test the therapeutic efficacy of identified compounds (and their combinations) in human tissue analogs and native human cartilage response to injury.  These delivery systems are designed to enable rapid translation to subsequent pre-clinical animal models and ultimately to human clinical trials. The study is highly translational in that it relates to the all too commo instance of blunt force trauma and injury to cartilage, a condition extremely prevalent in the active duty military population, and will provide a novel and much needed testing platform for small molecule discovery in this clinical domain."
"9246288","The broad, long term objectives of this project are to discover how neurons in the brain encode information about taste stimuli. To further our understanding of taste processing, the present project is focused on temporal coding in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) the first central relay in the rat taste system. In addition to receiving information about taste directly from the tongue, the NTS also receives input from a number of higher order brain structures. In the present proposal, we will investigate the descending influence of two of these structures, the gustatory cortex (GC) and the lateral hypothalamus (LH) on temporal coding in the NTS and on learned behavior.  HYPOTHESES are a) centrifugal input from the GC to the NTS modulates the temporal characteristics of taste- evoked spike trains and that these changes will be expressed as changes in taste acuity and discrimination., and b) LH-NTS input regulates behavioral responses to taste, i.e. licking, and thus controls the events around which the temporal code is referenced.  SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Using selective optogenetic (OG) stimulation of the GC input to the NTS, test the hypothesis that this input will change the temporal characteristics of taste responses (including temporal pattern and firing rate) increasing the quantity of information conveyed about taste quality (Experiment 1.1) and enhancing discrimination of similar tastants (Experiment 1.2). We will use Go-no-Go (GnG) and conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigms (in separate groups of rats) as tests of taste discrimination. For all experiments, it is hypothesized that inhibition of GC-NTS input will have opposite effects. 2) Test the hypothesis that LH-NTS input modifies lick- related and anti-lick neural activity in rostral NTS neurons according to palatability (Experiment 2.1) and that that selective OG enhancement of LH-NTS terminals will modify the performance in GnG and CTA paradigms through a specific modification in the ability to control initiation and inhibition of lick bouts (Experiment 2.2). Both excitatory and inhibitory viruses will be used."
"9163388","Communication is a dynamic process by which information is transferred across people. For the sake of experimental control, however, most cognitive neuroscience work on communication focus on either language production in the speaker's brain or comprehension in the listener's brain during highly artificial tasks. Communication, which by nature is a joint action embedded in a social context, is paradoxically studied in single individuals in isolation. In this proposal, we advance a new and versatile framework for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying communication in the real world. This framework argues that effective communication emerges when the neural activity of the two interlocutors are ?coupled? together. This coupling can take the form of (1) mirroring, when the listener's neural patterns match those of the speaker; (2) conditional transformations, when the listener's patterns reflect a lawful relation to the speaker's neural patterns; or (3) synergies, when the activities of the two brains dynamically influence and constrain each other to optimize information sharing. To test our theoretical framework, we propose developing both stationary and portable dual-brain imaging systems for measuring the neural activity of multiple individuals engaged in dialogue in the laboratory and in clinical settings. Two of the systems, fMRI hyperscanning and ECoG hyperscanning, take advantage of the high spatial and high temporal resolution of the respective methods to precisely characterize coupled neural dynamics during dialogue. For the third system, we propose developing a portable, dual-brain fNIRS system to characterize how two brains interact in real-life settings. Field work measuring the level of brain-to-brain coupling between a caregiver and a child could be used to study the acquisition of a first language; as an early preverbal biomarker for developmental disorder (e.g. lack of caregiver-child coupling as an early biomarker for autism); and as a temporally refined diagnostic tool for evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacological interventions aimed at alleviating communication deficits (e.g. in autism, schizophrenia). Although the proposed research is technologically challenging, this laboratory has a track record of developing innovative analysis tools and theoretical frameworks for the study of cognitive functions in real-life contexts. The PI has substantial experience working with ECoG, fMRI and fNIRS, as well as studying both neurotypical and clinical populations. Our proposal is strongly grounded in prior work studying the extent of shared neural responses across subjects during the processing of real-life information. Thus, although ambitious, the research plan is both feasible and grounded, and has the potential to transform the way we understand and assess the neural processes by which we interact with others in everyday contexts. Ultimately, we believe that this work will lead to a novel brain-to-brain coupling biomarker for detecting preverbal communication disorders and assessing interventions in clinical settings."
"9142287","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The theory and outcome measure Failure-to-Rescue (FTR) was developed to assess hospital quality of care for surgical patients. This proposal seeks to extend FTR to the analysis of medical conditions. FTR measures the ability of caregivers to manage a patient who becomes complicated and keep them from dying. The measure depends on the ability of the analyst to differentiate complications from comorbidities and on the completeness of the available data in detecting complications. Due to difficulties in distinguishing complications from comorbidities, FTR has been applied almost exclusively to surgical cases. Since the metric FTR was first introduced by Silber in 1992, there have been many applications of the metric for quality assessment of surgical care, and it has been a useful metric for exploring the importance of hospital characteristics, nursing characteristics, and physician characteristics. FTR has been endorsed in multiple forms by the National Quality Forum. Unfortunately, the benefits of the FTR metric, both with respect to improving severity adjustment and gaining insight into why a hospital or provider may be performing poorly on mortality metrics, have never been successfully applied to patients with medical conditions. However, there has been a radical change in the data sets available to analysts since 1992 when FTR was first developed. Medicare claims data now provide a present on admission (POA) indicator for all diagnoses, which could greatly improve the ability of analysts to distinguish complications from comorbidities when implementing a medical FTR analysis. Therefore, it is now possible to potentially develop and validate a medical FTR metric. Given the demand for improved quality metrics by both the public and health policy analysts alike, it would seem like an ideal time to extend the measure to medical conditions. This project has 4 aims: AIM 1: Using national Medicare data and state data from California, we will develop and validate a list of FTR complications for major medical conditions including CHF, AMI, and Pneumonia. AIM 2: Using results from AIM 1, develop a medical FTR metric for each medical condition and study the properties of the FTR metric. We will explore 2 types of FTR rates: The original Silber defined approach (FTR) using all complications and the AHRQ approach (A-FTR) using a subset of complications and deaths, and we will compare results for all subsequent hypotheses. AIM 3: Develop a severity adjustment model for medical FTR and A-FTR, and finally, AIM 4: Determine the reliability and validity of the medical FTR metric. In summary, this proposal will establish a new approach to examining quality of care for medical conditions based on Failure-to-Rescue. Our intent is to bring to the medical community the advantages of using a failure-to-rescue analysis in a parallel manner to surgical patients."
"9234805","Project Summary Childhood temperament broadly shapes psychological adjustment across the lifespan, having particular influence during critical and complex periods of development such as adolescence. While risk for psychopathology rises sharply during adolescence, temperamental differences further enhance risk. Behavioral Inhibition (BI) is a temperament identified early in life, marked by strong physiological, behavioral, and emotional reactions to unfamiliar contexts, and associated with a four-fold increased risk for anxiety disorders in mid-adolescence, as well as mood disorders and substance abuse in late adolescence. Despite the dramatic increase in risk, we have found that not all children with a childhood history of BI go on to display psychopathology. Given this heterogeneity in risk outcomes, it is critical to identify the mechanisms that differentiate adolescents who struggle from those who adapt despite early risk factors. For adolescents with a history of BI, the increasing demands of their rapidly evolving social context may be particularly challenging. Unsuccessful attempts to negotiate the complex social challenges of adolescence are linked to increases in psychopathology, making mid-adolescence a critical period for isolating mechanisms that might influence variability in outcomes. We are proposing to examine two such mechanisms, cognitive control and supportive relationships with friends and parents, and their impact on adolescents? reactions to, and regulation following, social challenges assessed in the laboratory and using daily diary reports. We will examine: (1) two types of cognitive control (reactive versus proactive) with the expectation that reactive control will be positively associated, and proactive control will be negatively associated with heightened reactions to social challenge and greater psychopathology, and (2) the effects of supportive relationships with friends and parents with the expectation that such relationships will buffer the effects of stressful social challenges and increased incidence of psychopathology. Finally, we will examine whether adolescents? responses to social challenge mediate the association between childhood history of BI and psychopathology in late adolescence."
"9142282","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): eHealth may be generally described as the use of Internet-based and mobile technologies to assess, monitor, and improve health. eHealth activity among post-treatment cancer survivors is a vital area of study as survivors are a growing group with greater healthcare needs than the general population and more frequent healthcare involvement. eHealth represents a promising approach to addressing the multiple and often overwhelming needs of cancer survivorship, yet data show that survivors do not engage in a wide range of eHealth activity. This raises the questions 1) to what extent are diverse cancer survivors engaged in eHealth activity, and 2) what are the determinants of eHealth activity? Previous work suggests that those with greater healthcare needs may be more likely to use eHealth resources, raising the possibility that African American (AfAm) survivors may be more likely to engage in certain eHealth activities due to the survivorship disparities experienced by this group. Furthermore, lower rates of some eHealth activities versus others make it probable that survivors use non-digital/electronic strategies to manage their healthcare needs, specifically, their personal health information management (PHIM). In the proposed R01 study, we will conduct theory-driven mixed methods interviews in a population-based sample of approximately 1230 AfAm and white breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors to assess general eHealth activity as well as specific activities. We will then select a subsample of 144 participants for an ethnography of PHIM in one's home or primary PHIM setting to examine the role of eHealth in the context of all PHIM practices. Finally, these data will guide the development of survivor-centered design principles that will inform the development of a software application prototype that will facilitate access to digital cancer survivorship resources Specific aims are 1) To examine racial differences in general eHealth activity among AfAm and white cancer survivors; 2) To examine racial differences in specific categories of eHealth activity among AfAm and white cancer survivors; and 3) To explore the role of eHealth activity in the broader context of personal health information management among AfAm and white cancer survivors; 4) To develop survivor-centered design principles that will be applied to the development of an eHealth tool for cancer survivors; and Exploratory Aim - To compare cancer survivors with and without internet access in terms of social-structural determinants of access and clinical and healthcare-related factors relevant to survivorship. The proposed study is relevant to public health because it will investigate eHealth activity among cancer survivors, of which there are 13.7 million in the U.S. today, many of whom confront a wide range of challenges to their physical, psychological, and social well-being. The technology within eHealth resources has the potential to address the needs of this population on a large scale. The proposed population-based study will identify determinants of eHealth activity, provide deep insight into the role of eHealth in survivors' overall PHIM, and establish survivor-centered design principles for optimized eHealth tool development."
"9348968","Current therapies designed to treat Alzheimer's disease based on a single disease mechanism have not changed this debilitating disorder in humans. While individual targets are critical to uncover, it is likely that interacting pathways are altered in AD. The immune system of the brain is a network of interdependent pathways whose regulation is not well understood but which is clearly implicated in AD. We know, however, that AD is a chronic disorder and results in slow deterioration of the brain over a number of years. Based on our recently published studies, we propose that loss of neurons in AD is not due to toxic pro-inflammatory mechanisms that rapidly kill cells. Our data suggest a different pathology; one that involves immune-mediated nutrient deprivation caused by prolonged immunosuppression. We propose that prolonged immunosuppression initiated by microglia changes the levels of arginine and methionine in the surrounding microenvironment, disrupting interrelated metabolic pathways either within microglia or other cells that are dependent on a maintained supply of these amino acids for normal function. We hypothesize that a patterned change in levels of the amino acids used during the prolonged immune response will lead to a consistent and definable profile of specific metabolic and functional outcomes within the brain's parenchyma. We further hypothesize these patterns will be different between normal (unaffected) and AD-like conditions and will change with progression of AD-like pathology. In Aim 1 we will use our novel mouse model of AD at early and late stage of disease to define patterns of specific amino acids, tissue metabolites, and gene and protein expression levels that characterize immune regulated arginine and methionine. Entry point into this immune regulated system is through activation of an anti-inflammatory related protein, arginase and through subsequent arginine utilization and its impact on other pathways that require arginine. We will stress the interlocking system by dietary reduction or supplementation of arginine and/or methionine. Aim 2 will measure specific functional outcomes that result from the immune-induced amino acid and metabolite changes in the brains of AD and normal mice including cell proliferation (via polyamines) and methylation and its impact on myelin (via methionine and methyl donors). Aim 3 will block the disrupted and restore normal patterns by blocking arginase to determine if a single target approach is viable at early or late stage disease."
"9218194","PROJECT SUMMARY  The primary pathological change underlying the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson?s disease (PD) is death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of the basal ganglia (BG). Traditionally, therapeutic strategies for improving motor function in PD patients have relied on replacement of lost dopamine; recently, increasing efforts have focused on developing non-dopaminergic drug treatments for PD. The mGlu4 subtype of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor has emerged as a promising new target for potential therapeutic agents to normalize activity in BG motor circuits. mGlu4 is highly expressed on presynaptic GABAergic terminals within the ?indirect pathway? of the BG, and agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of mGlu4 reduce transmission of indirect pathway neurons projecting from the striatum to the external segment of the globus pallidus. Numerous mGlu4 PAMs from international labs have consistently shown efficacy in inducing antiparkinsonian activity in multiple preclinical Parkinson?s models. In addition, increasing evidence suggests that activation or potentiation of mGlu4 may also have neuroprotective effects.  We have developed a first-in-class, highly selective, optimized PAM of mGlu4 termed VU0652597. VU0652957 exhibits good functional potency and efficacy at rodent and human mGlu4 and is highly selective among the mGlus as well as a panel of other clinically relevant receptors, including cardiac ion channels. An Ames test with VU0652957, both with and without S9 hepatic fractions, was negative, indicating a low risk of parent or metabolite mutagenicity. VU0652957 is also at low risk for CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions and displays a favorable unbound fraction in plasma proteins and brain homogenates. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys have demonstrated that VU0652957 is a moderately cleared compound with >30% oral bioavailability in all species examined. VU0652957 exhibits robust activity in a haloperidol- induced catalepsy model and reversal of catalepsy correlates closely with CSF concentrations that reach or exceed the in vitro potency at rat mGlu4, indicating a good pharmacokinetic:pharmacodynamic relationship that could be eventually used as a biomarker to set dose for clinical trials. A four step synthesis of VU0652957 was developed at VCNDD and is currently being optimized and executed on 200 gram scale. During the UH2 preparatory phase, we propose to perform formulation work, dose range finding studies in rats and dogs, and synthesis of VU0652957 for good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology studies. Proposed plans for the UH3 phase include GLP analytical method development and validation, safety pharmacology, genetic toxicology, and rat and dog toxicology studies. It is anticipated that the completion of IND-enabling studies through the BPN initiative will position VU0652957 for testing in clinical populations of PD patients."
"9355937","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol is one of the most commonly abused drugs in the US, with 10% of the population affected by alcohol dependence at some point in their lives. There is a critical need for the development of new medications to help alcohol dependent patients reduce their alcohol use and promote abstinence. One of key predictors of relapse is severity of alcohol craving and urge to drink, which are thought to be due to classically conditioned states, and neuroadaptive changes associated with chronic alcohol consumption and abstinence. Potential targets for new medications include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and opioid systems, which become dysregulated with chronic excessive alcohol consumption. In the current proposal, we will evaluate a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, benzodiazepine-GABAA alpha1 receptor antagonists/partial agonists and modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors, as potential AUD medications to reduce persistent alcohol seeking and compulsive drinking. The proposed studies will utilize a validated drinking procedure in baboons that combines classical and operant conditioning and models characteristic patterns of human problem drinking ('too much, too fast, too often'). The procedure consists of a sequence of separate behavioral contingencies, each of which is correlated with a unique cue, to form different links of a chain of responses that ultimately resul in alcohol reinforcement. This procedure allows examination of the relationships between alcohol seeking and self-administration responses during ongoing alcohol consumption, as well as the ability to study persistence cue-maintained behaviors during abstinence. We propose to examine test drug effects on alcohol-maintained behaviors under conditions of abstinence and alcohol availability, and different dosing regimens common to AUD treatment. Aim 1 will determine whether test drugs selectively reduce alcohol seeking and alter patterns of self-administration during daily access to alcohol. Aim 2 will determine whether test drugs facilitate extinction of alcohol-directed responding during ongoing alcohol access and during abstinence. Aim 3 will determine whether initiation and maintenance of subchronic treatment with test drugs during abstinence selectively reduces seeking and intake upon return to alcohol access. Aim 4 will determine incidence of side effects of test drugs administered under conditions of ongoing drinking and abstinence. Integration of the data from these aims will be used to determine the therapeutic potential of each drug. That is, a drug with therapeutic potential would reduce cue-maintained alcohol seeking during abstinence, reduce seeking and self-administration during ongoing alcohol access, and produce few side effects. Comparison of dose effect functions in the alcohol and control groups will provide a therapeutic index of each test drug under conditions of alcohol access and abstinence. These studies will provide important, new information on the differential behavioral efficacy of compounds that target receptor mechanisms relevant to compulsive alcohol use and relapse in humans."
"9349746","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An invariant feature of the pathological cascade in Alzheimer's diseases (AD) is a reactive gliosis, reflecting an underlying alteration in the innate immune activation state within the brain. Innate immune signaling is altered early in AD, but is also skewed towards an activated state as a consequence of brain aging. There is strong genetic evidence that innate immunity has a significant role in AD. Variants in two genetic loci that play roles in the complement cascade, CR1 and CLU, show significant genetic associations with AD, and rare coding variants in TREM2 also confer substantial risk for AD. Numerous experimental studies in AD mouse models show that manipulating innate immune pathways can have positive or negative effects on proteostasis, cognition and neurodegeneration. At least when assessing A? pathology as an endpoint, the beneficial effects of some innate immune system manipulations are robust. We propose to identify therapeutic targets within the innate immune signaling cascade in AD that could be safely manipulated to provide disease modification in AD. However, because of the complexity of, and the gaps in our knowledge regarding, innate immune signaling within the CNS, a systems level approach that integrates multiple types of data will be required to achieve this goal. Indeed, development of any innate immune therapy will need to be finely tuned and extensively validated in order to be further developed as a potential AD therapy. We will use a multifaceted systems level approach to identify targets within innate immune signaling pathways that can safely provide disease modifying effects in AD. Comprehensive, transcriptomic, genetic and pathological data from both humans and mouse models will be generated, integrated and analyzed in novel ways. This integrated data will then be used to guide multiple preclinical target validation studies of key innate immune targets in both APP and tau mouse models as well as non-transgenic mice. These studies will dramatically accelerate the identification and validation of disease modifying innate immune modulatory strategies in AD and will provide important insights into how these various manipulations of innate immune activation states alter normal behaviors with an emphasis on cognition."
"9129560","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This is troubling given that screening rates are marked by a pronounced disparity, with Latinos who have been in the United States for fewer than 10 years and the uninsured having the lowest rates. These individuals generally receive care at one of over 1,200 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that serve over 21 million persons nationwide. While colorectal cancer screening rates among FQHC patients are a cause for great concern, studies have demonstrated success for improving screening rates. Programs that mail fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) kits with pictograph instructions to eligible patients report higher screening rates. While new technologies, such as automated phone calls and text messages, have been explored to remind patients to complete screening, little is known about their effectiveness in diverse populations. Moreover, such programs often adopt a one-size fits all approach and their effectiveness has not been tested among subgroups least likely to be screened. To address these issues, we will work with the advisory board assembled for our successful STOP CRC project and additional community stakeholders to adapt and spread a direct-mail FIT and reminder program (PROMPT) in two phases. In Phase I, we will design and evaluate a randomized controlled trial to test systems-based, automated and non-automated strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening in an FQHC with diverse patient populations. In Phase II, we will assess the spread of the program to 11 clinics (estimated age-eligible patient population ~ 22,000). The proposed study's design and evaluation will be guided by the RE-AIM framework using intervention mapping and will involve low-income and ethnically diverse patients who are served by Yakima Valley Farmworkers Clinic. PROMPT will be the first trial to sequentially test the effectiveness of reminders to a direct-mail colorectal cancer screening program, then spread the selected best practice to additional clinics within the FQHC network. PROMPT will apply novel and locally develop strategies to engage stakeholders in adapting the intervention, defining the intervention components, and selecting a best practice for spread. If the trial succeeds, it will have broad-scale implementation potential for a similar program to decrease cancer screening disparities."

OIB is strongly interdisciplinary,  integrating basic scientists with technologists and clinicians and is focused around 3 key themes. Critically,  each of the themes includes basic science, technology development, and translational research activities  spanning from animal models to human subjects in various types of cancers, including breast, skin, GI, oral  cavity, prostate, and brain. We also apply emerging technologies in multi-center and cooperative group clinical  trials in order to standardize and validate methods and endpoints for improved cancer detection and clinical  management. The three themes are: 1) Cancer imaging and treatment using Biophotonics and Biomedical  Optics technologies, including a broad range of non-linear optical microscopies, Laser Microbeams, Optical  Coherence Tomography, Acousto-Optic Imaging and Elastography, Laser Speckle Imaging, Spatial Frequency  Domain Imaging, and Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging; 2) Cancer imaging and treatment using MRI,  Nuclear, X-Ray/CT, multi-Modality technologies; and 3) Cancer detection and therapy using molecular, cellular,  and material technologies, from nano- and microfluidic platforms and integrated ?lab-on-a-chip? and ?body-on-  a-chip? systems, to advanced cellular and molecular diagnostics for improved cancer detection and therapy.

"9219781","SUMMARY The overall objective is to understand of the factors mediating and moderating transfer of learning in the context of training Working Memory (WM) systems. There is accumulating evidence that WM training impacts performance in a wide variety of tasks, however, to date, knowledge is extremely limited regarding the underlying mechanisms that mediate plasticity in WM systems, and what components of training give rise to transfer to different tasks. This proposal is transformative in how it applies knowledge derived from plasticity in other brain systems (such as perceptual learning, where there is substantial understanding of mechanisms that dtrive transfer) to test their impact in WM systems (Aim 1), in the creation of novel measures to asses transfer to real-world cognition (Aim 2), and in the use of online ?crowd-sourced? studies to characterize individual differences using a large population (Aim 3). These studies are particularly important and timely given current state of the field, which is fraught with controversy, and the lack of understanding of the relevant attributes of training and individual differences factors that give rise to successful training outcomes. Understanding the factors that mediate successful learning, as well as the individual differences moderating these is critical to resolve the current controversies and to move towards a theoretical model of training and transfer. Potential for knowledge gain and translational impact is substantial. Understanding how our memory systems work and the mechanisms that guide learning has great potential to be applied broadly in society. Our acquisition of knowledge in the world intimately relies on WM processes, thus, improvements in WM can benefit almost all aspects of our lives. This has driven a now billion-dollar commercial market that has provided early generation training approaches, which are extremely controversial in the scientific community. The proposed research can shed light on the factors that mediate and moderate these types of cognitive interventions and address the extent to which some procedures may, and others may not, lead to improvements in real world cognition. This can potentially lead to educational, rehabilitative, and technological advancements. For example, WM deficits exist in a wide range of mental health conditions, cases of disease and brain damage, and in cognitive declines with aging, and training approaches that promote better functioning WM systems can promote health and well-being in these groups. Further this research can elucidate approaches that may not work and help people avoid use of infective procedures. The proposed training software will be created on cross-platform game engines to enable dissemination to diverse populations. In this sense, the research output has innovative and broad impacts that can be directly realized from the proposed research. Many individuals are already using ?brain training? products, however, none incorporate the theoretically-driven approaches designed to optimize WM learning with an aim to transfer that training to real world benefit, and that are systematically researched, as proposed here. Programs created in the proposed work will be made publically available."

We will coordinate the activities of this project with those of Project 1 and Project 2 to test our working hypothesis that tau-mediated toxicity in the autophagic pathways underlie the basis for the altered tau proteostasis and functional alterations observed in FTD-affected neurons. Project 3 will use cutting edge proteomics (MS Core) and genetics (CRISPR Core) in iPSC-derived neurons to investigate: 1) effect of pathogenic intra- and extracellular tau in the activity of three different forms of selective autophagy; 2) consequences of blockage of each of these forms of autophagy on neuronal activity and tau uptake. Project 3 will also utilize postmortem frozen human brain tissue from controls and FTD-tau patients (Human Core) to identify 3) changes in the properties of tau associated with autophagic compartments in control and patient brains. Assisted by the CRISPR Core, we will modulate levels of differentially tau- interacting proteins and address the effect of this intervention on autophagy and neuronal activity. Integration of data (Data Core) generated by this project with that from the other two projects in the Center will allow us to elucidate the contribution of tau toxicity on the autophagic system to the neuronal activity imbalance observed in FTD."
"9209336","Overlay independent X-ray data analysis for enhanced oxime OP-ChE reactivation  Project Summary. Vulnerability of large civilian and military populations to organophosphate (OP) exposure remains an unfortunate peril of the present day. Both, nerve agent OPs and OP based pesticides are realistic and alarmingly significant hazards. Recent horrifying massive nerve agent poisoning episodes in Syria and daily worldwide fatalities associated with OP based pesticide exposures reveal general lack of appropriateness of currently employed measures for counteracting OP intoxications. The emphasis is on affordability, availability and efficacy. More than two hundred AChE and BChE structures deposited in PDB in the past 25 years reveal unusually consistent protein conformations, not only of protein backbones but also of majority of amino acid side chains. This apparent absence of conformational flexibility registered at the low temperature and in the solid crystaline state, appears as a contrast to an extreemely high catalytic output, in particular in the long and narrow AChE active center gorge. Catalytically essential, thermally driven, ?breathing? fluctuations of the AChE and BChE protein backbones have long been suspected and proposed but have never been clearly demonstrated experimentally. In particular for oxime reactivation reactions backbone fluctuations appear essential due to highly restricted access to covalently attached OPs in the narrow actice center space impacted further by covalently bound OP conjugates. For design of an accelerated, efficient reactivator molecule it is critical to know what parts of active center have structural predisposition to move and facilitate nucleophilic oxime approach to the phosphorus atom in geometrically optimal fashion. This information is encripted in hundreds of resolved and deposited ChE structures and our goal is to extract it to an useful form.  We expect to detect structural fluctuations small in magnitude yet systematic in nature. Our initial manual analyses confirm those expectations."
"9127726","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9352477","PROJECT SUMMARY Visual impairments are quite prevalent in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (A?) deposits can often be seen in retinas of AD patients early in the disease process, and chronic deposition of these amyloid plaques progressively leads to degeneration and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Importantly, AD-related pathological changes in the retina closely resemble AD-related pathological changes in the brain, making the retina an outstanding alternative tissue for AD research. In this multidisciplinary study, we combine our multiyear research on retinal degeneration and RGC loss (in multiple neurodegenerative conditions) with new ideas from the published literature to propose an innovative model for AD pathogenesis. We note that the Tlr4 and Rage signaling cascades mediate AD-related pathological damage in both the retina and the brain parenchyma proper. We also observe that A? deposits in the retina stimulate RGC death not only by apoptosis, but also by necrosis. Programmed RGC necrosis (necroptosis) contributes to retinal injury through direct loss of RGCs and induction (via release endogenous factors such as Hmgb1 and Hsp70) of an inflammatory response. Our data also indicate that NF?B signaling is significantly suppressed in RGCs exposed to neurotoxic conditions, usually resulting in RGC death, chiefly by necrosis. In contrast, glial cells and infiltrating leukocytes subjected to neurotoxic conditions do activate NF?B signaling; these cells demonstrate not only increased survival but also increased production of neurotoxic pro- inflammatory factors. Our model proposes that, following A? binding, Tlr4 and/or Rage receptors mediate NF?B activation in glial cells and infiltrating leukocytes, facilitating survival of these cells but also initiating production of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF. But in RGCs exposed to A? and TNF, a lack of NF?B activity contributes to cell death, mostly by necroptosis. Endogenous factors liberated from necrotic RGCs go on to augment the effects of A? deposits, reactivating glial and leukocyte Tlr4/Rage signaling and therefore upregulating the pro-inflammatory response. These events form a positive feedback loop that ultimately results in significant tissue damage. We will employ animal models of AD and a wide range of biochemical, molecular, and cell biological techniques to test our model in hypothesis-driven mechanistic experiments, outlined in the following specific aims: to test the hypotheses that 1) the Tlr4 and Rage signaling cascades coordinate the neurotoxic pro-inflammatory response and increased blood-retinal barrier permeability in retinas of mouse models of AD; 2) A? deposition mediates retinal damage by promoting RGC necroptosis; 3) increased activity of the NF?B signaling cascade supports the survival of damaged RGCs and regulates the regrowth of axons in models of AD. Upon completing these specific aims, we expect that the results will provide substantial insights and novel strategies for regulating AD pathogenesis, ultimately contributing to innovative therapies for improving vision and quality of life in AD patients."
"9132667","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The perirhinal cortex (PRC), a medial temporal lobe subregion (MTL), is necessary for declarative memory processes such as familiarity-based recognition. In contrast, the hippocampus (HC) is critical for recollection- based recognition. Considerable work investigating the structural and functional integrity of these MTL subregions in healthy aging indicates that PRC and familiarity are spared relative to HC and recollection. In contrast, age-related neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are associated with broad MTL pathology and memory impairments. This dissociation serves as a potential biomarker of pathological aging and early diagnosis of dementias. However, recent work challenges this dissociation, as there is evidence of age-related PRC dysfunction in perceptual discriminations and evidence that age-related decrements in PRC volume are related to familiarity impairments. These data raise the possibility of impaired PRC function in older adults under certain conditions. It is critical to understand the boundaries of such conditions given the implications for both early diagnosis of dementias and cognitive training and rehabilitation.  Based on its anatomy and connectivity, PRC has been proposed to be divisible into lateral and medial portions that respectively support perceptual and conceptual processing. Consistent with this, there is evidence from two lines of work that PRC supports both perceptual and conceptual representations that can subserve subsequent familiarity, although these disparate literatures have not systematically compared. Given evidence of impaired perceptual relative to conceptual processing in older adults, it may be the case that impaired perceptual encoding accounts for PRC dysfunction and memory impairments in healthy aging. The two proposed fMRI studies explore whether lateral and medial PRC respectively supports perceptual and conceptual processing, and whether the former but not the latter is affected in healthy aging. Study 1 examines age-related changes in conceptual (e.g., word) and perceptual (e.g., face) discriminations that relate to subsequent familiarity, and the extent to which these processes are supported by lateral and medial PRC. Study 2 explores age-related changes in differential functional and structural connectivity networks with lateral and medial PRC supporting the subsequent conceptual and perceptual familiarity of encoded objects (which contain both conceptual and perceptual details). To assess the sensitivity of lateral and medial PRC to perceptual and conceptual information, we propose to examine the extent to which univariate activity, multi- voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), and functional connectivity predicts subsequent familiarity. Moreover, we will assess individual differences in the relationship between behavior and lateral and medial PRC function and volume, as well as white matter (diffusion tensor imaging) integrity with other cortical regions supporting perceptual and conceptual processes. These analyses allow us to better understand how and to what extent healthy aging affects conceptual and perceptual representations thought to subserve familiarity in PRC."
"8998408","Project Summary  Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is the administrative home for all of the units that support  clinical research at the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC), providing essential support for and monitoring of all  clinical research conducted in the ACC regardless of the type of intervention or sponsor. The CPDM, in  collaboration with ACC Leadership, creates, directs and enforces the operational standards (policies) and  expectations for the conduct of all clinical research within the ACC. The CPDM scope is of necessity broad,  encompassing development and updating of policies and procedures, education and training, supervision of  data managers and research nurses, and oversight over all of the specialty clinical research units within our  Center. The CPDM manages our centralized Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS), Velos, organizes  and performs quality assurance and QC/monitoring of clinical trials across the center, and directly manages the  complex, ongoing and recurring activities of our mandatory clinical research review committees. Key units  supported by the CPDM are the Department of Compliance and Monitoring (DOCM), the Protocol Review and  Monitoring System (PRMS, known as the Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee  [CTSRMC]), the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and the Clinical Research Unit (CRU).  While CPDM provides the administrative support for PRMS and DSMC, it is vital to note that these are, by  design, distinct entities. PRMS is described elsewhere in this renewal. The inclusion of Women and  Minorities in clinical trials is a central focus of ACC Leadership and clinical investigators as a component of  our commitment to addressing the cancer burden in minority and underserved populations. During the current  award period, the ACC implemented several initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in cancer incidence and  mortality in minorities, including completion of quality improvement training to further increase the diversity of  the patients on cancer clinical trials at ACC, establishment of additional key partnerships with community  organizations to increase educational efforts and community outreach, creation of cancer screening navigation  programs that increase patient engagement and improve access to and completion of cancer screening tests,  and recruitment of a cadre of patient navigators for common diseases in our catchment area affecting  minorities, including lung, colorectal and breast cancer, in order to assist patients from all backgrounds in  getting into our health care system and using it effectively. Children with cancer have traditionally had a very  high participation rate in clinical research studies with the field of pediatric oncology often at the forefront of  cancer clinical research. The ACC Pediatric Oncology Program has played a central role locally and nationally  in improving our understanding of the biology of childhood cancers through the collection and study of human  tumor specimens, and in advancing our knowledge of optimal treatments by conducting clinical trials and  playing a very notable leadership role in national pediatric cooperative group and clinical research consortia."
"9126270","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death in the United States (US) and is one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Recently obesity rates have reached a plateau in the US but have yet to begin to decrease. The physical consequences of overweight and especially obesity can be serious and life- threatening. Diet and physical inactivity are the two major determinants of overweight/obesity and need to be addressed on a population-wide scale for positive changes to occur. Individual behavior change programs have been slow and recidivism has been great. It is increasingly understood that our physical and social environments play a large role in influencing diet and physical activity. The mission of the Tulane PRC (T/PRC), therefore, is to identify and address the physical and social environmental factors influencing obesity and its behavioral determinants (physical activity and diet) through: participatory research focusing on these factors and ways to modify them; collaboration with community partners and policymakers; communication about and dissemination of this research with researchers, public health practitioners, policy-makers, community partners, and the general public; training of students, faculty, public health professionals, organizational partners and community members; maintaining a stable Infrastructure with adequate resources and personnel with appropriate training, experience and expertise along with strong institutional support. The previous two funding cycles of the T/PRC have demonstrated our ability to develop and maintain the key elements of the T/PRC which enable us to conduct the work consistent with our mission, goals and objectives. We are proposing an applied public health intervention research that will address physical and social factors within one intervention neighborhood in New Orleans, the 9th Ward, and compare it to a non-intervention neighborhood, New Orleans East. The overall goal is to conduct applied public health intervention research that will produce sustainable environmental and social improvements in New Orleans' underserved minority neighborhoods and result in increased healthy weight-related behaviors and reduction/prevention of obesity. The primary aim is to reduce Body Mass Index by 1.5% within overweight and obese categories. Multiple strategies will be employed to determine the collective impact on an identified neighborhood with well-defined boundaries, but with enough differences within the neighborhood to determine characteristics of the best setting for maximum impact. A core cohort will be recruited for pre and post assessments, and neighborhood observations will occur for estimate of population-wide use of physical activity and fresh produce venues."
"9286808","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this highly-integrated and multi-disciplinary Center without Walls entitled ?Identifying genes and pathways that modulate tau toxicity in FTD?, we seek to discover novel genetic modifiers of tauopathy to provide unique insight into disease mechanisms, as well as support the development and validation of an innovative approach to measure tau burden in patients using plasma samples. Taking advantage of the genome sequencing data available from PSP patients, Project 1 will identify genetic variants that influence disease risk, and in collaboration with the Human Biology Validation Core determine how key variants are associated with tau burden. As a complementary but alternative approach to identify genetic modifiers, Project 2 will utilize the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mouse strains developed at Jax Labs to uncover genetic variants that determine sensitivity or resistance to AAV-induced tauopathy. Project 3 will investigate the hypothesis that assessment of plasma tau levels following the administration of anti-tau antibodies provides a sensitive and specific biomarker for tau aggregation in the brain, employing samples from both murine models of tauopathy as well as patients enrolled in ARTFL and LEFFTDS. Project 4 will construct a disease signature for FTD-tau and mine public databases and systems analyses to predict pharmacologic and/or genetic interventions to reverse the signature, as well as elucidate how genetic modifiers identified in Projects 1 and 2 impact tau metabolism and secretion. The four research projects will be supported by the Administrative Core (Core A), the Viral Production and Cloning Core (Core B), the Human Biology Validation Core (Core C), and the Data Coordination Core (Core D). We envision that at the conclusion of the funding period, we will have: (i) identified key genes that determine either sensitivity or resistance to tau-mediated neurodegeneration; (ii) developed a sensitive and specific blood-based biomarker for tau deposition in the brain; (iii) discovered novel therapeutic targets predicted to reverse the transcriptional signature that defines tau mutation carriers; and (iv) determined how tau mutations and genetic modifiers of tauopathy impact tau metabolism, protein homeostasis and cell viability. Therefore, our Center is uniquely poised to enable the identification of patient populations at risk, while simultaneously enhancing diagnostic capabilities and expanding therapeutic possibilities."
"9175028","Personality traits have emerged as important predictors of health outcomes, including mortality risk. Recent findings, including our own from the previous project period, also show that health behaviors such as smoking and substance use are important mediators of the personality-health association. These prior findings can be enhanced, deepened and translated in 3 ways. First, dynamic modeling of longitudinal personality and health data can deepen our understanding of the association between the two. Second, replicability, reproducibility and cumulative science in personality and health can be enhanced through the use of multiple data sets in an Integrated Data Analysis (IDA) format. Third, extension of this work toward health care utilization outcomes can help translate research on personality and health into useful tools that health care providers can utilize. In this competing renewal, we propose to do each of these three. We request support for further data analyses within the Boston VA Normative Aging Study (NAS), as well as to obtain one more wave of longitudinal data (Aim 1). Recognizing that the NAS is rapidly decreasing in size due to high mean age and increased mortality, we are also requesting support to expand our studies to 13 other longitudinal studies that are part of the IALSA, or Integrated Analysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging (Aim 2). This will transition our research program toward a large group of ongoing longitudinal studies. It will also enhance replicability of our findings through use of multiple datasets. Lastly, we will move to a translational focus by conducting studies of personality and health care utilization (Aim 3). We believe each of our aims are significant and have high health relevance, and in concert they will lead to enhanced knowledge of how personality can affect health, mortality, and health care outcomes."
"9070807","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment is perhaps the major contributor to human disease, yet its effect is largely ignored in whole genome approaches to genetics. In this CEGS, we will attack head-on the mechanisms through which environment influences genomic function, focusing on two extremely important exposures highly relevant to human health: diet and its relationship to metabolic disease and cancer; and stress related to neuropsychiatric disease. This requires nearly complete control of the experimental system in a way that cannot be done in humans. Our first aim is develop a new foundational experimental mouse model for understanding gene-environment interaction (GxE). We will expose crosses of the genetically heterogeneous Collaborative Cross population of mice to three well-controlled diets - Western, Mediterranean, ketogenic - and measure phenotypes across organ systems representing metabolic and cardiovascular disease. We will also determine the effects of diet on azoxymethane-induced colon tumors; as well as stress on phenotypes relevant to neuropsychiatric disease. We will couple these analyses to whole genome bisulfite sequencing, chromatin accessibility analysis and transcriptomics of target tissues including liver, adipose tissue, colon, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and blood, measuring the nature and flow of information among environment, genome, epigenome, and transcriptome in determining phenotype. Our second aim is to develop new statistical methods as well as a novel mathematical framework for handling the interaction between genetics, epigenetics, and exposure, which will allow us to model how information is passed between these three domains to ultimately shape phenotype. These methods include causal inference testing, analysis of genomically discontiguous genotype-epigenotype relationships, and novel stochastic approaches based on fundamental concepts of statistical physics and information theory. Our third aim is to perform replication in naïve animals and in highly relevant human epidemiologic cohorts: DWH and ALSPAC for diet exposures and metabolic disorders; NHSII and EPIC for diet and colon cancer; and ALSPAC and PIRC for stress and behavioral traits. Our fourth aim is to develop and promulgate new measurement, analytical, and computational technologies for comprehensive genomic analysis of GxE. These include new biological resources and software packages, as well as biochemical, cellular and computational tools to test and improve the models and conclusions from the other Aims, and of broad general use to the genomics community, including: analysis of single or multiple marks for determining long-range GxE relationships; single cell and in situ analysis of gene expression and epigenetic modifications; and novel computational approaches including ultrafast alignment of large datasets. This highly interdisciplinary proposal involves completely novel combinations of mouse genomics, statistical physics, biostatistics, computer science, biochemistry, epidemiology, and single cell analysis, in order to understand the essential question of how genomic function is shaped by the environment."
"9256780","Despite successful control of HIV with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-infected patients continue to harbor HIV in their brain and are at risk for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). This is in part due to the incomplete CNS penetrations by cART. However, cART toxicity to the brain tissue is also associated with HAND. Therefore, novel therapy is necessary to treat HIV in the CNS without causing toxicity. Recently, a new broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) against HIV, PGT121, was shown to achieve control of viral replication in the blood of simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected Rhesus monkeys. However, only limited quantity of PGT121 penetrates through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB); and it is also not known if PGT121 retains its functions in the CNS environment. Our overall goal is to reduce viral load in the CSN by re-engineer PGT121 for better penetration through the BBB. We will create a bispecific antibody where PGT121 is one arm of the antibody and the other arm binds the human transferrin receptor (HTfR) on the BBB to facilitate active transcytosis (PGT121/anti-HTfR Ab). The central hypothesis is that intravenous infusion with PGT121/anti-HTfR Ab will specifically target HIV in the CNS. Our Preliminary Data demonstrated distinct CSF IgG profile, detection of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in the brain early after intrarectal infection in rhesus monkeys, and that less than 0.2% of intravenously infused PGT121 enters the CSF, which is below the threshold for efficacy. We posit that re-engineering PGT121 as a bispecific antibody (PGT121/anti-HTfR Ab) to efficiently across the BBB will treat HAND by reducing viral load without the cART-associated toxicity. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1.) Re-engineer mAb PGT121 as a bispecific Ab for improved CNS penetration. 2.) Determine preliminary efficacy and safety of bispecific PGT121/anti-HTfR Ab in SHIV-infected rhesus monkeys. 3.) Reduce SHIV replication in CNS reservoirs of infected rhesus monkeys with bispecific PGT121/anti- HTfR Ab. To achieve these, the Tan lab will continue our ongoing collaboration with the Reimann lab in generating and testing the bispecific antibody PGT121/anti-HTfR Ab in Aim 1. The non-human primate studies in Aims 2 and 3 were developed and will be carried out in collaboration between the Tan and Barouch labs. The development of novel tools such as the bispecific antibody will pave the way for the discovery of new therapeutics for eradication of HIV from the CNS. This proposed work will expand our understanding of antibody-mediated responses within the CNS, and create new therapeutic interventions targeting HIV in the CNS."
"9131441","Project Summary Environmental toxins and microglia-synapse interactions in autism. It is increasingly evident that diverse genes and environmental exposure(s) combine or synergize to produce a spectrum of autism phenotypes dependent upon critical developmental windows. Multiple prenatal/maternal environmental toxins and exposures have been linked to human ASDs, but the associations of single agents have been relatively weak. This suggests it is the combination of multiple maternal exposures that increases vulnerability in offspring. We now recognize that non-chemical stressors, such as limited resources or social support of the mother, can increase vulnerability of the fetus to chemical stressor exposures (e.g., pollution or toxins), which could explain why a single exposure or risk factor in isolation is a modest predictor of autism risk. Models aimed at deciphering the mechanisms that contribute to ASD suffer from oversimplification, using single agents. We breach this gap by using a new model that employs the combined effects of an ethologically relevant maternal stressor and environmentally relevant pollutant, diesel exhaust, both of which have been implicated in autism. We show that maternal diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure combined with maternal stress (MS) (but neither in isolation) produces early-life communication deficits, and long-term cognitive deficits and strikingly increased anxiety in male but not female offspring. We show evidence that DEP exposure significantly alters microglial colonization of the male but not female embryonic brain, and combined prenatal DEP and MS exposure leads to persistent changes in the function of microglia of the same brain regions of males. Beyond their functions in innate immune defense of the brain, microglia are important regulators of experience-dependent synaptic remodeling during development. It is proposed that microglia prune inappropriate or weak synapses while sparing appropriate or strong connections. Autism has been well described as a disease of synaptic dysfunction, and functional network analyses have nearly all pointed out the importance of molecular pathways that control activity-dependent synaptic remodeling in the pathology of ASDs. Importantly, impaired microglia-mediated pruning in mice disrupts functional brain connectivity and social behavior, strongly suggesting that microglia-synapse interactions may contribute to autism?s pathophysiology. Thus, the specific hypothesis to be tested here is that microglial activation by combined environmental factors will cause aberrant synaptic pruning by these cells, leading to neural circuit dysfunction and ASD-like behaviors."
"9217348","Neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a key role in motor learning, and neurological diseases that affect VTA neurons or their targets in the basal ganglia (BG) severely disrupt behavior. Notably, much of our understanding of how the VTA functions in motor learning has relied on paradigms that employ external reward or punishment and involve relatively slow and simple behaviors, such as lever pressing or licking. In contrast, many of our most complex and valued behaviors, such as speech and musical expression, can be learned without external reinforcement, suggesting that their learning is internally reinforced. Further, internally reinforced behaviors such as speech or musicianship require highly complex and rapid motor sequences and are more readily acquired during juvenile sensitive periods. How the VTA interacts with the BG to mediate complex forms of internally and externally reinforced auditory-motor learning remains unknown. Here we propose to identify how the VTA and BG interact to mediate different forms of auditory-motor learning using a novel combination of intersectional genetic methods to selectively ablate VTA neurons, microdialysis, calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation of VTA terminals and BG neurons combined with rapid and temporally precise behavioral manipulations. These approaches will be used to test the hypothesis that the VTA functions as a ?critic? that evaluates auditory feedback and instructively modifies BG premotor activity, which in turn drives internally and externally reinforced auditory- motor learning. Resolving how VTA-BG circuits mediate these forms of learning are critical issues for understanding motor plasticity in health and disease. In fact, speech pathologies typify various diseases that affect VTA-BG circuitry, while mutations that disrupt dopamine-mediated signaling in the BG also impair vocal learning. Therefore, the proposed research can shed light on the neural circuit mechanisms that enable complex internally and externally reinforced behavioral learning while also revealing how dysfunction in these circuits interferes with the learning and execution of communicative behaviors."
"9142276","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As chronic illnesses progress over time, patients experience clinical status changes that require care transitions across health care settings or to new phases of care. All transitions present opportunities for high quality patient-centered care; however, in practice many care transitions are poorly managed and many decisions do not respect patient values or take available evidence into account. This application proposes to develop a center for patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) at the University of Missouri (MU) with a thematic focus on improving patient care transitions across health care settings or from one phase of care to another. To build long-term sustainability for conducting patient-centered outcomes research the MU Center will: (1) develop MU's capabilities in PCOR by mentoring investigators, supporting pilot studies, providing research training, and new hiring; (2) foster development of skills and capabilities to work with large data sets using advanced analytic methods to study comparative treatment effectiveness; (3) build research expertise on practice-changing interventions to support care transitions; and (4) engage stakeholders through focus groups, a patient advisory panel, and a novel social networking and tailored messaging platform that facilitates information gathering, feedback from participants to investigators, and dissemination. The MU Center will also develop digital infrastructure to support data collection and analysis, test novel research designs, and facilitate building a regional vascular surgery registry. The three associated projects will include patients with ischemic limbs undergoing an inpatient procedure, patients transitioning from skilled nursing facilities to the community, and patients receiving or being considered for opioid therapy for chronic pain in primary care practices in the American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network. They will enhance the Center's expertise in using large data sets and developing strategies for practice change while engaging stakeholders both to improve the research and to facilitate its dissemination and implementation. The MU Center will be supported by strong internal and external advisors, and the application proposes a robust evaluation process."
"9132354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetically-engineered mice are currently being developed for in vivo studies of brain development and a wide range of neurodevelopmental diseases. Indeed, defined mutant mice have been critical for identifying the affected genetic pathways and addressing the underlying cellular and molecular basis of developmental brain diseases. Lacking in these efforts have been effective in vivo imaging methods that can be used to study mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, especially during early postnatal stages when disease is first manifested, and the greatest changes in brain structure and function are likely to occur. A major challenge is therefore to develop and validate in vivo imaging techniques that can detect and monitor early changes in brain structure and function in the developing mouse brain. We have established quantitative, in vivo manganese (Mn)-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) approaches for analyzing the early postnatal mouse brain, showing that MEMRI provides an exquisitely sensitive method for revealing multiple nuclei and axonal tracts in the early postnatal mouse brain. Results from our laboratory and others have already proven the utility of MEMRI for assessing neural activity and connectivity. These new findings now point to the potential of MEMRI for in vivo detection and quantitative analysis of functional circuits in the developing mouse brain. We have also discovered that the Divalent Metal Transporter, DMT1 can be utilized as an effective reporter gene for MEMRI. We now propose to develop and test a combination of DMT1 expression with MEMRI to provide a precise in vivo approach to analyze functional connectivity in the mouse brain, starting from critical neonatal stages when the circuitry is first established. We will test this new imaging technology in mice with mutations in the mid-hindbrain (MHB) genes engrailed (En1 and En2) and Fgf17, which have morphological and functional cerebellum and midbrain phenotypes. Recent evidence also suggests that both En and Fgf17 mutant mice have defects in MHB circuitry. We will therefore use DMT1-MEMRI to study MHB circuitry in these mice during the critical postnatal period of brain development. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Determine the normal stage-dependent MEMRI intensities in defined nuclei in wildtype (WT), En and Fgf17 mutant mice; 2) Utilize DMT1 to genetically label defined nuclei for MEMRI analysis of midbrain and cerebellar circuits; and 3) Analyze differences in functional circuitry between WT, En and Fgf17 mouse mutants using DMT1-MEMRI. This research has high potential to establish an innovative, genetically-controlled form of MEMRI for in vivo analysis of circuits in the developing mouse brain, providing critical new tools for analyzing mouse models of a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders, including cerebellum hypoplasia syndromes (e.g., Joubert and Dandy-Walker syndromes), autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia."
"9243844","PROJECT SUMMARY Infertility and pregnancy loss are common health disorders affecting women. Uterine glands have important biological roles in fertility, dysplasia and disease. Pregnancy loss is the most common complication of human gestation, and recurrent pregnancy loss and infertility are observed in uterine gland knockout animal models. Uterine glandular epithelia (GE) and, by inference, their secretions have biological roles in uterine receptivity, blastocyst/conceptus survival and implantation, and stromal cell decidualization- all essential processes for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. However, uterine gland biology research is hampered by the lack of suitable mouse models to conditionally delete or overexpress genes specifically in the GE of the adult uterus. The goal of this proposal is to address that problem. Prss29 (protease, serine 29 or implantation serine proteinase gene two) is a gene expressed robustly and specifically after puberty in the GE of the adult mouse uterus and not in other female reproductive tract tissues. In Aim 1, improved Cre recombinase (iCre) will be inserted into the 3? untranslated region of the Prss29 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Activity and cell-specific expression of iCre will be determined in the developing and adult tissues using Rosa26 reporter mice. Aim 2 is to establish and validate the usefulness of Prss29- iCre mice for study of adult uterine gland function. Forkhead box a2 (Foxa2) is specifically expressed in the GE of the adult mouse and human uterus and has a potential biological role in regulation of ovarian steroid hormone responsive genes and GE function during pregnancy. Prss29-iCre mice will be used to conditionally delete Foxa2 in the adult uterus and determine its impact on fertility and pregnancy. Prss29-iCre mice will be used in conjuction with RiboTag mice to isolate actively translated mRNAs, which will be sequenced to uncover the GE active transcriptome of pregnancy. This application specifically targets NIH program announcement PA-13-303 entitled ?NIH Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant Program (Parent R21)? that encourages research grant applications to support the early and conceptual stages of a project. At the conclusion of these studies, we expect to have generated a novel mouse model useful for the study of uterine gland biology, regeneration, and disease and fill a significant gap in our existing knowledge of uterine gland function during pregnancy."
"9349018","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immune-mediated glomerular disorders represent the third-most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for 14% of the dialysis population. IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (SLE-N) are the leading causes of primary and secondary immune-complex glomerular diseases. There are significant ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence and outcomes of these disorders. In particular, black and Hispanic patients are significantly more likely to progress to ESRD than whites across the spectrum of these glomerulopathies. These disparities are not solely attributable to environmental or socioeconomic factors. Recent studies, including from our group, have begun to delineate the contribution of genetic factors to variation in prevalence rates and renal outcomes in numerous glomerular diseases. The goal of this application is to systematically determine the degree to which genetic risk factors account for ethnicity-specific variation in prevalence, disease course, and overall outcomes of IgAN, MN, and SLE-N. In Aim 1, we will enrich our bio repository for specimens of glomerular disease patients with (a) preferential recruitment of black and Hispanic patients with IgAN, MN, and SLE-N and (b) DNA extraction from 3,000 anonymized kidney biopsy samples of these diseases. In Aim 2, we will use this bio repository to establish ethnicity-specific normative value for emerging biomarkers in IgAN, MN, and SLE-N that, to date, have primarily been tested in European and Asian populations. In Aim 3, we will incorporate genetic and biomarker data to better define differences in disease presentation and outcomes among ethnic/racial populations. We anticipate that there will be both distinct and shared genetic risk factors between both the subpopulations (Europeans, Asians, Hispanics, and African-Americans) and immune-mediated diseases under study. These findings will help identify individuals at high risk of IgAN, MN, and SLE-N; more precisely define the role of socio-economic and environmental cofactors in disease phenotypes; allow for discovery of new therapeutic interventions across the spectrum of immune-mediated diseases; and, finally, serve as an important resource for future investigations into the pathophysiology of these immune-mediated kidney diseases."
"9169125","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cancer cells constantly fight and win a myriad of battles brought on by their surrounding microenvironment in the form of hypoxia, nutrient shortage, immunological attack and anti-cancer agents. Key to this resilience is the extraordinary ability of cancer cells to rapidly evolve their internal composition and organization through a combination of genetic, epigenetic and posttranslational mechanisms. However, after decades of studies, our knowledge of the mechanisms that mediate cancer cell remodeling remains fragmentary. Most importantly, a major challenge is to map the sequence of events that punctuate the life cycle of a tumor as it evolves from early to late stage disease within its host organism. The centerpiece of this proposal is the development of a novel genetically engineered mouse model (`iMAOS' - in vivo Mass spectrometry Analysis of Organelle Substrates), that enables tracking of changes in protein composition in a tumor cell as it progresses through sequential stages of malignant transformation within its host tissue. Specifically, iMAOS will allow us to test the role of lysosome-mediated degradation as a novel, previously unrecognized driving force in cancer proteome remodeling. Our recent work has challenged the long-held perception of the lysosome as a cellular `dead end' devoid of regulation and incapable of imparting substrate selectivity. Instead we have shown that autophagosomes (specialized organelles that mediate `self-catabolism') and lysosomes are subject to sophisticated transcriptional co-regulation in highly aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells, leading to increased tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found that lysosomes selectively digest vast quantities of protein in preference to lipid, carbohydrate or nucleic acid species in PDA cells. These results imply that a key function of the autophagy-lysosome system is to profoundly remodel the proteome of PDA cells during their transition from a normal to malignant state. However, identifying the protein species targeted for lysosome-mediated removal in a stage-specific manner, is unsuited to conventional proteomics-based approaches, which measure overall changes in cellular protein content at the cost of spatial and often temporal detail. In contrast, our new genetic model of pancreatic cancer will enable stage-specific and site-specific identification of proteins targeted for degradation through incorporation of cancer cell-specific fluorescent probes and affinity handles for organelle purification and quantitative proteomics analysis. We will capture alterations in the PDA proteome as it evolves in a living host in two dimensions 1) temporal analysis during the course of tumor progression from early to late stage disease and 2) spatial analysis comparing whole cell proteomic changes to those specific to an organelle compartment ? the lysosome ? using a single mouse model system. By systematically combining time-resolved lysosomal proteomics with high throughput functional screens, we will begin to dissect the key pathways and players that enable selective protein turnover during PDA development and thus identify new therapeutically relevant targets for drug development. More broadly, we anticipate that our elegant model system for simultaneous cell isolation and organelle profiling in vivo will be a powerful tool in the study of normal homeostatic processes and additional disease settings where alterations in proteostasis and lysosome function have been implicated. These include normal states of tissue differentiation and developmental, as well as in neurodegenerative disease, lysosome storage disorders, other cancers and aging, thus providing unprecedented insights into the role and regulation of lysosomal catabolism in vivo and highlighting the value and applicability of our proposal to the broader scientific community."
"9143749","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Palliative care and hospice focus on the relief of suffering and achieving the best possible quality of life, including ameliorating symptoms, relieving psychological distress, and promoting spiritual well-being for patients their caregivers. The growth of palliative care programs and services in the United States has paralleled the increased realization of the need for a rational, specialized approach to the care for people with advanced life-limiting chronic illness. A relatively new subspecialty, palliative care is building ts evidence base supporting clinical practice. A new National Institute of Nursing Research funded national research network, the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC), is an efficient mechanism for evidence development including comparative effectiveness research. The fundamental next step is efficient implementation of new evidence and emerging clinical care guidelines into practice. Quality monitoring and performance improvement initiatives are an important approach to reinforce evidence implementation. Over the past 5 years, a regional point-of-care quality monitoring program called QDACT-PC has been developed and piloted in North Carolina; it has been demonstrated to be well-liked by clinicians, usable, feasible, and able to generate reliable information that can be used to benchmark conformance with palliative care quality metrics, drive continuous quality improvement (CQI) activities, and reinforce best practice. One example of low conformance with quality metrics identified in QDACT-PC was related to constipation management; data demonstrate that less than 50% of patients are receiving current best practice interventions to manage constipation and that the symptom is persisting at moderate to severe levels until death.  We propose to introduce QDACT-PC within engaged research and clinical care footprint of the PCRC to create a national network for point-of-care palliative care quality monitoring, and demonstrate its capabilities for conducting CQI projects and reinforcing contemporary standards for clinical best practice. Specific aims of the project include: (1) To develop and nationally implement a PCRC specific version of QDACT-PC (named QDACT-PCRC). Upgrades planned for QDACT-PCRC include the addition of new data elements and question modules about caregivers, clinical sites characteristics, hospital-based palliative care, and questions relevant to Aims 2 and 3. (2) To demonstrate the use of QDACT-PCRC for CQI by conducting a network-wide CQI project in constipation management. QDACT-PCRC will be used to benchmark current conformance across all sites. PCRC clinical providers will develop a performance improvement program to address the symptom and its management. We will use QDACT-PCRC to monitor impact of the initiative, implementing iterative enhancements to the performance improvement program in order to achieve a goal of >90% conformance. (3) To test the use QDACT-PCRC as a mechanism for delivering clinical decision support that reinforces agreed best clinical practice. Palliative Medicine has recently proposed five clinical activities that should not be conducted as a part of ABIM's Choosing Wisely campaign (e.g. PEG tubes at end of life). We will use QDACT-PCRC to measure current rates of these activities being conducted at PCRC sites, to deliver a point- of-care real time education and clinical decision support module to reinforce best practice and to monitor impact, with iterative cycles of system updates as needed based upon impact. The expected outcome of this project is a national system of real-time point-of-care quality monitoring for palliative care, wit demonstrated capabilities to support CQI and implementation of best evidence. A corollary outcome is an aggregating dataset of quality monitoring and clinical implementation information, forming the PCRC Registry - intended to be a national resource to support quality monitoring, research and learning health care."

"9253948","Project Summary Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) admit ~450,000 babies every year in the U.S. The monitoring of arterial blood gases is essential for managing any sick infant, but especially important in vulnerable, extremely premature infants, for whom even a minimal delay in appropriate interventions can be the difference between life and death. Intermittent monitoring of blood gases, as is traditional, provides only a spot check of physio-pathological status; the results are often delayed from the actual event triggering blood gas analysis, and the procedure, besides predisposing to iatrogenic infections, in itself is painful and over time can result in significant blood loss. Continuous non-invasive blood gas monitoring is preferable, but current non-invasive continuous modalities have significant limitations. An accurate, precise, and intrinsically safe system that exploits routinely performed intravascular catheterization (such as umbilical artery catheterization ? the standard of care for sick neonates) to obtain blood gas measurements continuously would be an important advance in monitoring critically ill neonates in NICUs. To address this need, we are developing an integrated fiber optic sensor umbilical (ISUM) catheter for blood gas monitoring in neonates. The ISUM catheter will fill the technological gap in continuous blood analysis by addressing the deficiencies shown in classical intravascular sensor probes, and will take advantage of the fact that most critically sick newborns in NICUs receive at least one intravascular catheter, often an umbilical arterial catheter. The sensor and the catheter are designed as an integrated unit for this specific application, and have the following advantages over previously described intravascular probes: (1) novel large area gas sensors, eliminating probe placement or movement artifacts; (2) dual O2 sensor and data fusion, eliminating wall effect, and improving reliability; and (3) ready-to-use sensors, with little or no delay in data acquisition; and (4) reduced cost, since highly repeatable sensor elements can be produced in batches of hundreds. In Phase I, the first ISUM catheters were designed, fabricated, and tested in animal models, incorporating sensors for both pO2 and pCO2. Excellent correlation between sensor readings and the gold standard technique for blood gas analysis was observed. None of the erroneous readings associated with prior intravascular devices were observed (which highlights the potential of the novel sensors for use in both infants and adults), and the safety of the new catheter was demonstrated. In the proposed Phase II work, additional sensors will be integrated, and advanced catheters will be designed and validated in the laboratory and in neonatal animal models closer to humans, which will lead to initial validation in human subjects. As soon as the proposed milestones are achieved, we will move to commercialize the ISUM catheter by starting the process for an FDA 510 (k) submission, and negotiating with investors for clinical trials and commercialization."
"9080392","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The availability of next-generation sequencing data in large-scale association studies provides a unique research opportunity. The data contains the information that is required to identify causal disease susceptibility loci (DSL) for many mental health phenotypes and psychiatric diseases. In order to translate the wealth of information into DSL discovery, powerful statistical methodology is required. So far, a large number of rare variant association tests have been proposed. However, they do not incorporate all the important information about the variants. So far, none of the existing approaches takes the physical location of the variant into account. Under the assumption that deleterious DSLs and protective DSLs cluster in different genomic regions, we will develop a general association analysis framework that is built on spatial clustering approaches. The framework will be able to handle complex phenotypes, e.g. binary, quantitative, etc., and be applicable to different study designs, i.e. family-based studies and designs of unrelated subjects. If the DSLs cluster indeed, the increase of statistical power of the approach will be of practical relevance, enabling the discovery of DSLs. In the absence of DSL clustering, our approach will achieve similar power levels as existing methodology. Furthermore, in order to test larger genomic regions for association, we will develop network-based association methodology. The network-based approach will have sufficient power for larger genomic region than existing approaches, and, at the same time, provide an intuitive understanding of the complex relationships between the variants that drive the association, fostering new biological insights. The approach can incorporate complex phenotypes and different design types. We will also use the information about the physical locations of the rare variants to detect population substructure/admixture. Since rare variants are genetically much younger than common variants, approaches that take the physical locations of the variants and their clustering into account will provide a much finer resolution picture of population substructure in sequence data than existing approaches, e.g., EIGENSTRAT. We will use community-detection algorithm for the classification of study subjects in genetic homogenously subgroups. All the proposed methodology will be implemented in user- friendly software packages with existing user-communities, i.e. PBAT, NPBAT and R."
"9152400","Project Summary  The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and regulation of the calcium pump (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, SERCA) in the heart. SERCA clears cytosolic Ca2+ in cardiomyocytes, thus playing a central role in Ca2+ regulation in the heart. SERCA is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), a 52-residue phosphorylation-regulated membrane protein that inhibits the activity of the pump. A key molecular dysfunction in heart failure (HF) involves impaired Ca2+ transport during diastole, usually associated with insufficient SERCA expression and unaltered PLB levels, thus yielding lower SERCA activity due to PLB inhibition. Therefore, there is an urgent need for time-resolved, atomistic characterization of SERCA activation and SERCA-PLB regulation to understand the molecular basis of Ca2+ dysregulation, and to design appropriate approaches to HF. These mechanisms are complex, requiring structural changes and interdomain allosteric communication pathways that are difficult to determine experimentally. Since complete experimental characterization of these changes is likely to remain an intractable problem, we propose to use molecular simulations as a complementary approach. The central hypothesis of this project is that molecular simulations at appropriate spatiotemporal scales are uniquely suited to provide a time-resolved detection of SERCA mechanisms and regulation at a level of resolution currently inaccessible through experiments alone. The high-resolution mechanistic information from these studies can be directly used for computer-aided discovery of hits that activate SERCA through specifically targeting the SERCA-PLB interaction. To verify and consolidate these hypotheses, we have developed a robust battery of computational biophysics and virtual high-throughput screening approaches to SERCA and SERCA-PLB. Three Specific Aims will be pursued: (1) Map ligand-induced structural changes associated with SERCA activation. (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms for PLB regulation of SERCA. (3) Perform a structure-based search of hits that activate SERCA. For this project, we focus on skeletal SERCA1a because crystal structures have been obtained only for this isoform, but the structural results from our simulations are directly applicable to cardiac SERCA2a because there are no significant differences in the kinetics and function of both isoforms, including regulation by PLB. The simulation work will be closely coupled to experimental studies through collaborations; the combination of structural and functional data will provide the experimental tests necessary to verify our simulations and refine our structural models. Activation of SERCA is a widely pursued therapeutic goal in heart failure, and this project has great potential for pushing important frontiers in our understanding of SERCA function and regulation, ultimately enabling a more rational approach to address a critical problem in human health."
"9145644","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most of the causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality result from participation in health risk behaviors, such as alcohol and other drug use, smoking, sexual activity without use of protection against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, and unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity. These behaviors frequently begin during adolescence and then persist into adulthood, thereby also influencing adult health, disease, disability, healthcare burden, and premature death. In recognition of the impact of these behaviors on adolescent and adult health, professional practice guidelines from multiple organizations recommend that Primary Care Providers screen for these behaviors and provide counseling aimed at prevention and risk reduction. Despite these recommendations and the fact that over 70% of adolescents are seen in primary care each year, adolescents with health risk behaviors are underidentified in primary care settings, and are seldom provided with risk reduction counseling or follow up interventions to decrease their risks. To address this gap in recommended care, we propose to develop and test a web-based interactive Health Assessment (iHA) for implementation in primary care settings prior to adolescent healthcare visits. The iHA is designed to: 1) conduct multi-risk screening; 2) provide personalized youth-focused prevention and risk reduction feedback; 3) summarize results, in addition to youth-reported risk behaviors, goals, and consequences for Primary Care Providers (PCPs) in order to stimulate patient-provider discussions; and 4) provide decision support for PCPs in determining the next appropriate steps in care. Personalized feedback (component #2 above) is an innovative feature of this proposed intervention, as it has demonstrated robust effectiveness in reducing risky drinking among young adults, but has not yet been tested with adolescents, nor extrapolated to health behaviors beyond substance use in healthcare settings. Health areas covered by the iHA include alcohol, tobacco and drug use; physical activity; diet; sexual health; and safety. The proposed study will recruit a sample of adolescents aged 13-18 from six primary care clinics. In Phase 1, we will optimize the iHA design and content based on formal usability testing with adolescents and primary care providers, and will develop implementation processes and training materials to promote seamless integration of iHA in primary care settings. In Phase 2, we conduct a randomized, controlled trial with 300 adolescents to examine the efficacy of this iHA on increasing the provision of prevention and risk reduction counseling during the healthcare visit, and on reducing a variety of adolescent health risk behaviors at 1 and 6 month follow ups, relative to usual care."

"9216715","PROJECT SUMMARY Social interaction and communication begin in early infancy, and, although these are fundamental human functions, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms that regulate them particularly in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant disabilities in language and social skills, and the specific neural mechanisms that lead to these disabilities remain active topics for investigation. Emerging theoretical directions converge on problems with eye-contact as a salient component of these communication and social disabilities. Technical limitations, however, associated with imaging of two or more individuals during natural communication and mutual eye contact have been a primary obstacle to these investigations. To overcome this technical impasse, we employ a rapidly developing brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) allowing simultaneous neural imaging of two individuals during valid interactions to observe the neural effects of eye-to-eye contact and actual dialogue. Functional NIRS detects active neural tissue based on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal by measuring variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, they are relatively insensitive to head movement, and, as such, fNIRS is well suited for investigations of neural events engaged during active interpersonal interactions between two participants. The neural mechanisms that underlie atypical interpersonal interactions and eye contact in adult ASD are the focus of this proposal. Pilot studies confirm the feasibility of all aspects of this research project. Dyads consisting of a confederate and a participants with typical development (TYP) or ASD will be compared during neuroimaging while engaged in natural interaction and communication. We introduce a computational approach based on wavelet analysis to quantify regional cross-brain coherence between the two participants and hypothesize that cross-brain coherence associated with speech and eye contact will be reduced in ASD relative to the TYP cohort. Cross-brain computations also form the basis for a model of dynamic neural processes based on neural ?send and receive? functions during communication. We hypothesize that these dynamic ?cross-brain communication? systems unify and coordinate the roles of language production and reception (Broca's and Wernicke's Areas), respectively, with visual reception involving face specializations (fusiform gyrus). Computational comparison of cross-brain connectivity effects as well as conventional functional connectivity and segregation/contrast effects during live communication both with and without direct eye contact provides a transformational technical, empirical, computational, and theoretical advance toward understanding the dynamic neural mechanisms associated with social and communication disabilities in ASD."
"9095845","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes."
"9252778","Project Summary  Deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain represents a universal feature Alzheimer?s disease pathology and precedes clinical symptoms by several years. Currently, diagnosis of amyloid-associated dementias in individuals showing symptoms of cognitive decline is extremely difficult, requiring multiple modes of testing over months to years. Early, pre-symptomatic diagnosis is even more challenging, if not impossible, with currently available technology. A non-invasive method for diagnosing Alzheimer?s disease is greatly needed.  We will further evaluate the use of AMDX-201, a novel fluorescent probe that can label amyloids in tissue, as a diagnostic for Alzheimer?s disease. AMDX-201 has been shown to fluorescently label AD-related deposits in vivo. Importantly, this probe has also been shown to effectively image amyloid deposits in the retina of AD- mice following both topical and intravenous dosing. The properties of AMDX-201 are ideal for its development as a topical diagnostic probe for AD. The studies outlined in this proposal advance AMDX-201 to the Pre-IND stage. The synthesis of AMDX-201 will be optimized through dedicated process development activities. A formulation effective for topical administration in humans will be developed along with in vivo evaluation of diagnostic efficacy in two species of animals. Further, the retinal images obtained throughout formulation development will be utilized to develop a method to quantify the number, size and intensity of amyloid deposits. Together, the aims of this proposal will result in an optimized diagnostic product capable of imaging AD in the retina. The diagnostic product will be advanced to the point of being ready for IND-enabling Toxicology studies."
"9145181","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with advanced cancer face challenges affecting quality of life (QOL). As the National Cancer Policy Board has identified, research addressing the needs of patients with incurable cancers is severely deficient and effectiveness has rarely been displayed by prospective trials. Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common problem for advanced cancer patients that involves considerable suffering. There are two major treatment approaches for MBO: surgical management and medical management with specific classes of medications. There is little evidence-based information to choose the optimal clinical care for most patients with a MBO. Goals for these patients may include the ability to eat, relief of nausea, pain control, being at home, and along with an increase in survival. Treatments may improve QOL outcomes in many, but there is no consistent measure defining improvement. The aim of this study is to compare the current treatment algorithms of surgical and non-surgical approaches to MBO in terms of minimizing days in hospital and improving QOL. This will be a five-year multi-site prospective comparative effectiveness study of patients who are admitted to the hospital with an MBO. We have devised a mixed-design study of a smaller randomized population and a larger observational cohort to ensure validity of observational results while enabling adequate accrual. To accomplish this goal we will need to accrue 180 patients (50 in randomized sub-study, 130 in observational study). The preponderance of MBO patients will be accrued to be prospectively followed utilizing general modeling strategy along with propensity score techniques to compare treatment approaches. In addition, we will have a smaller subset of patients who will be randomized to surgical versus non-surgical interventions. Our data collection strategies are designed to minimize patient burden by this alternate research approach with clinically meaningful outcome measures as well as limited health-related quality of life surveys. The primary inclusion criteria for the study are whether a surgical option is being considered in the setting of MBO and there is equipoise to outcomes. The interventions to be compared are an initial surgical versus a non-surgical approach for MBO. Data forms will include demographic and disease history, hospital stay, days with NG tubes, TPN and other hydration, ability to eat or drink with dietary histories, complications, recurrence, total hospital days, and survival. In addition, research coordinators will serially acquire subjective QOL data from the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Gastrointestinal, which should not take more than 10 minutes to complete. The primary outcome measure will be good days, defined as being at home (out of the hospital) and alive. The difference we hope to find is two weeks in a 90 day span (20% difference). Secondary endpoints include days with NG tube, days of intravenous hydration, days eating solid foods, days drinking, and amount of intake, recurrence, morbidity, and survival. We will include a cost analysis plan as well. We anticipate results to be clinically useful to practitioners caring for MB patients."
"9165998","Phase 3 Clinical Trial_Safety and Efficacy of Ibalizumab for MDR HIV_BB-IND #9776 Project Summary/Abstract [Ibalizumab was designated an Orphan Drug in October, 2014, to treat patients with multidrug resistant HIV. Ibalizumab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in March, 2015. The FDA has indicated that a single Phase 3 trial demonstrating the efficacy and safety of newly manufactured ibalizumab will satisfy the clinical requirements for a Biological Licensing Application (BLA) for intravenous ibalizumab (see FDA Type C Meeting Minutes, Appended). The research is TMB-301, a Phase 3 clinical trial designed to demonstrate the antiviral activity of ibalizumab after one week of monotherapy at Day 14 and also at Week 25/EOS and the safety of ibalizumab when administered to patients with multi-drug resistant HIV by intravenous (IV) infusion for 24 weeks in combination with an optimized background regimen consisting of other antiretroviral drugs. The results of TMB-301 are expected to show that ibalizumab-based combination therapy using newly manufactured ibalizumab can effectively suppress viral replication in patients infected with multi-drug resistant HIV. The study is expected to confirm that infrequently administered medications such as ibalizumab can provide significant antiviral activity and perhaps demonstrate greater convenience to patients. The research is expected to result directly in the submission of a BLA to the FDA in 2016 for the registration of ibalizumab for the treatment of patients infected with multi-drug resistant HIV.] Ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks HIV-1 infection by binding specifically to domain 2 of human CD4, the primary receptor for HIV (Burkly, 1992). Ibalizumab has potent activity against a broad range of HIV strains including multi-drug-resistant HIV, but it does not interfere with CD4-mediated immune functions (Reimann, 1993; Boon, 2002). Over 230 patients have received ibalizumab treatment in FDA- sanctioned, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. The results demonstrated that ibalizumab 1) reduces HIV viral loads with potency similar to other approved antiretroviral agents, 2) is active against multi-drug-resistant HIV, 3) is tolerable with no additional side-effects (comparable to placebo), 4) has no discernible drug-drug interactions so it can be combined safely with currently marketed antiretroviral agents and concomitant medications, and 5) exhibits activity with dosing intervals up to four weeks in length (Kuritzkes, 2004; Jacobson, 2009; Norris, 2006; Khanlou, 2011). Collectively, the early clinical trials have all met their protocol- defined objectives for the safety and antiviral efficacy of ibalizumab therapy for HIV-1 infections. The specific objectives of this research include 1) producing additional data demonstrating the efficacy of ibalizumab for the treatment of multi-drug resistant HIV, sufficient to meet FDA requirements for registration, 2) producing additional data demonstrating the safety of ibalizumab for the treatment of multi-drug resistant HIV, sufficient to meet FDA requirements for registration, 3) demonstrating that newly formulated ibalizumab is safe and effective when administered by IV infusion."
"9254932","Project Summary  The long term goal of this project is to develop, validate, and commercialize an assay for improved analysis of C9orf72, a gene on chromosome 9 that is linked to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Expansion of a guanine and cytosine rich hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the non-coding region of C9orf72 is associated with 39% of familial ALS. The expansion also appears in 25% of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, as well as 7% of sporadic ALS and 6% of sporadic FTD. The C9orf72 region is difficult to size accurately because most expansions in affected individuals are >700 repeats in length. Currently testing typically relies on ?homebrew? PCR-based assays for accurate sizing of <35 repeats, or, separately, Southern blot analysis for crude sizing of >35 repeats. We have developed a solution to enable high throughput, reliable, sensitive, and accurate sizing of the repeat region for both short (<35 repeats) up to 145 repeats, and long expansions (146 to at least ~800 repeats) in a reflex assay. The proposed assay offers a solution to these technical challenges based on the repeat-primed assay platform (AmplideX® FMR1 PCR) that Asuragen has developed and successfully commercialized for fragile X syndrome, a CGG triplet repeat disorder. We will continue to leverage >6 years of experience in optimizing high performance diagnostic assays for GC- rich repeat sequences to develop an accurate and robust diagnostic test for C9orf72. Funding for this Phase II will support the efforts necessary to complete the development of the test. The specific aims of this proposal are:  Aim 1. Integrate a novel engineered PCR polymerase system to achieve extreme processivity and reliable  amplification of >800 hexanucleotide repeats.  Aim 2. Develop and integrate a set of controls and standards in an optimized workflow that supports C9orf72 testing.  Aim 3. Develop a data analysis pipeline and reporting tools within a user-friendly application that allows  rapid and accurate identification C9orf72 repeat number.    Aim 4. Evaluate an assay system that integrates the workflow and controls (Aims 1 and 2) with the  analysis software (Aim 3). Validate the integrated system with cell lines and retrospective clinical samples.  The development of an improved, information-rich assay for C9orf72 will be useful as a screening and diagnostic test for ALS and FTD as well as a clinical research tool to identify intermediate and/or expanded repeat sizes that are potentially relevant to other forms of age-onset neurodegeneration. In addition, this assay can further the understanding of known and novel genotype-phenotype associations and enable opportunities for targeted therapeutics and clinical trials."
"9136714","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary / Abstract: Veteran patients with Diabetes and/or Arterial Peripheral Vascular Disease are at significant risk for lower extremity amputation. There is no diagnostic test that can accurately or reliably predict which amputation level will heal, and what the patient specific, mortality risk, re-amputation risk or mobility outcome will be at each major amputation level. Decisions are therefore often made empirically based upon clinical experience. This has led to extreme variability in the relative frequencies of lower extremity amputation across VHA, as surgeons prioritize the risks and benefits in different ways. Cross sectional research has shown that there is a relationship between amputation level and the outcomes of mobility, re-amputation, and mortality. If an amputation is performed at the transfemoral level (TF) there is a greater risk of mortality, a greater likelihood of reduced mobility, but a very good probability tht primary healing will take place. In contrast an amputation at the transmetatarsal level (TM) is associated with very high revision rates, low mortality and for those that heal, a good mobility outcome. The outcome after transtibial (TT) amputation lies between these two extremes. These general and non-specific outcomes are likely strongly influenced by patient specific factors, but there is no evidence available at this time to guide decisions about which is the most appropriate amputation level, nor for the individual patient to provide input based upon their own priorities. This uncertainty leads to challenges for both the surgical team, and the patient. The literature indicates there is an important need for predictive models to be developed to better inform surgical recommendations and at the same time allow for patient centric priorities to be considered. Specific Aims Statement: We will use both clinical and administrative VA databases to develop and validate two patient-specific multivariable prediction models. Specific Aim 1: To develop and validate a patient-specific multivariable prediction model for 1-year mortality risk after incident dysvascular transmetatarsal (TM), transtibial (TT), and transfemoral (TF) amputation. Specific Aim 2: To develop and validate a patient-specific multivariable prediction model that predicts 1-year ipsilateral re-amputation (same or higher amputation level) surgery risk after incident TM, TT, and TF amputation. The successful development of these predictive models will complement a mobility outcome prediction model whose development is currently funded by VA RR&D. Together they will enable surgeons to better quantify patient specific outcome probabilities associated with performing an amputation at each major lower extremity amputation level. Communication of these probabilities to the patient will enable them to provide input to the decision as they balance their personal priorities of mobility, mortality and re-amputation."
"9137799","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to effective treatment, persons living with HIV and accessing care (PLWHC) in the United States (US) now have a life expectancy approaching the general population. In the general population, the population bubble caused by the post-WWII Baby Boom has been referred to as the Silver Tsunami. The goal of this project is to fill a vital gap for a more detailed, data-based projection of the imminent PLWHC Silver Tsunami to better inform allocation of resources in governmental and private healthcare systems and to identify targets for savings. Taking into account factors that affect the age distribution of PLWHC in the US, we will use simulation models to project the age distribution through 2030 to answer the question: What does the projected age distribution of PLWHC in the US look like? To be useful, data need to be disaggregated by important demographic (sex and race) and geographical characteristics. HIV infection has been shown to increase the risk of insulin resistance, chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction, end-stage renal disease, and cancer. Incorporating multimorbidity and polypharmacy into the projected age distribution will answer: What is the projected burden of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in adults aging with HIV? Information derived by a careful, data-based analysis that includes the burden of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in PLWHC will have many uses. We propose to focus on the important issue of healthcare costs as it is likely that costs will be compounded in adults aging with HIV as compared to those without HIV. By investigating the question How much will it cost to care for adults aging with HIV? health systems and state and federal budgets can begin to prepare for both HIV-related and non-HIV-related costs and identify targets for potential cost savings.  We have assembled a world-class collaboration that combines high-quality longitudinal data, epidemiological expertise, the scientific leaders of the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA-ACCORD), and the leaders in modeling of HIV disease and healthcare costs from the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) team to achieve the following aims: AIM 1: To fill the gap in knowledge by projecting age-specific proportions of PLWHC in the US through 2030, with estimates tailored to important demographic and geographic sub-groups. AIM 2: To project the burden of multimorbidity and polypharmacy among PLWHC in the US through 2030. AIM 3: To project the annual costs of non-HIV-related healthcare for PLWHC in the US through 2030.  The proposed aims align well with the research priorities of the 2016 Trans-NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research and the NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities and Guidelines for Determining AIDS Funding. Findings will provide key HIV epidemiologic and health services data that are necessary for guiding research priorities, increasing awareness of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in clinical management, and informing health systems resource allocations."
"9235829","PROJECT SUMMARY Patients with gastroparesis often suffer with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms that are not adequately treated due to both a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and lack of effective treatments. The participation of Temple University as a clinical center in the NIDDK Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium and the proposed studies will help achieve the broad, long term objectives of improving the understanding and treatment of patients with gastroparesis. The PI and Temple University are well qualified to continue to be one of the clinical centers in this consortium. Temple University has clinical expertise and an active research program in the evaluation and treatment of patients with gastroparesis. The aims for this renewal of the Gastroparesis Consortium are threefold. First, to better understand the pathologic basis of gastroparesis by continuing to provide gastric full thickness biopsy specimens from patients with gastroparesis. We are now collecting specimens from the antrum and obtaining freshly frozen tissue for RNA expression. Second, to better understand the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of patients with symptoms of gastroparesis by maintaining and expanding the Gastroparesis Registry. Our goal is to have four years of follow-up on patients which will require maintenance of the Registry and continued periodic follow-up visits. We propose to continue recruitment of new patients. Refinements to existing questionnaires and pathophysiologic measures, as well as new ones, will allow us to answer questions related to the pathogenesis, severity grading, complications, treatment responses, and clinical outcomes in patients with gastroparesis. Third, to conduct new multicenter studies of gastroparesis investigating the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Our application proposes three studies, each aimed at the understanding of the pathophysiology of symptoms and treatment of symptoms from gastroparesis. Improved testing will better associate pathophysiology with gastroparesis symptoms and ultimately enable targeted therapy to the underlying gastric pathophysiologic abnormality. Our first study will determine the effect of the 5HT-1 receptor agonist, buspirone, on early satiety and intragastric meal distribution in patients with symptoms of gastroparesis. Our second study is an evaluation of abdominal pain in gastroparesis, determining the prevalence of and response to treatment for chronic pancreatitis. Finally, our third study will assess the clinical outcome of patients undergoing endoscopic pyloromyotomy for gastroparesis, looking at the response and predictive factors for clinical improvement with this novel treatment. These three studies will ultimately enable physicians to better target therapy to the underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities in patients with gastroparesis. Temple's participation in the NIH Gastroparesis Clinical Consortium and the undertaking of Temple's proposed studies will help achieve the goal of the consortium by advancing our understanding of the pathophysiology and developing appropriate treatments for patients with symptomatic gastroparesis."
"9352955","Project Summary/Abstract Approximately 6.4 million Americans suffer from neurodegenerative diseases of aging. Clinical trials utilizing viral vector-mediated gene therapy for treating age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) are ongoing. This approach requires efficient gene transfer to the aged brain. Preclinical studies in rodents and non-human primates have informed optimal viral vector design for specific target structures and cellular populations, however these studies almost exclusively use young adult animals and therefore fail to recapitulate the aged brain environment. Our laboratories use viral vectors to model PD or test the therapeutic effects of trophic factors in young adult and aged rats. Recently, we found that the transduction efficiency mediated by various viral constructs is markedly compromised in the aged rat. Specifically, we utilized three different pseudotypes of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV2/2, rAAV2/5 and rAAV2/9) or lentivirus to express green fluorescent protein (GFP). Injections were made into either the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or the striatum of young adult or aged rats. The efficiency of nigrostriatal or striatonigral transduction was evaluated utilizing a variety of methods (stereology, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, western blot, qPCR). Following injection to the striatum, all vector constructs exhibited significant transduction deficiencies in aged rats. Following injection into the SNpc, rAAV2/2, rAAV2/5 and lentivirus exhibited deficient transduction associated with aging whereas equivalent transduction efficiency was observed in young and aged rats using rAAV2/9. Our results thus far suggest that, in general, the aged brain is strikingly resistant to transduction. The proposed studies seek to identify the causes of age-related transduction deficiencies in order to optimize future gene therapy clinical trials for Parkinson's and other age-related diseases."

One area of cardiovascular biology that is currently in pressing need of new therapies is the repair of myocardial infarction (MI), which afflicts one American every 34 seconds. Following MI, billions of myocytes are typically lost within the first days. These myocytes are not regenerated but are instead replaced by fibrosis. Replacement of necrotic cardiomyocytes with exogenous cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells has been shown to improve heart function after infarction in pre-clinical animal models. However, the critical challenge of creating large cardiac grafts that are well integrated with the host tissue has plagued the cell-based repair field since its inception, creating serious safety and efficacy concerns. For example, poor graft cell seeding efficiency and cell survival limit the efficacy of this approach. Additionally, graft cardiomyocytes are often separated from host cardiomyocytes by infarct scar tissue, which may result in arrhythmias caused by dyssynchronous coupling between graft and host. Finally, vascular networks connecting the host tissue to the graft are often dispersed and unorganized, limiting the survival and metabolic potential of grafted cells. To address these issues, I will build an integrated engineered human cardiac tissue platform, which can be remotely activated to degrade the local infarct scar as the tissue becomes vascularized. I will first develop a `thermogenetic' system that enables remote transient activation of protease overexpression only at the graft site and in concert with graft expansion after implantation. This controlled approach is necessary because ubiquitous overexpression or delivery of proteases could cause adverse myocardial remodeling or rupture. For improved vascularization, I will use a microtissue molding approach to test whether the presence of highly aligned microvascular `cords' in scaffold-free cardiac tissue guides microvascularization and accelerates tissue perfusion. I will then test whether together these systems enable improved engraftment, perfusion, and heart function following MI. This proposal is based on my previous experience in constructing and grafting scaffold-free human heart tissue from pluripotent stem cells, controlling grafted cells using gene therapy, and using microfabrication techniques to spatially organize multicellular tissue architecture. This work will represent the first steps towards comprehensive remote activation and control of engineered tissues after engraftment in vivo, introducing a new paradigm for precision post-implantation control of cell-based therapies for regenerative medicine applications."
"9272140","Dysfunction of the ?-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) pathway is genetically, neuropathologically, and biochemically implicated in Lewy body dementias. GBA pathway-directed markers and treatments offer an opportunity for rapidly implementing proof-of-concept trials of drugs designed to slow disease progression. A tool kit of tests is needed for biomarkers-guided go/no-go decisions that includes molecular biomarkers for target engagement, drug response, and disease progression.  In Aim 1, we will determine, whether disruption of the GBA pathway in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid is specifically associated with Lewy body dementias in a large, cross-sectional study of 435 individuals with Lewy body dementias, healthy controls, and disease controls with other dementias using targeted, quantitative mass spectrometry assays for fifty pathway sphingolipids and an assay for ?-glucocerebrosidase activity. Moreover, we will explore whether quantitative or qualitative changes in the GBA pathway inform on GBA mutation status, clinical disease severity, and clinical diagnosis. In Aim 2, we will determine, whether GBA pathway markers longitudinally track disease progression in Lewy body dementias. In Aim 3, we will longitudinally collect clinical data, CSF, and blood samples of 100 patients with DLB, PDD and controls from Harvard-affiliated hospitals and expand the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program collection.  These analyses will translate genetic clues into clinical trials markers. They will create the tools needed for innovative, genetics-inspired, biomarkers-guided phase II trials for Lewy body dementias and generally enrich the PDBP resource."
"9219852","Through our previous work funded by the American Parkinson Disease Association and NINDS, we have discovered a new genetic locus on the short arm of chromosome 20, and identified a new PD gene, TMEM230. TMEM230-linked PD shows clinical and pathological features compatible with those in sporadic PD. TMEM230, also known as C20orf30, is an uncharacterized gene. We performed extensive genetic and cellular studies on this new PD gene in vitro. We found that TMEM230 encodes a transmembrane protein of secretory and recycling vesicles, including synaptic vesicles in neurons. We also found that TMEM230 is a component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. We further performed functional studies and found that PD-linked TMEM230 mutants identified in our study impair synaptic vesicle trafficking and alpha-synuclein clearance in vitro. TMEM230 is the first transmembrane protein of synaptic vesicles identified in PD to date. Our findings, therefore, directly point to the dysfunction of synaptic vesicles in the pathogenesis of PD. The precise functions of TMEM230, and pathogenic mechanism of the TMEM230-mediated PD remain unclear. Based on the molecular features of TMEM230, and its relationship with synaptic vesicle and endosomal markers tested in our study, we hypothesize that TMEM230 is a trafficking protein of secretory/recycling vesicles, primarily involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling, and synaptic transmission in neurons; and dysfunction of the synaptic vesicles, such as impaired trafficking, recycling and synaptic transmission, underlies the pathogenesis of the TMEM230-linked PD, and possibly other forms of PD as well. Although our preliminary data in vitro are consistent with this hypothesis, in vivo data are lacking. Appropriate animal models relevant to testing potential pathogenic mechanisms have not been developed. In this application, we propose three closely interactive specific aims to generate relevant mouse models and test this hypothesis in vivo. In Specific Aim1, we will develop all three representative types of mouse models, including knockout, knockin and transgenic models. These models will provide unique and essential resources for mechanistic studies in Specific Aims 2 and 3. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the effects of different types of TMEM230 genetic modifications on alpha-synuclein clearance, motor and non-motor phenotypes, and PD-related pathology in the mouse models. To further provide insights into the molecular underpinning of PD phenotype and pathology caused by TMEM230-related mutations, we will use a combination of electrophysiological and cell biological approaches to study synaptic vesicle trafficking and synaptic transmission in the mouse models in Specific Aim 3. Successful completion of the proposed studies of this new PD-linked gene in mouse models should provide essential information for understanding the physiological functions of TMEM230, and the role of the mutant TMEM230 in the pathogenesis underlying PD. The positive outcomes from this application may also provide a mechanistic basis for PD therapeutic development."

In order to provide additional training in the problems of clinical ophthalmology, with an emphasis on translational problem solving, VSTP trainees also participate in the medical student ophthalmology minicourse. Through these programs, we hope to continue and expand upon the VSTPs success in recruiting, inspiring, and training the next generation of vision scientists."
"9215505","Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor with dismal prognosis. GBM displays remarkable cellular heterogeneity with a population of glioma stem cells (GSCs) at the apex of the differentiation hierarchy. Because GSCs promote tumor angiogenesis, cancer invasion, therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence, eliminating GSCs or inducing their differentiation may effectively improve GBM treatment. The stem cell-like property of GSCs is maintained by a set of core transcriptional regulators including c-Myc. Myc plays a critical role in promoting GBM malignant growth and radioresistance. C-Myc is not only regulated at the transcriptional level but also tightly controlled by post-translational modifications. Our preliminary data indicate that c-Myc is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXL14, and targeted for degradation in non-stem glioma cells. In GSCs, c-Myc protein is stabilized through the deubiquitination mediated by USP13 (Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 13). Importantly, USP13 is preferentially expressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioma cells and neural progenitor cells. Targeting USP13 by shRNA markedly reduced c-Myc protein, promoted GSC differentiation, disrupted GSC maintenance, and potently inhibited GSC tumorsphere formation. These data indicated that USP13 plays a crucial role in maintaining GSC self-renewal and tumorigenic potential through Myc stabilization. We hypothesize that USP13 antagonizes FBXL14 to stabilize c-Myc and promote the maintenance of GSCs, and that functional inhibition of USP13 disrupts GSCs to suppress GBM tumor growth. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1. Determine the role of USP13 in regulating c-Myc to maintain GSC tumorigenic potential; 2. Define the role of FBXL14 in c-Myc degradation and tumor suppression of glioma cells; 3. Evaluate the therapeutic benefit of targeting USP13 in GBM therapy. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of disrupting GSCs through USP13 inhibition in a preclinical setting. As c-Myc oncoprotein is a transcription factor and is required for normal cell proliferation, therapeutic targeting of c-Myc is difficult. However, targeting its upstream regulator USP13 to selectively disrupt c-Myc in GSCs could provide a practical approach. We will determine whether targeting deubiquitinase USP13 can serve as an effective therapeutic strategy to improve GBM treatment."
"9072152","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision to the awarded R01 1R01GM112520-01, Integrase Binding Proteins as Drug Targets to Inhibit HIV-1 Assembly. The reason for this revision is the availability of new NMR based solution structure for INI1. Availability of NMR structure enhances our ability to perform the goals of funded R01, whose Aims are as follows. The Aim I is to understand the mechanism by which INI1 influences assembly; Aim II is to understand the nuclear export properties of INI1; and the Aim III is to: (i)  define the interaction of minimal IN binding domain of INI1 with IN using computational modeling and identify the interface residues involved in IN-INI1 interactions; and (ii) to screen for drugs/peptidomimetics that disrupt IN-INI1 interaction using Alpha Screen. However, NMR based structural determination of INI1 or IN-INI1 interactions are not part of the goals of the R01. The newly proposed supplemental studies will enhance our ability to perform the goals of Aims I and III, as described below.  INI1 is an integrase binding protein that has been shown to influence multiple stages of HIV-1 replication including LTR-mediated transcription, assembly and particle production and integration. In addition, INI1 is an epigenetic regulator and a component of SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling. It is a tumor suppressor mutated in large number of human cancers. Despite its wide spread importance in cancer, epigenetic and transcriptional regulation and HIV-1 replication, the structure of INI1 is unknown, largely due to inability to obtain large quantities of pure protein or inability to crystallize.  W have been recently successful in purifying and obtaining NMR structure of the transdominant negative mutant of INI1, also termed, S6(Rpt1) or INI1183-265. Having solution structure of INI1183-265 rapidly enhances our ability to understand the structural basis of IN-INI1 interactions and enriches our ability to attain the goals proposed in the aims of R01, especially aim III. With INI1183-265 structure in hand, the goals for the supplemental application are as follows. In Supplemental Aim I we will use NMR-based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) mapping to identify the interface residues within IN-INI1 complexes and use standard NMR methods to determine the complete structure of the INI1183-265 - IN complex. In Supplemental Aim II, we will carry out structure-based functional studies by generating mutations of interface residues of IN and INI1 and test the effect of these mutants on HIV-1 replication, especially assembly and particle production. These studies will allow, for the first time, to gain understanding of the structural basis of IN-INI1 interactions, their effect on HIV-1 replication, and pave the way for drug development to disrupt these interactions."

CISO assists investigators in  protocol development and facilitates the review to activation process. It is also directly responsible for: 1)  hiring, training and supervising clinical research staff, 2) quality assurance; 3) policies and procedures  related to clinical trials conduct; 4) support and coordination of clinical research committees (PRMS,  DSM, Quality Assurance); 5) metrics and reporting.   The Medical Director of CISO is Anthony El-Khoueiry, MD, a highly experienced cancer clinical  trialist. He is supported by Assistant Medical Director, Kevin Kelly, MD. CISO's Associate Director, Kay  Johnson, RN, announced her retirement in 2014 after more than 20 years of service but continues as a  consultant to ensure a smooth transition while a national search is on-going. Day to day activities are  handled by two seasoned managers, the Assistant Director for Clinical Research Operations and  Assistant Director for Regulatory Affairs. USC Norris has also engaged Huron Consulting to identify  strategies for improvement and to help CISO respond to the continued growth and complexity of the  clinical research program.   CISO has successfully improved efficiency and effectiveness during the project period. Of particular  note is USC's decision to implement OnCore enterprise-wide and to revamp the contracting and  budgeting processes.

In regards to clinical trials participation, USC Norris has continued to build on its successful strategies  for the inclusion of minorities using a multi-prong approach. Hispanics and Asian Pacific Islanders  represent the two largest minority communities in the USC Norris catchment area. In 2013, Hispanics  represented 40.5% of new cancer cases at USC Norris hospitals and 44.8% of accrual to interventional  therapeutic trials. Asian/Pacific Islanders represented 14.3% of new cancers at USC Norris hospitals and  11.3% of accrual to interventional therapeutic trials."
"9203032","Abstract  In this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by developing and executing a market access plan, conducting a pilot clinical study, and formulating an intellectual property strategy. With its fully-automated use, real-world applicability (handles variable number of images per patient including poor quality and external eye images), high throughput capability (can analyze thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable cloud-based architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the fast growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers.  DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes potentially affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, DR remains to be one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US, 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR related vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening safety (sensitivity) and efficacy (specificity) on multiple large real- world datasets including one with over 30,000 patient cases (and 240,000 images). Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. We will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials which will pave the way for EyeArt?s availability in the US DR screening market. EyeArt will reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity, and also help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus aid in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment."
"9358747","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people to become active participants in their health care. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy showed that more than 75 million Americans had basic health literacy skills, indicating that as many as 1 in 4 Americans can have difficulty understanding information about their healthcare. Persons in racial and ethnic minorities are likely to have even lower levels of health literacy. Twenty-four percent of blacks (9.5 million persons) and 41% of Hispanics (21 million persons) have below basic levels of health literacy. These persons have lower levels of health literacy and compelling evidence, including our own findings (see below), link race and ethnicity to disparities in health via health literacy. Members of minority groups and older adults are more frequently affected by chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, asthma, hepatitis C, HIV infection, mental health disorders and many others. The twin burdens of chronic disease and low levels of health literacy thus fall disproportionately on those most in need - members of minorities and older adults, all of whom likely to experience one or more chronic conditions while often not having the health literacy skills to help them cope. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that cuts across specific diseases. CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance and treatment adherence. Studies show that in- person CDSM classes improve patients' functioning and reduce healthcare utilization, but their availability is limited due to the lack of qualified personnel and cost. Similarly, while interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, they are difficult to scale to levels needed to meet the challenge of low health literacy (for more than 40 million persons) due to their cost. Effective interventions with the potential for wider dissemination at reasonable costs are urgently needed. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy that can deployed either as an information kiosk in a clinical office or n the Internet could be cost- effective in improving patients' health literacy and adherence. It is nt clear, however, whether the same sort of computer-delivered, multimedia and interactive approach will be effective in improving CDSM skills in persons with low baseline levels of health literacy, and if it is, whether its effects will extend beyond health literacy to general health, slf-efficacy, activation, and treatment adherence. In this follow-up study we will evaluate this possibility by creating a personally relevant computer-delivered intervention targeting CDSM and health literacy among African-Americans, Hispanics, and white non-Hispanics:"
"9136769","PROJECT 3 ABSTRACT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains one of the most prevalent and costly medical disorders. A third or more of patients may not achieve symptomatic remission despite multiple medication treatments; many other individuals are simply unable or unwilling to initiate prescription pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment. Complementary and alternative medications (CAM) represent an important option for such patients. In addition to understanding which CAM antidepressant strategies are efficacious for depression as well as for stress, the aim of Project 1, it would be highly valuable to understand the mechanisms by which certain CAM treatments exert their therapeutic effect. This understanding could increase the acceptability of current treatments, allow better matching of patients with effective treatments, and facilitate the investigation and development of novel CAM treatments. For standard antidepressant treatments, multiple hypotheses regarding mechanisms of action have been developed. These include (i) promotion of neuroplasticity, (ii) modulation of inflammation, and (iii) promotion of neurogenesis. To date, investigation of these latter hypotheses has been hampered by a lack of direct models of human neurobiology ? and particularly neuropathology - amenable to rapid screening and quantitative functional assessment. That is, it has not been possible to examine whether these hypotheses are supported in neural tissue from patients with the particular disease targeted by these interventions. Progress in stem cell technology and developmental neurobiology allows a novel strategy that forms the focus of Project 3. Dermal fibroblasts from 180 patient participants in the randomized trial of Project One will be reprogrammed (transdifferentiated) to induced neurons (iNs). Transcriptional profiles of these iN's will be compared after exposure to n-3 fatty acids, S- adenosyl L-methionine (SAMe), or vehicle to test whether the two CAMs regulate genes related to neuroplasticity (Aim 1a), and whether degree of modulation of neuroplasticity is associated with treatment efficacy. In parallel, a subset (10 per treatment arm) of patient-derived fibroblasts will be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells. These cell lines will then be differentiated into neuronal precursors and ultimately to mature neurons. Work by this group and others indicates that it is possible to generate such cells and incorporate them in high-throughput, quantitative functional assays to characterize phenotypes relevant to antidepressant mechanism. Specifically, the hypothesis that n-3 fatty acids and SAMe modulate inflammatory markers on neural-lineage cells (Aim 2a), and promote neurogenesis (Aim 2b), will be tested using validated assays. The hypothesis that these mechanisms are associated with treatment efficacy will also be tested. In addition to examining these primary hypotheses, this project will establish a critical resource for future investigation of CAM compounds, a biobank of 180 fibroblasts and 30 pluripotent stem cells and neuronal precursor cells, all derived from patients with MDD participating in Project 1's placebo-controlled investigations. NARRATIVE Major depressive disorder is a major contributor to morbidity worldwide, and existing treatments fail to yield symptomatic remission in ~1/3 of patients. While Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) compounds are increasingly used to treat depression, and well-accepted by patients, their mechanisms of effect have not been fully characterized. The proposed investigation will test specific hypotheses extending preliminary data using unique patient-derived stem cells and induced neurons, while at the same timing establishing biomarkers, biosignatures, and a biobank to facilitate future CAM studies."
"9329821","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major technological and analytical advances in human brain imaging achieved as part of the Human Connectome Projects (HCP) enable examination of structural and functional brain connectivity at unprecedented levels of spatial and temporal resolution. This information is proving invaluable for enhancing our understanding of normative variation in young adult brain connectivity. It is now timely to use the tools and analytical approaches developed by the HCP to understand how structural and functional wiring of the brain changes during the aging process. Using state-of-the art HCP imaging approaches will allow investigators to push our currently limited understanding of normative brain aging to new levels. We propose an effort involving a consortium of five sites (Massachusetts General Hospital, University of California at Los Angeles, University of Minnesota, Washington University in St. Louis, and Oxford University), with extensive complementary expertise in human brain imaging and aging and including many investigators associated with the original adult and pilot lifespan HCP efforts. This synergistic integration of advances from the MGH and WU-MINN-OXFORD HCPs with cutting-edge expertise in aging provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of the normative changes in human brain connectivity with aging. Aim 1 will be to optimize existing HCP Lifespan Pilot project protocols to respect practical constraints in studying adults over a wide age range, including the very old (80+ years). Aim 2 will be to collect high quality neuroimaging, behavioral, and other datasets on 1200 individuals in the age range of 36 - 100+ years, using matched protocols across sites. This will enable robust cross-sectional analyses of age-related changes in network properties including metrics of connectivity, network integrity, response properties during tasks, and behavior. Aim 3 will be to collect and analyze longitudinal data on a subset of 300 individuals in three understudied and scientifically interesting groups: ages 36-44 (when late maturational and early aging processes may co-occur); ages 45-59 (perimenopausal, when rapid hormonal changes can affect cognition and the brain); and ages 80 - 100+ (the `very old', whose brains may reflect a `healthy survivor' state). The information gained relating to these important periods will enhance our understanding of how important phenomena such as hormonal changes affect the brain and will provide insights into factors that enable cognitively intact function into advanced aging. Aim 4 will capitalize on our success in sharing data in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), and will use these established tools, platforms, and procedures to make this data publicly available through the Connectome Coordination Facility."
"9353025","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of a definitive cause for mammalian aging has remained elusive despite decades of investigation. Many processes have been found to be altered in aged organisms, including telomere maintenance, insulin signaling, mitochondrial function, DNA repair, and proteostasis, among others. How these processes are connected remains incompletely understood. We have established a new genetic and biochemical connection between two of these critical aging associated processes - telomere maintenance and proteostasis. Telomeres shorten during human aging in diverse tissues and the reason that telomeres cannot be efficiently maintained in somatic tissues with advancing age is not known. We have shown that telomere maintenance in human cells and in human tissues is exquisitely dependent upon the action of the chaperonin TRiC. During evolution of higher eukaryotes, telomerase hijacked a small nuclear RNA pathway, required for telomerase assembly and trafficking. TCAB1 is a telomerase holoenzyme protein and the protein factor that enables trafficking of both telomerase and small Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs) to Cajal bodies. Human germline mutations in TCAB1 cause the premature aging and stem cell disease dyskeratosis congenita. We have shown that telomerase requires TCAB1 for proper trafficking within the nucleus and for telomere maintenance. TCAB1 serves a less well understood role in enabling scaRNAs to support post-transcriptional modification of splicing RNAs - and presumably in splicing and maturation of cellular pre-mRNAs. Through a genetic screen in human cells, we recently discovered that TCAB1 is an obligate substrate of TRiC. If TRiC mediated folding of TCAB1 is disrupted, telomerase function is abrogated, tissue maintenance is disrupted and dyskeratosis congenita ensues. This novel connection between proteostasis and telomere maintenance raises important question regarding the cause of telomere shortening with advancing age, but also how proteostasis may connect more broadly to RNA-dependent processes. We propose that impaired TRiC function with aging may lead to misfolded TCAB1, in turn causing both diminished telomerase function and altered mRNA splicing. This hypothesis suggests that reduced proteostasis may propagate broadly to RNA networks. The goals of this proposal are: (1) To understand how telomerase catalytic function depends upon TCAB1 (2) To determine how TCAB1 loss affects scaRNA function and RNA splicing and (3) To determine how TCAB1 loss affects tissue homeostasis."

"9240517","The expansive goal of this project is to develop new means to visualize the activation of endogenous voltage gated ion channels (VGICs). Difficulties in identifying when and where specific VGICs become involved in electrical signals limit our fundamental understanding of neuronal circuits and impede the discovery of therapeutics. Novel tools to image the activity of VGIC subtypes enable fluorescence imaging of channel participation in physiological and pathophysiological signaling. Technology to see specific ion channels activate could aid in validation of drug targets for a host of maladies, including chronic itch and neuropathic pain. Neurons exhibit tremendous diversity in their electrical signaling, a consequence of the distinct collections of VGICs different cells. Understanding how individual VGIC subtypes contribute to electrical signaling remains a significant challenge. We propose to develop ion channel activity probes to monitor activity of VGICs in neurons. This technology we are developing can, in principle, be used to target any subtype of VGIC."

Although being vigorously pursued, multiple attempts targeting on A? generation/clearance have been failed in Clinical trials, mainly due to toxic side effects and lack of efficacy. As reported recently in Scientific Reports, we identified the human RPS23RG1 gene with the ability to reduce A? production and tau phosphorylation. We also showed that RPS23RG1 overexpression counteracted A? oligomer (oA?)-induced synaptic loss and cognitive impairments by activating adenylate cyclase/PKA signaling pathways, which in turn caused the activation of CREB (an important transcription factor regulating learning and memory) and the inactivation of GSK-3?/? (an important kinase inducing tau hyperphosphorylation). Thus, RPS23RG1 can be further exploited for its therapeutic potential in AD. The purpose of this project is to generate an agonistic (activating) nanoantibody targeting RPS23RG1 to promote RPS23RG1-mediated synaptic and cognitive protection against AD. Nanantibody (nAb) is a distinctive type of antibody fragment derived from camelid heavy-chain only antibody (HCAb). As a therapeutic candidate, nAb holds many superior properties over conventional antibodies. In addition, agonistic (activating) antibodies have been widely reported and used in many areas of research and therapy, including those targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this proposal, we will generate humanized nanoantibodies that will bind RPS23RG1 and activate downstream signaling pathways. We will examine the expression of RPS23RG1 in AD postmortem brains and its correlation with the severity of premortem cognitive decline in human patients with severe memory loss, mild memory impairment (MCI), or normal cognition as control. We will also examine its ability to activate downstream signaling pathways to counteract synaptic and cognitive decline in both in vitro and in vivo animal models of AD. We expect that RPS23RG1 is downregulated in AD patient brains and its reduction correlates with the severity of dementia in AD and MCI patients, and that agonistic RPS23RG1 nanoantibodies reduce A? and phosphorylated-tau levels, and mitigate synaptic loss and cognitive impairment in an PKA- dependent manner in AD mice. Our results should lay a foundation for the future development of RPS23RG1 nanoantibodies as therapeutics in AD."
"9355756","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Project 1 will analyze pharmacokinetics of the prototypical carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in humans at environmentally relevant exposures. Currently, regulatory agencies (EPA, FDA) and ATSDR and lARC have to rely on high-dose animal studies for predicting safe lifetime exposure levels. Our overall hypothesis is that BaP, given to humans at levels encountered in the environment, will exhibit pharmacokinetics predictable from PBPK models constructed in mice. We further hypothesize that the relative potency factor (RPF) for humans exposed to PAH dietary mixtures will be predictive of risk. The final aim is exploratory and seeks to identify individuals with greater susceptibility based on a common genetic polymorphism. Human volunteers will be administered a dose of [14C]-BaP an order of magnitude lower than the average daily exposure of a U.S. non-smoker. The use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) allows for micro-dosing of both chemical and radioisotope (5 nCi) and still follow blood and urine levels for three days. Use of newly developed AMS technology permits us to access the levels of parent BaP as well as individual metabolites, a major advance that will contribute to ask assessment. The EPA is currently considering the use of a relative potency factor (RPF) approach in risk assessment for PAH mixtures. We will conduct a study in which 1-3 ounces of smoked salmon containing ten times the BaPeq, based on the RPF of the PAHs in the salmon, will be co-administered with the [14C]- BaP. By examining pharmacokinetics, metabolite profiles and covalent DNA adducts in blood, we can provide the first test ever of the RPF approach in humans and at environmentally relevant levels. Finally, individuals that exhibit distinct BaP metabolite profiles or levels of BaP-DNA adducts will be genotyped for allelic variants of BaP-metabolizing enzymes in an exploratory gene-environment interaction study. These studies are highly innovative and significant and will markedly advance the field of risk assessment by providing a unique and powerful dataset on pharmacokinetic behavior of PAHs in humans exposed at environmental levels."
"9207390","Project Summary/Abstract  Young people at highest risk for HIV in the U.S. will be gay, bisexual transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) in communities with high HIV incidence and overwhelmingly Black and Latino. Focusing on Los Angeles and New Orleans, seronegative youth at highest risk for HIV will be screened in homeless shelters and gay-identified community-based organizations (CBO). A cohort of 1500 seronegative youth will be recruited that is 82% male (79% GBTY), 66% Black, 16% Latino, and 18% white, non-Hispanic. About 27% will be 12-17 and 73% between 18-24 years old. All youth will be followed longitudinally over 24 months at four month intervals and tested for HIV, STI, serious substance abuse, health care utilization, and comorbid conditions ? a Prototypical Retention/Prevention (R/P) Strategy. Over 24 months, acutely HIV infected youth will be triaged to Study 1. This Prototypical R/P Strategy operationalizes the CDC's recommendations for the engagement of GBTY in repeat HIV testing, linkage to care, and options for combination prevention (PrEP, PEP ? with behavioral interventions).  Building on this team's extensive experience with behavioral and mobile/social media interventions, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted with four intervention conditions: 1) an Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention (AMMI), which will use texts to diffuse prevention messages daily and to monitor risk behaviors weekly (n=900); 2) a Peer Support intervention on a social media platform (i.e., Facebook) in which young people will post messages and stories about their experiences preventing HIV, plus the AMMI (n=200); 3) an eNavigator intervention in which a B.A.-level staff supports youth, primarily through texting and social media, but also in-person meetings, to provide support in crisis situations, refer to treatment, and assist in gaining access to health care and other services, plus Peer Support and AMMI (n=200); and, 4) a combined intervention of eNavigator, Peer Support, and AMMI (n=200). A single outcome will be composed of six key behaviors (access to medical care, accessing and adherence to PrEP or PEP, treatment of all STI, and 100% condom use). In addition to evaluating the added benefit of increasing levels of intervention, the brief 7- item weekly text-messaging monitoring surveys will provide approximately 100,000 weekly reports of indicators of primary and secondary outcomes that can inform our understandings about the relationships between risk and comorbid states. This study will have policy implications for the allocation of resources to HIV testing resources in local communities, the uptake and scalability of text and social media interventions, and the models for diffusing evidence-based interventions (EBI) globally (without requiring replication with fidelity to a manual)."

"9255602","Project Summary Modern dynamic upper limb prosthetic terminal devices tend to either be functional or cosmetic, with most common designs making compromises between both aspects. Prosthetic hooks and grippers are particularly good at grasping a variety of objects but are not cosmetic. Conventional electric hands are more cosmetic, but do not allow for conformal grasp or multiple grasp patterns and have difficulty grasping small objects. Multi- articulating hands are also cosmetic, can conform to larger objects that are grasped, and offer multiple grasp patterns. However, multi-articulating hands still have difficulty grasping and manipulating smaller objects. As no single terminal device meets all of the criteria of an ideal terminal device, users often have to physically remove and don different terminal devices to achieve the variety of tasks that they need to perform in their activities of daily living (ADLs). The proposed solution aims to combine the advantages of the common terminal devices into one solution, by combining the practicality and dexterity of a split-hook or gripper with the aesthetics of multi- articulating hands. The primary objective of the proposed project is design, develop and test a novel terminal device. Design criteria related to size, grasping force, etc. will be generated and refined as iterations of the device are created. The ability of the device to meet the design criteria will be verified through bench top testing. The device will then be tested with a small sample of amputee end-users using clinically validated outcomes measures. These pilot tests will evaluate the feasibility of the device, demonstrate improvements in function, and drive further development. Feedback from both amputees and clinicians will also be solicited to guide future design iterations. The proposed terminal device would allow amputees more utility from their prosthesis in tasks requiring fine grasping with two hands, such as in tying shoes or in work activities, such as manufacturing small components. All users would be able to have the best aspects of fine-motor control, the existing gross function, and cosmetic appeal in a single terminal device."

The IPRC will emphasize community engagement and community-based research to help reduce disparities and work closely with community partners throughout Illinois to develop and sustain education and training programs and translate research findings into effective public health policies and environmental changes. The unifying theme of the proposed IPRC of Supporting Policy and Environmental Change aimed at improving health behaviors and reducing disparities will be reflected in all of our Center activities. The IPRC proposed activitie are guided by the CDC's Logic Model for the Prevention Research Center Program and will concentrate in six main areas and aim to: (1) Engage researchers and the community in expert multi-disciplinary applied health promotion and health prevention community-based research aimed at improving health behaviors and reducing chronic disease through effective evidenced-based policy and environmental changes; (2) Conduct community training and provide technical assistance locally and statewide and graduate student and post-doctoral mentoring and education to increase researcher, stakeholder, and community capacity to conduct community- based health prevention research and undertake policy, program, and environmental evaluations; (3) Increase translation of evidence-based research findings into best practices and policies; (4) Build and provide a communications infrastructure and plan that supports information sharing about programmatic, educational and scientific information for a variety of audiences including the public health practice community; local and state health coalitions and advocacy groups; local, state, and national policy-makers; prevention researchers; and, the public; (5) Conduct rigorous evaluations of all IPRC components, report findings, and use this information to improve IPRC programs; and, (6) Identify and address racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and rural disparities in all aspects of the Center's research, community engagement, training, communication, and evaluation to improve health behaviors and reduce related disease risks and outcomes among disadvantaged populations. The IPRC applied public health prevention research project addresses a key CDC Winnable Battle focused on increasing access to and use of parks. Working with community stakeholders, the project capitalizes on planned and funded Chicago Park District playground renovations to evaluate the renovations and implement a park coalition building intervention to increase local capacity to enhance the effects of playground revitalization on park programming, ongoing maintenance, safety, and, in turn, park utilization and physical activity."
"9134896","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to rapidly withdraw from potentially harmful stimuli is critical for survival. The sensory neurons detecting noxious stimuli have been well characterized, but the interneurons that modify and integrate these signals in the spinal cord remains largely unknown. This is particularly relevant for cases of chronic pain, where aberrant sensitization of interneurons in the spinal cord can elicit a sensation of pain in the absence of noxious stimuli. Studying the neural circuitry underlying nociception is feasible using a simple model, such as Drosophila larvae, which display robust and well-characterized nociceptive behaviors and possess a sophisticated genetic tool kit that allows for cell-specific labeling and manipulation.  I have identified a population of interneurons (sLN1s), directly downstream of the primary nociceptive sensory neurons that are required for generating specific nociceptive behaviors. However, silencing sLN1s does not abolish nociceptive behavior, indicating that there are additional interneurons with distinct roles in nociception. This proposal aims (i) to resolve the functional role of these sLN1 interneurons in generating specific nociceptive behaviors; (ii) reconstruct the nociceptive circuit downstream of sLN1s using previously generated serial section electron micrographs and (iii) assess how this assembly of interneurons generates discrete nociceptive behaviors. This research will reveal how noxious information is transformed to behavior, and potentially elucidate the cellular basis for anomalies in the processing of information by nociceptive pathways, including chronic pain states."
"9207650","    PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cyanide, a very toxic mitochondrial poison, has a wide spread usage in various industrial activities. It is present in many synthetic materials and can be released in gaseous form during a house fire. Since CN can be easily weaponized, it is considered as a serious threat for the civilian population. The treatment of acute CN intoxication relies on (1) specific antidotes, to decrease the concentration of CN in the blood and tissues, and (2) symptomatic treatments, essential at the early stage of exposure, consisting in an aggressive ventilatory and circulatory support, akin to the treatment of any conditions associated with cardio-respiratory depression.  We have recently found that the phenothiazinium chromophore methylene blue (MB), which can counteract the toxicity of various mitochondrial poisons (hydrogen sulfide and Azure B), can also oppose CN- induced acute circulatory failure. The mechanisms of action of MB as well as the limits of its efficacy, following CN intoxication, remain to be determined.  The objective of our proposal is first to validate our preliminary observations and to determine the interest of the use of MB during and following CN intoxication induced coma and cardiac failure in the rat. We will determine if MB can improve the immediate and long-term outcome of CN intoxication when used alone and more importantly as an adjuvant of antidotes already approved for the treatment of CN intoxication. Second, we will explore the potential mechanisms of action of MB, using isolated contracting cardiomyocytes intoxicated with CN. These studies will be performed in collaboration with the group of Dr. Joseph Cheung, Temple University.  Since MB has been used for decades for treating methemoglobinemia (1-2 mg/kg iv) in humans, our goal is to reposition methylene blue, a drug already on the WHO's list of essential medications, as a treatment of CN intoxication."
"9164431","Individuals often face complex choices where value is not easily realized and the goal is to select the optimal rewards. Deficits in reward processing, or deliberation, are characteristic of many psychiatric diseases. For example, schizophrenia patients appear unable to represent the value of all available choice options, and therefore fail to select actions that have the highest values. Contemporary treatment options for many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, target dopamine. Dopamine neurons code subjective value. However, dopamine responses do not display extended physiological profiles of neurons involved in deliberation. Thus, the neurocomputational mechanisms of deliberation likely involve reward structures to which dopamine neurons project. The goals of this research are to formalize the investigation of value deliberation using mathematical optimization theory, and to uncover the neuronal algorithms and implementation of optimization over value. With these aims in mind, monkeys will be trained in a behavioral paradigm based on a combinatorial optimization problem, the knapsack problem (KP). Given a number of objects with different values and weights, the KP asks what is the most valuable subset of the objects that a knapsack can carry without breaking. Despite this apparent simplicity, the fastest computers cannot find and verify the optimal solution to the KP because the computational complexity scales directly with the number of objects. We will use computational complexity to modulate the difficulty of the behavioral task. Monkeys will select a set of rewards that fit inside a virtual knapsack. Choose too few, and they will harvest less reward than optimal. Exceed the capacity of the knapsack, and it will `break' and not deliver reward. We will use operations research algorithms to estimate the heuristics used to optimize over rewards. We will record from the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Both structures are dopamine projection targets, and both are implicated in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. I will use optogenetics and electrophysiology to investigate direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons. These two neuron populations have distinct projection fields and opposing effects on thalamic output. Likewise the dopamine value signal has opposing influences on direct and indirect pathway neurons, and this points to differential role for direct and indirect pathway neurons in value-based deliberation. Thus, I will investigate how value-based deliberation is differentially reflected in these pathways. The prefrontal cortex mediates value comparison, and dopamine release is hypothesized to mediate those value comparisons. I will use optogenetics and electrophysiology to investigate prefrontal excitatory and inhibitory neurons and their respective roles during value-based deliberation. The findings will reveal the neural algorithms used to optimize value, reveal the neuron-type specific implementation of those algorithms, provide mechanistic insights regarding psychiatric diseases, and develop a foundation for circuit therapies to correct reward processing deficits. "
"8998412","Project Summary  The Tumor Biology Program aims to catalyze research within the ACC to advance understanding of the  molecular mechanisms underlying cancer pathogenesis and to translate this knowledge to identify new and  more effective preventive, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches. This Program, which was  founded in the early 1970s, continues to progressively respond to advances in cancer research. Its overarching  scientific aims are to: 1) Elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of carcinogenesis, and 2) Translate these  findings into durable clinical applications. To that end, the Program is organized around three central goals or  themes: 1) Structural biology of molecules relevant to cancer, 2) The molecular and cellular basis of cancer,  and 3) The use of model organisms to study cancer in vivo. Interactive, intra-Programmatic scientific affinity  groups foster collaboration within and across themes, including: 1) Tthe tumor microenvironment, 2) RNA  biology, 3) DNA repair and genomic stability, 4) Cancer cell metabolism (this spawned a new ACC Basic  Science Center of Excellence), and 5) Organ-specific cancers, such as pancreatic (this has been integrated  into the new ACC Pancreatic Translational Center of Excellence). The Program continues under the strong  leadership of Anil Rustgi, MD, who fosters deep and impactful intra- and inter-Programmatic collaborative  relationships. Program Leadership is also instrumental in recruiting new members (e.g., Drs. Berger, Feldser,  Garcia, and Puré), mentoring junior faculty, establishing scientific affinity groups to leverage and further  develop common research interests among faculty members, and organizing conferences and symposia.  Program members are extremely actively involved in the training and mentorship of PhD students, MD/PhD  students, and MD or PhD postdoctoral fellows by virtue of their leadership roles in the Penn Biomedical  Graduate Studies, MD/PhD (MSTP) program and NIH T32 training grants. Program Leadership was highly  successful in harnessing Institutional support to catalyze a tumor biology translational research initiative and  increased translational research has been pursued in both thematic and organ-specific contexts. Its success is  evident in the emergence of new transdisciplinary, disease-specific collaborations that join Program members  with colleagues in Clinical Research and Population Science to study cancers, such as pancreatic and  esophageal, in which there is an unmet need for improved diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the Program  has 50 members from 16 departments and four different schools with total funding of $22M (annual direct  costs) of which $18.7M is peer-reviewed and $5.6M is NCI-funded. Since 2010, members published 466  cancer-related papers, of which 15% were intra-Programmatic, 32% were inter-Programmatic, and 30% were  multi-institutional."
"9074440","Abstract - Project 1 (Targeting Metabolic Dependencies in PDAC)  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States  with a median survival of less than 6 months and a dismal 5-year survival rate of 7%. The highly malignant  nature of PDAC is largely the result of driving oncogenic Kras mutations (Kras*) in >90% of tumors, as well as  the heterogeneous nature of the disease at both the genomic and cellular levels. To date, no drug directly  targeting Kras* has reached the clinic, and inhibitors of Kras* effector pathways in clinical trials have achieved  only minimal responses followed by relapse of aggressive disease. Furthermore, immune targeting of PDAC  has so far been unsuccessful. Thus, a critical need remains to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities in PDAC.  In our previous grant cycle, Project 1 and our P01 team established a role for Kras* in tumor maintenance in  vivo wherein it controlled key metabolism enzymes supporting cancer-relevant anabolic processes that, in turn,  are required for Kras*-driven PDAC maintenance. Using our inducible Kras* PDAC model, we also identified a  subset of tumor cells with tumor-initiating cell (TIC) properties that can survive Kras* extinction and may lead to  tumor recurrence following oncogene ablation. One of the hallmarks of these Kras* extinction-resistant cells  (KRCs) is the shift from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to sustain cell viability. Our  P01 team further demonstrated that, while PDAC exhibits high basal autophagy, autophagic flux in KRCs was  further enhanced to supply substrate for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and targeting  autophagy or OXPHOS effectively eliminated KRCs to prevent tumor relapse. Therefore, the collaborative work  from our P01 team strongly suggests that effective therapeutics for PDAC should target not only players  essential for Kras*-dependent tumor maintenance, but also pathways required to maintain KRCs. These data  are the basis for an initiative begun during the last grant cycle to develop a novel OXPHOS inhibitor compound  in PDAC, IACS-10759, at the Institute for Applied Cancer Science. In this next cycle, Project 1 will continue our  efforts to better define the metabolism programs that sustain Kras*-dependent tumors as well as KRCs and to  explore the translational potential of targeting metabolic processes, including targeting OXPHOS with IACS-  10759. Project 1 will work closely with the Cores, which have extensive expertise in pathology, preclinical  therapeutics, and computational biology, and will be highly integrated with Project 2 to characterize the role of  autophagy-regulating pathways. Our studies will also integrate with Project 3, using our inducible Kras* mouse  model to explore the effects of Kras*-dependent and ?independent metabolism programs on tumor immunity  and response to immune checkpoint therapy. The knowledge gained from these highly integrated studies aims  to inform future clinical trials opportunities.   "
"9271670","PROJECT SUMMARY  Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (ART; HAART) has had tremendous success in suppressing HIV replication and reducing HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. However, the prevalence of HIV-associated neurological disorders (NeuroAIDS) such as neuropathic pain and neurocognitive deficits remain high, even in the post ART era. This is puzzling in the perspective of low viral loads, and presents major clinical challenges. Yet, the underlying neuropathophysiological mechanism is poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests a key role of ongoing chronic neuroinflammation in NeuroAIDS pathogenesis. Current mechanistic investigation focuses on HIV-1 toxic proteins such as gp120 and Tat in eliciting neuroinflammation. However, given the low viral loads after ART, the pathogenic significance of the proteins remains uncertain. Since HIV patients need to stay on ART for a long time, we reason that it is clinically important to test the alternative possibility: anti- retroviral therapy itself evokes neuroinflammatory responses, even though it controls HIV viral loads at a low level and suppresses virus-induced immune responses. This hypothesized therapy-induced chronic neuroinflammation, if validated, may have a profound impact on the design of future ART regimens. In this study, we will focus on the potential involvement of drugs in the current ART, especially its backbone components - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Based on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that NRTIs critically contribute to the chronic neuroinflammation through a mechanism that involves Wnt5a up-regulation. Specifically, our hypothesis entails that NRTIs cause Wnt5a increase in the CNS, which then stimulates astrocytes to express pro-inflammatory factors. Chronic increase of the inflammatory mediators is expected to cause NeuroAIDS-related neuronal damage. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize NRTI-induced neuroinflammation in the CNS (Aim 1), elucidate the mechanism of NRTI- induced CNS neuroinflammation (Aim 2), and determine the pathophysiological role of NRTI-induced CNS neuroinflammation in pathological pain development (Aim 3). Successful completion of these conceptually innovative studies will significantly advance our understanding of the neuropathogenic mechanisms by which NRTIs/ART may contribute to neurological disorders in HIV patients. The new findings may lead to further optimization of ART in clinical settings and the development of ART adjuvants to prevent NeuroAIDS, such as chronic pain and cognitive deficits."
"9109527","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The large and unrelenting year-to-year growth in premiums (median increase of 14.6% a year among physician organizations in California) has led the Integrated Healthcare Association's multi-stakeholder group of health plans, purchasers, and physician organizations (POs) to replace their longstanding P4P program, which focused only on quality improvement, with a value-based purchasing (VBP) program that seeks to bend the cost curve and improve quality. The percent of revenue at risk will increase from the ~1% of capitation payment under P4P to ~8% of capitation payments under VBP. The program is slated to go into effect in 2013. Our study will evaluate the statewide IHA VBP plan, which has the potential to bend the cost curve, and will represent one of the largest VBP experiments in the U.S., targeting 200 POs that contract with six major health plans. By analyzing the behavioral response of POs to the new incentive structure, we will examine the critical national policy issue of whether, why, and under what circumstances VPB bends the cost curve. The outcomes we will evaluate longitudinally include changes in PO total costs of care (both cross-section and trend) and its component elements (pharmacy, ambulatory, hospital, and ancillary), quality performance, incentive payouts, and care delivery practices. Data for the project draws from multiple sources: total cost of care and quality performance data from IHA (derived from health plans and POs), incentive payments made to POs from health plans, and interview data that we collect from the POs. We will use statistical approaches to generate PO cost curves, investigate underlying cost drivers that explain various cost profiles, and examine PO behavioral responses to VBP that were associated with their ability to modify (or not modify) their cost trajectories ovr 4 years of exposure to the VBP. Cost curves provide information on cost levels as well as shape and orientation (i.e., trajectory), and we will track changes in PO cost curves over time."
"9234890","Project Summary Mitochondrial function declines with age and is exacerbated in disease states such as Parkinson's. One potential cause of the mitochondrial decline is the propagation of deleterious mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) throughout an organism's lifetime as has been observed in individual muscle cells or dopaminergic neurons. mtDNAs only encode respiratory chain and ATP synthase components and thus lesions result in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) deficiency. Because mtDNAs exist at 100s-1000s of copies per cell, a lesion in a single genome is well tolerated. However, if the deleterious genome accumulates to greater than ~60%, pathology related to OxPhos dysfunction ensues including cell degeneration and death. It is currently unclear how deleterious mtDNAs are maintained, how they are propagated and ultimately why they are toxic. One mechanism by which cells respond to OxPhos deficiency is by activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which initiates a mitochondrial repair and recovery program. We have found that UPRmt activation provides protection against OxPhos deficiencies caused by nuclear mutations in OxPhos genes or against bacterial derived toxins (P. aeruginosa produces cyanide for example). Our surprising preliminary data indicate that the UPRmt is required to maintain and propagate deleterious mtDNAs in a C. elegans model of heteroplasmy. Therefore, we hypothesize that deleterious mtDNAs are selfish, or parasitic, and take advantage of an endogenous stress response program in place to repair and respond to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we plan to examine the consequences of UPRmt activation and deleterious mtDNA propagation as a contributor to age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction."
"9273337","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss of  unmyelinated C-, small myelinated Ad- and autonomic fibers, and is associated with sensory and autonomic  dysfunctions, including burning, pin-prick and lancinating pain and autonomic symptoms, which are often  refractory to treatment.  SFN has been linked to multiple causes, including diabetes, alchoholism, toxins, including Agent Orange, HIV, anti-neoplastic treatments, and autoimmune disorders, but a substantial percentage of SFN are idiopathic, with no apparent cause.  We have recently demonstrated the presence of gain-of-function variants in sodium channel Nav1.7 in nearly 30% of patients with SFN and no other apparent cause.  However, the molecular cascade leading to small fiber loss and onset of pain associated with the gain- of-function variants in Nav1.7, or any of the multiple causes linked to SFN, is not yet understood.     The proposed Small Project is designed to develop an in vivo model of small fiber neuropathy by creating  knock-in mice with heterozygous insertion of a human gain-of-function variant in the Scn9a (Nav1.7) gene at  the Scn9a allelle.  Multiple gain-of-function variants in Nav1.7 have been found in patients with idiopathic SFN, and our electrophysiological and morphological studies of two variants (I228M and G856M) as exceptionally promising candidates in which to pursue generation of in vivo models. For our studies, knock-in mice are generated and phenotypically characterized by morphological, whole-cell patch clamp and behavioral methods.     In future studies not funded by this proposal, the knock-in mice will serve as valuable platforms in which to perform mechanistic studies to determine the molecular pathway(s) leading to axonal degeneration and the onset of sensory and autonomic dysfunction in SFN.  It is also anticipated that the development of the in vivo models will allow us to identify and test novel therapeutic approaches to minimize axonal degeneration, and the sensory and autonomic dysfunctions associated with fiber loss, in human small fiber neuropathy."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have called for SBIR projects that focus on support for Ebola Safety with a focus on virus transmission, disease prevention and control, and public health preparedness. This SBIR addresses this need with the educational product named Medical Unit Specialized Simulation Training (MUSST.)  MUSST contains 1) internet based self-study of the scientific background for high stakes infectious disease with special emphasis on the diagnosis, infectivity, transmission of the Ebola 2) a rapidly learned train the trainer internet self-administered component for hospital instructors to teach the course, 3) CDC and NIOSH guideline based safe practice protocols for 15 common simulated tasks for nurses, physicians and other unit workers, and 4) an automated scoring and data acquisition system that immediately grades and ranks performance of learners so that hospital leaders and administrators can insure their staff have learned and mastered the common tasks in a high risk unit. MUSST will standardize education and safe practices across the country keeping our healthcare workers safe and helping in the containment of deadly infectious disease.  In Phase I there are 2 distinct aims. Aim 1 is to create a comprehensive digital learning system based on current medical science, CDC and OSHA guidelines that teach teachers to educate their workforce in 15 common tasks and duties and provides automated scoring and ranking of performance of learner staff. A scientific advisory board with Ebola Viral Disease teaching and Mastery Education expertise will validate the content in Aim 1. Aim 2, using pilot testing of hospital worker volunteers, investigates the validity, effectiveness and reliability of the training modules learning system. The pilot studies test the discrimination validity, inter- rater reliability, and effectiveness of MUSST components. Phase II is essential to product development insuring that: 1) that the validity, reliability and effectiveness of MUSST are perfected and tested using power estimates learned in Phase I; 2) the software can run on the commonly available platforms at most hospitals; 3) that MUSST can be successfully used by workers at other hospitals and; 4) learn the decay of mastery learning ? determine how often workers have to undergo the simulation to stay safe.  Many forces in the market assure the success of this unrivaled educational product. Many hospitals cannot develop their own course and must purchase a valid product. Hospital regulatory agencies like OSHA and The Joint Commission have made the protection of workers and containment of Ebola a requirement. These forces along with product promotion by the firmly established corporate alliances of SimTunes with the largest high fidelity simulation manufacturer (Laerdal), the largest hospital educational content provider (HealthStream), and prior product success of SimTunes products all promise to insure success of MUSST."

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to conduct and monitor epidemiologic, clinical- and laboratory-based studies of important human diseases in Kenya. In collaboration with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), we are applying for Components A, B, C, D and E. For Component A, the Division of Global Health Protection, our proposal addresses, for example: surveillance for infectious zoonotic diseases in animals, covering causes of diseases in livestock and quantifying the linkages between the health of people and the animals with which they live; and the role of pathogens in acute febrile illness (AFI), characterizing the epidemiology, including seasonality of AFI. For Component B, our proposal covers, for example, identification of clinical, epidemiologic and nutritional characteristics of patients hospitalized with respiratory illness and risk factors, in settings like western Kenya, which may further predispose pregnant women to severe outcomes from influenza, especially in relationship to influenza vaccination. For Component C, we include proposed projects, such as determination of the effectiveness of patient delivered partner therapy in reducing Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea re-infection in conjunction with assessment of the prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. For Component D, for instance, we consider measuring schistosome antigens in oral fluid samples via detection of Circulating Cathodic Antigen (CCA) and present a sampling design to assess the therapeutic efficacy of Artemisinin-based combination therapies for symptomatic, uncomplicated P. falciparum infection among children. Finally, for Component E, for example, we propose a study to measure the effectiveness of three different strategies to increase the TB case detection rate compared to the standard approach, Directly Observed Treatment (DOTS) as implemented in Kenya. Each of our proposed projects is consistent with and beneficial to furthering CDC Kenya's mission to promote health through collaboration on science, policy and evidence-based public health actions. Collaborative public health research is HJFMRI's forte, and we offer our expertise in management to fulfill CDC strategic priorities."
"9129587","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hippocampus plays an essential role in the process of encoding working memory into long-term memory, an important aspect of learning. Multiple studies demonstrate that damage to the hippocampus produces learning deficits similar to those seen in learning disabilities, age-related memory loss, Alzheimer's disease, alcohol-related amnesic syndromes, and other amnesic syndromes. Although extensively studied, the mechanisms of neural encoding remain mysterious. Examining individual neurons has proven useful in better understanding this process. However, many studies confound learning and behavioral issues, making it hard to dissociate activity specific for learning. For this reason, a model that differentiates neural activity associated with learning is necessary for advancing our understanding of the hippocampus. In addition, we are interested in knowing how ethanol produces learning deficits by disrupting neural activity within the hippocampus. Using an animal model, the objective of this project is to: 1) characterize neural activity while subjects respond n a non-spatial operant learning procedure, 2) investigate the neural activity associated with learning by examining the information communication rate and phase shifts in neural unit activity, and 3) investigate the effects produced by ethanol administration. The operant learning procedure allows for both task-related neural activity and nonspecific behavioral effects to be differentiated from learning, as subject learn a new task and perform a previously learned task within the same test setting. To further examine the process of learning, information theory will be applied to estimate the amount of information being communicated by neurons. We hypothesize that the amount of information communicated by neurons recorded in the hippocampus during a learning task is higher than observed during a previously learned task and that the information rate during both tasks decreases when subjects are exposed to ethanol. Additionally, we will characterize shifts in the phase of neural unit activity within the hippocampal theta rhythm cycle. We hypothesize that a phase shift to an earlier time in the theta rhythm occurs as subjects learn to responds during the operant procedure and that phase shifts are disrupted when subjects are exposed to ethanol. Together, these aims will provide novel insight into the role of the hippocampus during learning and the effects of ethanol on learning. A better understanding will also shed light on the mechanisms responsible for producing deficits in learning, and will aide in the development of therapies aimed at attenuating organic or drug-induced learning deficits."

"9037401","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to investigate the effect of children's early language exposure on the neural mechanisms underlying language development. Neuroscience research provides increasing evidence that early experiences interact with genes to shape the brain and its functioning. Though the brain remains plastic throughout life, many critical neural circuits, such as those for language and communication, are established during sensitive periods in the first few years of life, after which new learning is more difficult to accomplish. Furthermore, abundant child development research reveals that both the quantity and quality of a child's language exposure during this sensitive period impacts his/her linguistic and cognitive abilities throughout life, and that parents from lower socioeconomic status (SES; a combination of education, occupation, and income) backgrounds tend to speak fewer and lower quality utterances to their children. Currently, there is work linkin neural structure and function with distal social contexts such as SES; however, there is no research examining the effect of more malleable proximal social contexts, such daily language exposure, on the brain. This is not a trivial gap, because proximal environments are the most amenable to intervention. I will investigate this experience-brain connection in an SES-diverse sample of five-year-old children and their parents. I will record an entire day of the child's auditory exposure from his/her perspective, and then analyze the recording for the quantity of language input (total number of adult words and conversational turns) and the quality of language input (the diversity and sophistication of vocabulary/grammar). Children and parents will also complete standardized behavioral assessments of their language facility and cognitive skills, and children will participate in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion  tensor imaging (DTI). I will test the hypothesis that, controlling for SES, reported stress levels,  and other non-linguistic environmental factors, the quantity and quality of children's linguistic input will have a significant and separable effect on their (1) behavioral linguistic abilities, (2 pattern of neural activation during a sentence comprehension task, and (3) hemispheric asymmetry in the gray and white matter supporting the canonical language network of the brain (left inferior frontal and superior temporal regions). Furthermore, I will compare across SES groups to see if low-SES children exhibit stronger input-output relationships, which would highlight the importance of language experience in at-risk populations, and I will look within the low-SES group specifically to explore which aspect of language stimulation (quantity, quality, or both) most facilitates linguistic and cognitive development, despite environmental risks. In sum, this is an innovative approach to directly relate daily experience to the developing brain in order  to elucidate factors contributing to drastic SES-related differences language and cognitive abilities. Importantly, the results will shed light on a malleable experiential factor and early intervention target that may transcend these group-level trends to shape both brain and behavior."
"9334406","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic painful disorder that is the most frequent cause of mobility disability in older people. The MOST study has been a major source of new knowledge about the course of this disease and factors that affect its course. Since the study began in 2003, it is increasingly recognized that by the time people develop chronic symptoms of knee OA, they usually have advanced structural findings of disease on MRI. Findings such as meniscal tears, malalignment and cartilage loss drive further structural deterioration and almost certainly limit prevention opportunities. We believe that prevention opportunities are likely to be greater if started in those who do not yet have severe continuous knee pain or advanced structural findings of disease. The functional impacts of knee OA occur in older people who experience multiple musculoskeletal comorbidities, and preventing disablement from OA requires a broader perspective than a focus on a single knee. For example, those with pain in one knee are at high risk of pain in other lower extremity musculoskeletal regions and, even if the knee is replaced, they may ultimately need treatment for pain in other joints developing as a consequence of the first joint affected. Also, in additionto functional loss, persons with OA experience buckling, falls and constraints in their involvement with the outside environment. We suggest there are opportunities to develop treatments and disease prevention strategies that have been unexplored and that by using new technologies and focusing on persons at a milder or earlier disease stage than previous studies, we can identify such opportunities. We propose to recruit a new mild disease cohort and continue to study the existing MOST cohort to identify new risk factors for disease and to study consequences of disease. Our goal is to find new strategies to prevent disease at an early stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred."
"9355449","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Universal three-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected women offers many advantages in terms of preventing HIV transmission to children, safer breastfeeding, improved maternal health, reduced sexual transmission of HIV, and simplified treatment programs. Safety of increased ART exposure during pregnancy and conception for mothers and their children is not fully established, and there are concerns about maternal adherence and program effectiveness. Investigating the impact of these changes is complex due to weak clinical and information systems in many settings, rapidly changing guidelines and service realities, and difficulty ensuring long term follow-up of sufficient numbers of children to exclude potential harmful effects.  The current HIV antenatal seroprevalence in the Western Cape province of South Africa is 19% with vertical transmission of HIV estimated at 2%. Providing maternity care to 100,000 mothers a year, the province has a long history of innovation in PMTCT programs; recently introducing life-long universal ART for HIV- infected pregnant or breast-feeding women. The province is uniquely placed to comprehensively evaluate this guideline change due to the availability of electronic data on the ART program, and the ability to link via a unique health identifier to a range of other datasets to improve follow-u, ascertainment of pregnancy and ART exposure, laboratory values, vital status data and other outcomes.  This proposal seeks to evaluate the impact of the guideline change on: 1) the effectiveness of PMTCT and ART programs for participating women based; 2) the impact of increased ART exposure antenatally and around conception on maternal and perinatal health outcomes; 3) the impact on child health outcomes for children exposed in utero to ART; and finally 4) the impact on the governmental ART program and on the epidemic itself.  At each level of evaluation, a population-based province-wide activity is paired with a sentinel site activity which probes clinical and operational issues in greater depth. All of the sentinel site activities are located in the same sites to improve operational efficiency, while all of the province-wide data activities will be undertaken by a single team. Program effectiveness will be assessed both through cohort analyses of the entire provincial ART cohort of 35,000 adult patients starting ART each year, and a detailed cohort study of 900 women in the sentinel site. Maternal and perinatal health outcomes will be assessed through provincial mortality reporting and perinatal audits which both have high levels of completeness, complimented by participation at the sentinel site in the national pregnancy exposure (PER) register and birth defects surveillance register. Post-neonatal child health outcomes will be tracked through hospital admissions, which for children from the PER, will be reviewed to verify discharge diagnoses. Program and epidemic impact will be explored through mathematical modeling based on a new country level HIV and demographic model."
"9193856","Project Summary/Abstract   Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in children. Almost half of all new CP diagnoses are made in children who were born preterm. Although CP results from abnormal development or injury of the brain during the fetal or neonatal period, children with CP typically do not receive a diagnosis until 2 years of age. These first 2 years are critical for neuroplasticity, when proven habilitative interventions could restore motor function. Our strong preliminary data suggest that early and accurate individualized prediction of CP is possible by using a combination of advanced brain MRI biomarkers at term corrected age (CA). We have developed reliable methods for measuring structural and functional connectivity in neonates using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), respectively. These methods can sensitively diagnose reduced neuronal connectivity, even in infants with a normal-appearing structural MRI (sMRI) that later develop CP. We have found that a combination of 3 sensorimotor network biomarkers correctly classified 98% of preterm infants with or without CP. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the value of brain connectivity biomarkers, individually and in combination, to accurately diagnose CP within 3 months of birth. We propose a large multicenter prospective cohort study in very preterm infants (?31 weeks gestational age), using advanced MRI at term CA and developmental testing at 1 and 2 years CA. Our central hypothesis is that CP is a disorder of reduced sensorimotor network connectivity, and sensitive diagnosis of this reduced connectivity using advanced MRI at term CA will result in early and accurate prediction of CP. Diagnosis of CP soon after birth will guide the prescription and refinement of early, evidence-based sensorimotor interventions and novel neuroprotective therapies to enable improved outcomes in children with CP. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: (1) To differentiate regional and global structural and functional connectivity at term CA in infants with a normal sMRI who develop CP, compared to infants who do not; (2) To define the prognostic test properties of structural connectivity biomarkers at term CA, independently and in combined multivariable models, and identify the model that most accurately enables personalized prediction of CP in very preterm infants. Under the first aim, we will perform dMRI tractography of 6 sensorimotor tracts and evaluate regional and global brain connectivity using graph theory measures. For the second aim, we will evaluate promising connectivity biomarkers to identify the most significant multivariable model for individualized prediction of CP. The approach is innovative because it will integrate advances in neuroimaging with established epidemiologic principles to elucidate pathophysiology and accurately predict CP within 3 months of birth in a large population of very preterm infants. The proposed research is significant because it will reduce the time to diagnosis of CP by 2 years so that early intervention resources and biologically based therapies can be targeted to the highest risk infants during a period of optimal neuroplasticity for reducing future impairments.  "
"9206245","Biomedical research and practice, from cell biology to clinical pathology relies on imaging cells and tissues and the molecules they express. However, while sequencing is now used extensively to profile genomes, transcriptomes and interactions in bulk samples and single cells, it typically cannot resolve the spatial organization of these profiles. This leads to an ever-widening gap between genomics and cell biology and histopathology. There is thus an enormous need for methods that would collect spatially resolved genomics data. Unfortunately, even the most recent technological advances for spatial genomics still face major barriers and cannot be broadly adopted, as they either require costly, specialized and slow imaging equipment, yield data of limited quality or cannot handle idiosyncratic samples like tumors. Here, we propose a completely novel approach ? DNA microscopy ? as a new, scalable, cost-effective, general method for spatial genomics in cells, tissue sections, and whole tissues. DNA microscopy encodes spatial organization into a DNA library, sequences it using standard sequencing, and infers the relative position of RNA, DNA or other molecules using inference algorithms. DNA microscopy relies on a novel PCR-based approach that leads to encoded spatial information just based on the laws of diffusion: the closer two molecules were in the original sample, the more likely they are to have a joint product in the DNA microscopy reaction. Following sequencing, an image is recovered by computation on this information. In preliminary results we provide an end-to-end demonstration that DNA microscopy recovers accurate images, without any optical microscopy, and without any prior knowledge on tissues, cells or their organization. Here, we will develop, expand and disseminate DNA microscopy to a broad utility tool, especially with clinical pathology samples. We will develop DNA microscopy to read out the spatial distribution of sets of transcripts in a biological sample and validate it across diverse cell lines and primary cells (Aim 1). We will extend DNA microscopy for spatial profiling of whole transcriptome profiling with randomized and oligonucleotide-library priming strategies, and of epigenomic markers using antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates targeting methylated DNA cytosine and specific acetylated histones (Aim 2). We will maximize DNA microscopy's impact by adapting it for spatial transcript analysis of signatures and whole transcriptomes in 2D tissue sections and in whole mount (3D) tissue (Aim 3), demonstrating successful analysis in diverse tissues, including brain and human tumors. We will disseminate DNA microcopy broadly to users in research or pathology labs (Aim 4). The reagents we use and the protocols we invented are straightforward, and we will facilitate dissemination by distributing reaction chambers to other labs, releasing software, and conducting outreach. DNA microscopy does not require special or costly equipment, relies on PCR protocols that can be easily adopted in any lab, and will handle cells, tissue sections, and whole tissue, thus maximizing its transformative impact on science and the clinic."
"9106643","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying stabilizers of p53 using pocket complementarity.  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is mutated or deleted in more than half of human cancers. The most frequently occurring of these loss-of-function mutations are localized to the p53 core domain, but do not involve surface residues directly responsible for function. Rather, these point mutants reduce the thermodynamic stability of this marginally stable protein, such that cellular activity is diminished because an insufficient amount of p53 is correctly folded The goal of this proposal is to identify compounds that potently bind and stabilize correctly folded p53. We expect that stabilization through this mechanism will restore activity to this most frequently occurring class of p53 point mutants, and further will restore activity to these destabilized mutants - regardless of precisely which mutation is responsible for the underlying loss of protein stability.  Already we have identified several stabilizing compounds from a small pilot screen, and we find that these compounds can restore transcriptional activity in cell lines harboring destabilized mutants of p53. Our central hypothesis is that by extending the scope of our computational studies and optimizing the resulting hit compounds through medicinal chemistry, we will identify compounds that act even more potently. We propose to meet this objective through pursuit of the following specific aims: 1) Use cutting-edge computational methods to identify compounds that bind to p53. 2) Test predicted hits in vitro using direct stability assays. 3) Optimize validated hits using structure-guided medicinal chemistry.  Conventional approaches to identify compounds that stabilize p53 by binding to new surface sites might entail structure-based virtual screening, coupled with biochemical screening of the predicted hits. Each of these approaches would be expected to encounter particular hurdles when applied to this problem: the primary innovations in the proposed research lie in our use of newly-developed tools from the Karanicolas and Fisher labs to address each of these specific challenges.  Using these tools we expect to identify a set of novel p53 re-activators, which in turn may represent a starting point for developing a new class of broad-spectrum cancer therapeutics. We further expect that refinement of our screening platform through these studies of p53 will additionally enhance its utility for identifying re-activators of other select proteinsthat are frequently deactivated in human cancers by destabilizing mutations."
"9234800","Recent studies demonstrate that the hypothalamus functions as a high-order ?control center of aging?, counteracting age-associated pathophysiological changes and thereby promoting longevity in mammals. Our group demonstrated that the mammalian NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 in the hypothalamus, particularly the dorsomedial and lateral hypothalamic nuclei (DMH and LH, respectively), is critical to counteract age-associated physiological decline and promote longevity in mice. In the DMH, SIRT1 and its binding partner Nkx2-1 highly colocalize, allowing us to identify a specific subset of DMH neurons, namely, SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive neurons. Recently, we have identified a set of genes specifically expressed in these SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive DMH neurons. One of these genes is Prdm13, which encodes a member of the PR domain family of transcriptional regulators. Prdm13 is one of the downstream target genes regulated by SIRT1 and Nkx2-1 in the DMH. DMH-specific Prdm13-knockdown mice exhibit decreased sleep quality, increased adiposity, and reduction in adipose Nampt, a key systemic NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme secreted from adipose tissue to remotely regulate hypothalamic function. On the other hand, we found that the DMH- specific knockdown of the thyrotoropin-releasing hormone (Trh) gene, another gene highly and selectively expressed in the SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive DMH neurons, caused defects in skeletal muscle mitochondrial gene expression, specific myokine expression, and physical activity. These results suggest that SIRT1/Nkx2-1-double positive DMH neurons contain at least two functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations, namely, Prdm13- and Trh-positive neurons, and that each subpopulation regulates distinct inter-tissue feedback loops between the hypothalamus and adipose tissue or skeletal muscle. In this research proposal, we will extensively investigate the physiological importance of these two inter-tissue feedback loops. We will also examine whether maintaining the activity of these feedback loops can counteract age-associated pathophysiological changes and possibly extend lifespan in mice. The anticipated outcome from the proposed research will make a significant impact to our understanding of the systemic regulation of aging and longevity in mammals."
"8998416","Project Summary  The Hematologic Malignancies (HM) Program, which received ?Outstanding to Exceptional? merit in the 2010  CCSG renewal, was established in 1994 to translate basic scientific discoveries into novel therapeutics for  patients with myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. The Program has two scientific aims. They are to: 1) Develop a  mechanisms-based understanding of the genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes regulating normal and  malignant hematopoiesis, and 2) Translate basic scientific discoveries into more effective and manageable  therapies. Thematic areas include transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic regulation of normal and  malignant hematopoietic cells; signal transduction in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells; molecular  therapeutics; hematopoietic stem cell biology and transplantation; and immune-based therapies. Program  members are extensive users of CCSG-supported resources (e.g., Clinical Protocol and Data Management,  Biostatistics Core, Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility, Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility, and  Human Immunology Core) and have extensive collaborations with other Abramson Cancer Center Programs  including Cancer Control, Cancer Therapeutics, Immunobiology, Melanoma and Cutaneous Malignancies,  Radiobiology and Imaging, and Pediatric Oncology. The Program is Co-Led by Dr. Edward Stadtmauer, an  expert in clinical trials of novel therapeutics for hematologic malignancies and bone marrow transplantation,  and Dr. Nancy Speck, an internationally known basic scientist working in the area of hematopoietic stem cells  and leukemia. The Program's 21 members come from five departments (Medicine, Pediatrics, Genetics,  Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Cell and Developmental Biology) in the Perelman School of Medicine.  An innovative Hematologic Malignancies Translational Center of Excellence co-led by Dr. Stadtmauer has  catalyzed an already successful Program by adding laboratory, tissue banking, and clinical research personnel  resources as well as pilot grant funding. Prominent examples of Program advances include the demonstration  by Dr. Blobel that the formation of chromatin loops directly activates transcription of globin genes, the  demonstration by Dr. Tong that interaction of the cytokine signaling regulator Lnk with JAK2 is regulated by the  14-3-3 proteins, the reduction of graft versus host disease by CCR5 blockade, reported by a new member, Dr.  Reshef and colleagues, and the application of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) modified T-cell therapy for  CLL and B-cell ALL, led by Dr. Porter. Weekly seminars, collaborative grant submissions, weekly clinical  working group meetings, and an annual research retreat organized by Drs. Speck and Stadtmauer facilitate  member interactions. Currently, members have research funding totaling $6.7M (annual direct costs) of which  $5M is peer-reviewed and $2.4M is from the NCI. During the project period, members published 358 cancer-  relevant publications, of which 18% were intra-Programmatic, 20% were inter-Programmatic and 64% were  multi-institutional."
"9232903","Project Summary:  Although most of the transcripts produced from the human genome do not encode for proteins, the vast majority of non-coding RNAs remains completely understood. A newly appreciated class of non-coding RNAs are circular RNAs (circRNAs). In both Drosophila melanogaster and mice, circRNAs tend to emanate from genes with known neural functions and their expression is enriched in neural tissue. This suggests they might have functions in the nervous system. Recent work has found thousands of circRNAs to be expressed in mice and Drosophila; however, their functional relevance has only started to be explored. In Drosophila, we found that hundreds of circRNAs accumulate during normal aging in the fly head. Drosophila is a powerful system to study aging and age-related disorders of the nervous system.  We hypothesize that this progressive accumulation of circRNAs in the brain contributes to age-related decline in neural function. Preliminary data shows that circRNA accumulation during aging can be modulated by environmental stresses, including temperature and caloric intake- all conditions that can modulate lifespan in Drosophila. In Aim 1 we propose to characterize the regulation of circRNAs globally during biological aging in brain neurons using RNA-seq analysis. In Aim 2, the functional elements enriched in age-accumulated and X16 regulated circRNAs will be investigated. Finally, in Aim 3, the function of X16 suppression of ank2 circRNA will be investigated by assessing lifespan, neuromuscular junction morphology and heat stress resistance.  Preliminary data shows that circRNAs accumulated during aging in other organisms, including mice, making it likely that this accumulation also occurs in the human brain. Insights into the mechanism of circRNA accumulation during aging gleaned from Drosophila will thus likely be applicable to understanding circRNAs in the human brain. Given the health impact of age-related neurodegenerative disease in the US population it is important to understand the fundamental biology of this novel class of RNAs with likely functions in the aging brain."
"9169410","The association between smoking and suicide has been repeatedly documented, yet the proposition that smoking contributes directly to suicide risk is controversial and definitive evidence remains elusive. However, a growing body of research suggests that smoking may directly increase risk for psychiatric disorders, which would likely increase suicide risk. The global aim of this proposal is to examine whether smoking is a contributing cause for suicide and more proximal adverse mental health outcomes. We will leverage state tobacco control policy changes as natural experiments that lead to reduced prevalence of smoking. We propose that, as a result of their influence on smoking, these policy interventions also influence risk for suicide and mental health problems, including substance misuse. We will examine whether strengthening of tobacco control policies results in reduced risk for suicide and for adverse mental health outcomes. Furthermore, we will examine whether these associations are specific to smokers, as predicted by our model. We discuss our proof-of-concept study, which shows that strengthening of state tobacco control policies corresponds to reductions in suicide risk. We propose a three-year study that seeks to extend this finding using data on over one million survey participants with smoking measurements and prospective mortality follow-up. This will enable a much a much stronger analytical design than our initial study. We will also examine the associations of tobacco policy changes with psychiatric disorders and other adverse mental health outcomes, including suicidal behavior. This will enable us to identify specific channels through which smoking might influence mental health. We will take advantage of large, nationally representative epidemiological data to conduct these analyses and apply sophisticated analytic techniques that reduce the role of observed and unobserved confounders. These studies would have substantial impact on science by being a part of an emerging body of work that is challenging the traditional interpretation of the smoking-mental health link being due to ?self-medication.? This work will also have impact on public health and policy by providing key parameters to cost/benefit analyses of tobacco control policies. Confirmation of our hypotheses could result in increased awareness of the importance of smoking cessation for mental health patients, and also prompt basic researchers to more closely scrutinize the influence of nicotine on phenotypes relevant to mental health. This latter contribution could be critical as emerging tobacco products grow in popularity."
"9126903","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as a promising treatment option for a variety of diseases, including those afflicting the cardiovascular system. Unfortunately, humoral immune responses against the AAV capsid prevent the ability to re-administer the viral vector as needed. In addition to the anti- AAV capsi antibody responses, tissue targeting is another major hurdle to effective cardiac gene therapy. Previously, we designed a Protease-Activatable Virus (PAV) based on AAV that is stimulated by overexpressed matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in diseased tissues. Although the PAVs may enable more targeted delivery to sites of disease, they will also suffer from antibody responses against the capsid just like the unengineered vectors. To overcome this problem, I hypothesize that genetically inserting a `self-peptide' into the PAV capsid (PAV-SP) will minimize phagocytic uptake, ultimately decreasing neutralizing antibody production. The aims of this fellowship project are the following: 1) genetically clone and structurally characterize PAV-SP and 2) functionally characterize PAV-SP with in vitro models."
"9349041","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Gastric contractions are initiated and coordinated by an underlying bioelectrical activity termed slow waves (SWs).  Aberrant SW patterns (dysrhythmias) have been associated with gastric dysmotility in several significant gastric disorders, notably gastroparesis (GP) and functional dyspepsia.  There are also well- documented associations between GP and damage to the vagus nerve that are common in people with diabetes.  Gastric pacing and vagus nerve stimulation have been proposed as treatment modalities for gastric dysrhythmia.  However, the pathophysiological roles of electrical dysrhythmias and neural mechanisms in gastric motility disorders, and the role and therapeutic potential of the vagus and gastric electrical stimulation remain weakly defined.  This is mainly due to the lack of technologies that can reveal the mechanisms of action.  Electroneurogram (ENG) signals obtained through cuff electrodes from the peripheral nerves have been shown to provide valuable information regarding operation of afferent and efferent nerves.  Compared to microelectrodes, cuff electrodes are minimally invasive and provide stable recordings long-term.  These signals have been used to study neuromuscular, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.  The ENG signal is most informative when it can be associated with the function of the end organ.  When studying conscious freely-behaving subjects, this requires implantable devices that can simultaneously acquire ENG and associated organ functions.  To fully understand the underlying mechanisms of action of gastric pacing and neuromodulation therapies for functional motility disorders, a tool that can map and monitor-in high resolution-the coordinated activity of gastric SWs and ENG signals from peripheral nerves such as vagal branches innervating the stomach in real time would be invaluable.  Gastric SWs directly recorded from the stomach serosa provide the only reliable and descriptive source of data on spatial dysrhythmic patterns.  However, a key limitation is that wires traverse the abdominal wall or a natural orifice, posing risks of discomfort, dislodgement, or infection.  We propose to develop and validate, in a porcine model, a Wireless Implantable Neuro- Gastroenterology System (WINGS) that can simultaneously acquire SWs and compound action potentials from the gastric peripheral nerves and map these signals in high resolution.  The system consists of an implantable system-on-chip to condition and wirelessly transmit the signals, a wearable unit to wirelessly recharge the implant and relay the signals, and a receiver connected to a computer to display, store, and process the data.  With its dual capability to monitor ENGs and SWs, WINGS can be implanted laparoscopically or endoscopically via a single minimally invasive procedure.  Because the two types of signals will be acquired by one device, their precise timing will be known, and no synchronization will be required."
"9042548","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Ebola virus that causes hemorrhagic fever is a major threat to public health and a potential bioterrorism agent. There is an urgent need for new approaches to prevention and treatment of this disease both in the near and long term. Currently there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic treatments for infection with these viruses. However, a large body of work has resulted in a number of promising candidate vaccines. These candidates are currently moving into human trials and are likely to be approved for widespread use in the near future. However, these candidates are expected to require a cold chain and trained medical personnel for administration. This can be a significant challenge in remote underdeveloped areas. Most of the problems in administering vaccines could be greatly reduced if a safe thermostable oral vaccine could be developed that eliminated the costs associated with administration by trained medical personnel and allowed for rapid dissemination among at-risk populations. One approach that has the potential to meet these objectives is a low-cost, plant-produced oral vaccine. In particular, a system using transgenic maize has emerged that has shown the characteristics needed to overcome previous limitations. This system has been used on other vaccine candidates and the work described here is aimed at developing it for use with an Ebola vaccine. The completion of Phase I should provide proof-of-concept that expression of immunogenic Ebola proteins in maize can elicit an immune response in mice. Successful completion of this work will eventually lead to the production of low cost orally delivered Ebola vaccines that do not require a cold chain."
"9114898","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) hold great promise as a means of providing a noninvasive window into the status of the cochlea that can both advance our scientific knowledge about cochlear function, and contribute a rapid test of hearing impairment to the clinical armamentarium. However, when measured at recommended primary-tone levels of about f1=65 and f2=55 dB SPL in patients with sensorineural hearing loss such as Veterans, poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) often make clinical interpretations difficult. DPOAEs elicited by higher primary levels have better SNRs, but are both less sensitive and less frequency specific due to the associated basal spread of both excitation and DPOAE components. If these shortcomings could be overcome, the applicability of DPOAEs in the clinic would be greatly enhanced. The primary significance of the proposed program of research is to further our knowledge of ear-canal DPOAEs vs intracochlear DPs (iDPs) to improve DP-grams measured at moderate to high primary-tone levels for clinical purposes by: 1) understanding the basis of the apparent increase in frequency specificity of the ¿-oct IT procedure by simultaneous measures of both the DPOAE and direct observations of the effects of the IT on f2 and iDP near the basilar membrane (BM) in a gerbil model; 2) comparing these intracochlear measures to those obtained with a noninvasive iDP technique where an f3 tone is paired with the iDP to produce a DPOAE´ used to infer the behavior of the iDP. This comparison will establish the validity of the noninvasive ear-canal method for examining the behavior of iDPs, and determine the differences between DPOAEs and iDPs; and 3) simultaneously measuring the response/growth or input/output functions for both the ear-canal DPOAE´ and the iDP using direct intracochlear pressure measures near the BM. With this approach, transfer functions for the DPOAE´ can be developed that predict the behavior of the iDP inside the cochlea. The planned studies will also compare the performance of the standard DP-gram procedure to two new procedures, the ¿-oct IT DP- gram and the iDP-gram in a population of Veterans with noise-induced audiometric notches in the 4- to 6-kHz range. On the whole, the premise of the proposed experiments is that by determining the differences between conventional ear-canal DPOAEs and iDPs generated within the cochlea, a means towards improving the frequency specificity of clinical DP-gram tests obtained with moderate- to high-level primary tones will be provided. Accomplishing a more frequency-specific DP-gram will allow clinicians to reliably establish the pattern of outer hair cell damage using high-level primary tones to achieve adequate SNRs in Veterans with sensorineural hearing loss."

"9161060","The use of synthetic psychoactive cathinone drugs (?bathsalts?) continues to expand worldwide and in the United States of America despite legal control efforts internationally, at the US federal level, within multiple US states and even the local US jurisdictions. The established stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are highly addictive, can be acutely lethal and can result in long- term brain alterations with many implications for health and well-being. Recent studies show that 3,4- methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a highly potent and efficacious reinforcer, predicting abuse liability equal to or greater than that of cocaine and methamphetamine. Compounds such as Mephedrone and Methylone produce subjective properties that are similar to 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) but have exhibit much greater propensity for compulsive use in human report and rodent self-administration studies. This project responds to the goals of PAR-14-106 Synthetic Psychoactive Drugs and Strategic Approaches to Counteract Their Deleterious Effects by determining structural determinants of the addiction liability of synthetic cathinones. Tremendous diversity of cathinone structure exists in the recreational market, driven in part by legal control of earlier-appearing drugs. This reality demands approaches which can both advance understanding of the actions of currently popular drugs and generate better predictions regarding which design motifs may convey increased abuse liability in emerging compounds. To that end, studies under Aim I and Aim II will elucidate the contributions of the 3,4-methylenedioxy and 4- methyl aromatic ring substitutions, respectively, to the reinforcement potency and efficacy of cathinones. One distinct feature of MDPV is an extended carbon chain which confers enhanced lipophilicity. The goal of Aim III is to determine if stimulant drug efficacy in intravenous self- administration is affected by lipophilicity, which affects speed of brain entry. In total, these proposed studies on the reinforcing effects of various synthetic cathinones will advance our understanding of the health risks associated with designer stimulant drugs."
"9253682","Native American Cancer Initiatives, Inc. (NACI) is a woman-owned, minority (American Indian) business with fewer than three full-time-equivalent employees. This for-profit company, founded in 1998, has the mission to provide technical assistance and products to communities, patients, researchers, academicians, universities, research institutions, and professionals on Native Americans, cultural issues, program development and assessment, evaluation and cancer care across the continuum (prevention through end-of-life care). The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a fully functioning tablet app focused on the Survivorship phase of the cancer care continuum that will allow PNs to easily document activities and interactions.  Data collected through implementation of the proposed app can subsequently be used to document, track and evaluate the effectiveness of PN activities, interactions and outcomes and their impact on access to timely, efficient and equitable health care services, leading to more rigorous evidence-based programs. A portable application would allow PNs to document their activities with patients in real time and also allow their supervisors and program administrators to assess the impact of these activities. This Phase I study addresses the research question, ?Can an existing online patient navigation documentation and evaluation program be modified to create an easy to use tablet app that can track a PN's activities with cancer survivors, function in multiple settings, and produce data that can be used for COC and other appropriate navigation accreditation?? The Specific Aims are: 1. Gather input from an Expert Advisory Panel, a Patient Navigator Advisory Committee, ten key informant  interviews and a focus group to provide input needed to adapt survivorship components of NACR's existing  online patient navigation documentation and evaluation program for development of a tablet app prototype. 2. Conduct 3 usability tests to determine ease-of-use, comprehensiveness, effectiveness, and usefulness of  the fully functioning tablet app for patient navigation documentation and evaluation. 3. Based upon Expert Advisory Panel consensus and Patient Navigator Advisory Committee guidance,  determine the feasibility of the tablet app for expansion in Phase II. The outcome for Phase I will be the feasibility assessment of a prototype tablet app that (a) makes data input easier and more accurate, ensuring systematic data collection; (b) allows for real-time summaries specific to individual patients; (c) allows program administrators to monitor PN interactions and produce a summary of activities documenting PN value; (d) documents activities for billing; and (e) collects patient perspectives on navigation services. The proposed project has the potential to improve patient navigation documentation and program evaluation activities to enhance accountability and evidence of success that can influence health care policies and reduce health inequities."
"9157676","Abstract Antivascular ultrasound is a novel approach that uses low-amplitude ultrasound and microbubbles to treat cancers. In the presence of ultrasound irradiation, microbubbles act as microscopic sources that convert acoustic energy into heat through viscous damping of oscillating bubbles. The localized intravascular heating damages endothelial cells and disrupt tumor vasculature. Thus microbubbles function as both energy source and ultrasound wave beacons to deliver acoustic energy locally to the vascular endothelium. The goals of the research are to model ultrasound-enhanced heating mathematically and to use the model to guide the synthesis of microbubbles using novel microfluidics techniques. The proposal has three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to use computational modeling to identify mechanical properties and bubble size distribution that produce maximum thermal effects. Specific Aim 2 will be to synthesize microbubbles of desired size distribution and shell properties. Specific Aim 3 will test the efficacy of microbubble preparations in flow phantoms and preclinical animal model. The experimental results will be compared with theoretical calculations. Thus both mathematical modeling and the unique method of synthesis will provide an integrated approach for antivascular therapy. The proposed research develops a completely new ultrasound cancer treatment with significant advantages over existing techniques. We anticipate that the knowledge gained from the proposed research will lead to a new form of antivascular therapy for treating cancers."
"9212218","PROJECT SUMMARY The involvement of skilled bioethicists is necessary for the success of research in the basic and translational sciences. In particular, research that is conducted to reduce the burdens caused by the racial disparities in cancer incidence requires bioethical guidance. For these reasons, the Bioethics Shared Resource (BESR) is an integral component of this Partnership. For full/pilot projects, the BESR provides consultation and collaborative support regarding ethical issues from design to implementation and assists in the development of grant proposals, abstracts, and manuscripts. In addition to its work supporting the research of Partnership investigators, the BESR enhances the bioethical capabilities of the Partnership participants. This is accomplished by providing education in bioethics to investigators, junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, medical residents, graduate/undergraduate and medical students, community health advisors, navigators, partners, and other Partnership personnel regarding sound applications of bioethical principles in cancer research. The BESR provides bioethical education through the Research Education Core of the Partnership and, at TU, collaborates in teaching the graduate/undergraduate courses in bioethics in research, health disparities, and health policy. Bioethics support is essential for enhancing of the basic and translational research of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership."
"9146893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Errors in medical documents represent a critical issue that can adversely affect healthcare quality and safety. Physician use of speech recognition (SR) technology has risen in recent years due to its ease of use and efficiency at the point of care. However, high error rates, upwards of 10-23%, have been observed in SR-generated medical documents. Error correction and content editing can be time consuming for clinicians. A solution to this problem is to improve accuracy through automated error detection using natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) build a large corpus of clinical documents dictated via SR across different healthcare institutions and clinical settings; 2) conduct error analysis to estimate the prevalence and severity of SR errors; 3) develop innovative methods based on NLP for automated error detection and correction and create a comprehensive knowledge base that contains confusion sets, error frequencies and other error patterns; 4) evaluate the performance of the proposed methods and tool; and 5) distribute our methods and findings to make them available to other researchers.  We believe this application aligns with AHRQ's HIT and Patient Safety portfolios as well as AHRQ's Special Emphasis Notice to support projects to generate new evidence on health IT system safety (NOT- HS-15-005)."
"9148202","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroscience has an essential requirement for large-scale neural recording technologies to ensure rapid progress in the understanding of brain function, diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. At present, a large gap exists between the localized optical microscopy studies looking at fast neuronal activities at single cell resolution level and the whole-brain observations of slow hemodynamics and brain metabolism provided by the macroscopic imaging modalities. The proposed two-year project is aimed at developing novel optoacoustic neuroimaging tool to volumetrically monitor activity of large distributed neuronal populations with unprecedented temporal resolution in the millisecond range. This goal will be accomplished by constructing a tomographic optoacoustic scanner to simultaneously record three- dimensional optoacoustic data in a spherical geometry. The high temporal resolution in volumetric recordings will make it possible to directly track action potentials using fast voltage-sensitive indicators. The resulting scanner will simultaneously record activity from large fields of view in scattering brains, potentially reaching the mouse hippocampus and beyond. Rapid tuning of the excitation laser wavelength will be further employed to enable simultaneous acquisition of five-dimensional (i.e. real-time volumetric multi- spectral) optoacoustic data, which will provide enhanced sensitivity in detecting rapid spectral variations of the activity reporters. The plan of action includes screening of several potential candidates for voltage imaging, including genetic indicators, using neuronal cell cultures. System validation will be subsequently performed in isolated scattering brains of adult zebrafish and mice, aiming at establishing sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution metrics in detecting voltage signal transients due to spontaneous and stimulus- driven activity patterns. While the major importance of 3D optical microscopy techniques like two-photon imaging has been highlighted recently within the BRAIN initiative, they are generally limited to looking at small (~1mm3) superficially-located volumes with relatively slow temporal resolution, further requiring highly invasive cranial windows that can alter activity. In contrast, the proposed method is tailored for non-invasive deep brain observations and is ideal for simultaneous imaging of large fields of view at rapid volumetric frame rates and resolution approaching cellular scale. Furthermore, other optoacoustic approaches looked so far only at hemodynamic changes and blood oxygenation, slow and indirect indicators of brain activity. The proposed study will be the first to examine fast optoacoustic signatures of voltage-sensitive indicators, thus shattering the longstanding penetration barrier of optical microscopy in scattering brains."
"9136072","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to reduce foodborne illness associated with commercial food establishments in Minnesota and the entire U.S. Specific aims are to: 1) increase and improve environmental assessments conducted during foodborne illness outbreak investigations; 2) identify contributing factors and antecedents factors associated with foodborne illness outbreaks; 3) identify and understand environmental factors associated with sporadic foodborne illness through special studies; 4) evaluate food safety programs in Minnesota; 5) synthesize and disseminate the findings from EHS-Net research projects to the environmental health community and the food service industry; and, 6) develop, implement, and evaluate interventions at commercial food establishments that will reduce the incidence of foodborne illness. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has been a leader and active participant in EHS-Net since its inception and proposes to continue EHS-Net involvement in the same fashion going forward. Environmental health specialists from the MDH Division of Environmental Health and epidemiologists from the MDH Foodborne, Waterborne, Vector borne, and Zoonotic Diseases Section will continue to comprise the MDH EHS- Net team and will work closely together to conduct EHS-Net activities. Active population-based surveillance for reportable bacterial and protozoal pathogens will be conducted, along with state-of the art outbreak detection and investigation. Environmental assessments will be conducted on all foodborne outbreaks in commercial food establishments in Minnesota using standard tools to allow collection of high quality data for the National Voluntary Environmental Assessment Information System [NVEAIS]. Special studies to identify practices, behaviors, or other risk factors that lead to sporadic foodborne illness will be conducted at random samples of restaurants in previously selected sampling frameworks. Another proposed project is to synthesize all previous EHS-Network and disseminate it to target audiences in an effective format. Finally, a major part of our proposed ongoing work will be to use data and lessons learned from past EHS-Net activities to develop, implement, and evaluate interventions at commercial food establishments. MDH will continue to build communication and collaborations with EHS-Net partners (other states, CDC, FDA, and EPA) and will actively participate in multi-site studies decided on by the EHS-Net Steering Committee. Education of environmental health specialists and industry groups throughout Minnesota, based on lessons learned from EHS-Net, will continue to be actively pursued."
"9352922","Project Summary  The proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of an intervention to reduce exposure to medications among hospitalized older adults discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). This study will be conducted in one university-affiliated hospital and 14 area SNFs to enroll approximately 1,300 total participants across five project years. Patients discharged to SNF represent the largest segment of Medicare beneficiaries discharged to post-acute care services and are a particularly high risk group for loss of independence and other poor clinical outcomes. This investigative team recently completed a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Award, which provides strong preliminary data related to the prevalence of polypharmacy and the relationship between polypharmacy and geriatric syndromes (e.g., medications associated with falls) in this patient population. Based on these data, we developed a structured deprescribing intervention protocol (?Shed-Meds?) coupled with standardized screening assessments for eight geriatric syndromes to be implemented in the hospital and continued during the SNF stay. The goal of the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications, as defined by dose reductions and stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical criteria and patient preferences. We have pilot-tested our patient-centered intervention in preparation for this proposal with promising results. The proposed trial will evaluate the effects of this intervention on medication exposure, medication adherence, geriatric syndromes, and health status across the care transitions from hospital to SNF to home to include a 90-day follow-up period after SNF discharge. Our overarching hypothesis is that reducing medications for older patients across the continuum of care will favorably impact geriatric syndromes."
"9268114","Every year, millions of Americans present at the hospital with knee injuries, such as meniscus tears or anterior cruciate ligament (AGL) sprains. Moreover, knee injuries are one of the most common causes of missed workdays. The current paradigm of treating knee injuries initially involves frequent physical therapy visits, subjective evaluations by experts, and possibly surgery; following these initial steps the patient continues to participate in physical therapy, periodically - and typically infrequently - returns to the clinic for follow-up subjective evaluations, and bases his I her joint health rehabilitation status mainly on symptoms and pain. There is no technology available currently to provide patients with knee injuries frequent, objective, and in-depth information regarding the status of their joint rehabilitation. The hypothesis for this project is that the sounds of the joints measured using sensors embedded in a wearable wrap can provide a clinically-relevant biomarker for joint health rehabilitation assessment, and can ultimately allow patients to tune their rehabilitation exercises dynamically based on objective feedback. This could potentially accelerate rehabilitation, reduce the risk of re-injury, and empower patients to be in control of their rehabilitation. This project proposes to study these sounds, and their measurement, with an integrative program including the following specific aims: (1) Design and implement an ultra-low noise, high-bandwidth, wafer-level-packaged micro-accelerometer chip for contact measurement of joint sounds from the skin surface with high fidelity; (2) Elucidate the origin of the sounds and how they change with injury using a cadaver model; (3) Develop algorithms for extracting salient features from the joint sound signals that can be used to assess joint health; (4) Evaluate the sensors and analytics in a population of 20 subjects with meniscus tears, before and after surgery, and twice during rehabilitation several months following surgery."
"8999053","Project Summary/Abstract  The aims of the USC Norris Cancer Control Research Program are to elucidate the etiology of cancer risk  behaviors in the general population and develop primary prevention interventions that modify cancer risk  behavior and enhance secondary prevention, clinical care, and survivorship. These aims serve the overarching  goal of reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities among the populations represented in the USC  Norris catchment area, with implications for other populations globally. The Program's goals align with the USC  Norris strategic plan by: a) developing and testing new interventions that impact the cancer burden; b) applying  cutting-edge technology and methodology to assess exposures and disseminate interventions; and c)  spanning the continuum of care from primary prevention to survivorship. A hallmark of this Program has been  the application of innovative theory and methodology to develop integrated lines of research on cancer risk  behaviors and preventive interventions. Given that the diverse, vulnerable, and disadvantaged members of the  catchment area reached by the Program's work also reflect the disparities seen at the US population level and  the Program makes significant strides in addressing the mission of NCI's efforts in cancer control and  population sciences. Recent achievements of the Program, which is led by two internationally-recognized  experts, Mary Ann Pentz (primary prevention) and Anna Wu (secondary prevention and survivorship), include  1) understanding mental health comorbidities with tobacco use to inform more tailored smoking cessation  programs for vulnerable smokers who have been unable to quit by other means; 2) promoting cultural values  and decreasing perceived cultural discrimination as means to improve tobacco prevention and control efforts  with Hispanic youth and adults; and 3) utilizing executive function and mindfulness skills training in primary  prevention programs that target diet, physical inactivity, and other cancer risk behaviors in youth and applying  such interventions to cancer patients, caregivers, and families to improve treatment outcomes. The 30  members represent five schools and 13 departments at USC, and have $15M in peer-reviewed funding (direct  costs), 33% of which is from NCI, 27% from other NIH sources, and 33% from other peer-reviewed funding  sources. The Program is highly productive with 756 publications of which 17% are inter-programmatic, 23%  intra-programmatic and 53% inter-institutional."
"9103866","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT  The present research advances the science of sexual assault prevention research by rigorously evaluating two theoretically-driven, multi-session sexual assault prevention programs for high school boys with different administration approaches: (1) Your Voice Your View, developed and currently administered in Rhode Island high schools by the CDC RPE-funded agency Day One of Rhode Island; and (2) The High School Workshop, adapted from the Men's Workshop, which was previously evaluated among college men by members of this research team. Our approach to this efficacy research is not only rigorous, but also novel; exemplifying how mutually beneficial partnerships between well-established researchers and community agencies advance the science of sexual assault prevention by enhancing the capacity of community agencies to conduct rigorous program evaluations and enriching the ability of researchers to develop interventions that are sustainable outside of a laboratory setting. In the Refinement and Planning Phase, we will refine the program manuals through informant interviews, focus groups, stakeholder interviews, establishment of a Research Advisory Board, and administration of a small open pilot trial. An online survey will also be conducted to gather social norms data, and The High School Workshop will be adapted to be feasible and sustainable in a high school setting. In order to consistently administer Your Voice Your View in the context of this research design, the program will be further manualized, training manuals will be produced, and measures assessing the fidelity of program administration (i.e., adherence/competence measures) will be developed. In the Intervention Phase, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 1200 10th grade boys to demonstrate efficacy of each intervention in reducing rates of sexual aggression, dating violence involvement, and related risk/protective factors over a 6-month follow-up relative to a dose- and attention-matched General Health Promotion control group. At least six schools will be matched on demographic characteristics (i.e., % receiving subsidized lunch, racial/ethnic minority enrollment) then randomized to receive Your Voice Your View (N = 400), the High School Workshop (N = 400), or General Health Promotion (N = 400). In the Analysis and Dissemination Phase, we will conduct additional stakeholder interviews (N = 12), analyze study data, conduct cost-effectiveness analyses, prepare project reports, and share study findings with the schools as well as the local and national scientific communities. By addressing the weaknesses of both the community-based prevention program (i.e., lacking rigorous evaluation) and the research-based prevention program (i.e., lacking real-world applicability), testing both programs in comparison to a dose-and attention-matched control group, and conducting a preliminary examination of the differential efficacy of the two interventions, the results of this research will make a significant contribution to the evidence base for preventing sexual aggression among high school boys. The knowledge, infrastructure and experience provided to the community agency and research team as a result of conducting the present research will also enhance the capacities of both parties to more effectively integrate research and practice in future sexual assault prevention work."
"9164376","Project Summary/Abstract  The appearance of fatty and fibrotic infiltration in aged skeletal muscle causes a decline in muscle function and an increase in metabolic disorders. However, a means to mitigate this detrimental process remains absent, as the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to the intramuscular accumulation of these adverse atypical tissues are not well understood. Recently identified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that occupy the interstitial space of skeletal muscle (interstitial MSCs, iMSCs) have been postulated as the foremost cellular mediators of adiposis and fibrosis. In young tissue iMSCs do not covert to these fates, but instead, remain as progenitors and are assumed to support the processes of tissue homeostasis and regeneration. We hypothesize that the fate of iMSCs determine their impact on skeletal muscle and with age, iMSCs become the adipocytes and fibrocytes that negatively impact the organism as a whole. In the studies of this proposal, we will define the role of iMSCs in intramuscular fatty and fibrotic infiltration by genetically targeting the cell in vivo and examining its developmental potential in models of aged skeletal muscle (Aim 1). We will also determine the necessity of iMSCs in skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration in young and aged milieus by specifically depleting iMSCs in vivo and then examining these activities (Aim 2). Finally, we will define the molecular pathways of iMSC fate progression by modeling this process in vitro and using advanced RNA sequencing technologies to reveal non-coding and coding RNA species that can functionally modulate cell fate determination (Aim 3). Our overarching goal is to elucidate the impact iMSC fate has on skeletal muscle and to leverage these findings to develop therapeutic targets to mitigate age-related skeletal muscle decline.  The candidate, Dr. Michael Wosczyna, has extensive expertise in experimental progenitor cell biology and has spent more than a decade studying stem cell-related disorders. During the mentoring phase of this award, Dr. Wosczyna aims to advance his knowledge in age-related stem cell decline and in massively parallel technologies used for uncovering genetic pathways of fate determination. Dr. Wosczyna's mentor and co- mentor, Dr. Thomas Rando and Dr. Judith Campisi, respectively, have comprehensive expertise in these areas. They will provide an enriching environment for Dr. Wosczyna to develop as a prominent independent investigator in aging research."
"9089464","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for health care and public health knowledge about older lesbians and gay men is critical and pressing. For example, they may be ignored, dismissed, and the recipients of open discrimination in health care settings thus causing many to feel isolated, stigmatized, socially rejected, and at risk for unmet health care needs. With the  number of lesbian and gay individuals age 65 and over in the US estimated to be between 1.4 and 3.8 million, and with the figure expected to double by the year 2030, research on this socially less visible cohort is crucial. As this population ages and becomes frail, they will need increasing care in community and institutional settings, including assisted living and nursing homes. In addition, despite the increasing longevity of those with HIV infections, this issue has rarely been considered in the context of senior housing and institutional support. This is a particular gap with respect to the African-American population which not only experiences disproportionately greater rates of HIV/AIDS and lesser access to health care, but also manifests culturally significant differences in meaning attached to aging, family, use of long-term  health care resources, and social support.  The major focus of the proposed research is on residential care settings for older adults, specifically assisted living. Long-term care has been cited as an important concern for lesbian and gay older adults because of potential need due to poor health and frailty, lack of access for caregiver support systems, and fear of having to return  to the closet in their later lives out of fear of abuse, isolation, discrimination, neglect, safey, hostility, strain, and forced lack of contact with friends and families of choice. Research has emphasized the fact that these adults feel invisible and ignored, encountering increased bias with age at the time they are at most risk for institutionalization. Senior housing has been cited as a critical need, yet the framework and ideology of current senior housing has been labeled institutionalized heterosexism, with sexual and gender minorities made to fit within a heteronormative framework. In this proposal, through ethnographic interviewing, we attempt to understand the perceptions of long-term care held by gay and lesbian older adults, determine their current and projected health and care needs related to assisted living, and explore how assisted living settings can best meet their needs and wants.  In this 24-month research project, we propose to conduct ethnographic interviews with 60 lesbian and gay informants age 65 and over (15 European-American lesbians, 15 African- American lesbians, 15 European- American gay men, and 15 African-American gay men) about these topics for a total of 60 interviews. Because of the sexual minority status of this population, participants will be drawn in part from community organizations and other institutions identified as lesbian and gay friendly or pro-diversity as well as from purposive sampling. Standard methods of qualitative data analysis will be used."
"9165436","Project Summary  When we fall asleep, the world around us doesn't stop producing stimuli. Preparing for sleep, most animals seek out a secluded spot that not only protects them from predators, but also helps filter out some of the sensory information that is constantly bombarding our senses. In addition to this behavioral filtering, the brain itself filters information during sleep. We propose that by studying how sensory information is gated during sleep, we can gain insight into how sensory awareness is generated in the brain. We are establishing novel experimental platforms that exploit the dynamic arousal threshold during sleep in Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful model for the genetic dissection of nervous system function. We will look for genes and neurons that gate sensory information during sleep.  Sleep in Drosophila displays many characteristics of mammalian sleep, and known sleep factors are conserved between flies and us. We will use the fly to understand another puzzle that interests us - how animals regulate their sleep amount. We are all familiar with the drowsy feeling that results from inadequate sleep, when all we want to do is crawl back to bed. The need for sleep can be overwhelming, and this is due to the essential nature of this behavior. But what is this feeling, where does it come from? Despite longstanding interest in this question, we do not have any mechanistic insights into how sleep homeostasis ? the physiological balance between waking and sleep - is regulated. Using the same system we designed to probe arousal threshold, we can deprive flies of sleep in a high-throughput and automated manner, and look for animals whose rebound sleep deviates from normal. Our approach is particularly innovative in using the same system to study two distinct but essential biological questions. Finding animals that do not sense the loss of sleep, or cannot respond adequately, will afford an opportunity to study molecular and neural correlates of sleep homeostasis. This is of great relevance for human health, as sleep disturbances underlie many significant health problems including depression, diabetes and cancer."

"9165246","Abstract  Non-genetic information has recently been shown to regulate an increasing number of complex phenotypes, including physical appearance, energy metabolism, behavioral state, and longevity. How epigenetic information is transmitted from generation to generation is still largely unknown. Anything in the zygote, which is not the DNA itself, could carry this non-genetic information. Here we propose taking advantage of the nematode C. elegans, where we have characterized several examples of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, to identify the heritable material that regulates epigenetic memory. We have identified that C. elegans contain an ancient form of DNA methylation, on the 6th position of the purine ring in adenines (6mA), which was previously thought to only occur in unicellular organisms. We were the first to identify this methylation in Metazoa and additionally found that this modification increases progressively in a paradigm of epigenetic memory. Here we propose to characterize this novel epigenetic modification in eukaryotes by identifying in which specific tissues and genomic locations 6mA modifications occur. We will also identify and characterize the enzymes that add, remove and recognize this modification. Finally we will combine metabolic methyl-labeling and directed methylation and demethylation to determine whether 6mA is the heritable material. Together this application will define a fundamental new layer of conserved epigenetic regulation and begin to identify whether 6mA can transmit a molecular memory across generations."

"9149023","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are a common cause of illness globally and it is estimated to be the third common cause of death, approximately 7% of all deaths in 2004. In Ghana, where infectious diseases including respiratory infections, constitute more than 40% of all deaths in the country, there is little or n data on the epidemiology of ALRI and almost all febrile episodes are treated as malaria. Knowledge of the epidemiology, treatment and prevention of respiratory infections will assist in producing reliable estimates of the burden of ALRI to inform the preparation of national preparedness plans against influenza epidemics. At the core of these studies will be; i) a health facility based prospective surveillance of severe influenza; ii) a cohort of pregnant women and their infants and iii) a cohort of young children to estimate the burden of severe disease in these two groups of persons as a baseline for future vaccine trials. We will use these studies to document among other things the hospitalization rate of severe influenza, the burden of influenza and risk factors for severe influenza in the population, pregnant women and young children as well as evaluate case definitions for influenza and other respiratory pathogens in the DWD. In addition we will characterize influenza and other respiratory pathogens in patients with co-morbid and chronic conditions such as malaria, HIV/AIDs, Tuberculosis and Diabetes. We will also conduct studies on the immune response to influenza virus infection in the population. The studies will be initiated in the Dangme West District, one of the DSS sites in the country, and subsequently transition to the two other demographic surveillance sites in Kintampo and Navrongo in the middle belt and the northern guinea savannah respectively. We hope to obtain comprehensive data on the epidemiology, treatment and prevention of influenza and other respiratory infections in Ghana, including the hospitalization rate of severe influenza, the burden of influenza and risk factors for severe influenza. We will also obtain data to evaluate case definitions for influenza and other respiratory pathogens in the Dodowa district and characterize influenza and other respiratory pathogens in patients with co- morbid and chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDs, Tuberculosis and Diabetes.

"9126268","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks support for the UMass Worcester Prevention Research Center (UMW-PRC), initially funded by the CDC in 2009 as a developmental PRC. Funding will support the growth and enhancement of a comprehensive core infrastructure that fosters applied public health research partnerships with state and local departments of public health and numerous community partners. Our faculty conduct intervention research, implementation research and public health practice-based research that targets the CDC Winnable Battles of nutrition, physical activity and obesity in the Worcester, MA area. The UMW-PRC has six priority areas: racial and ethnic health disparities, the built environment and systems, comorbid obesity and mental health, child and adolescent health, worksite health promotion, and community-clinical linkages. In the proposed funding cycle, the UMW-PRC will further its role as 1) an institutional leader in applied public health research, 2) an integral part of the collaborative public health system within Worcester, MA, 3) a statewide resource for applied public health research expertise, and 4) a national model for bidirectional applied public health research that integrates academic medicine, public health, health care and communities. This will be accomplished through innovations in each of the PRC programmatic components: administration and infrastructure, community engagement and technical assistance, communication and dissemination, training, and evaluation. Building from this infrastructure, our proposed applied public health prevention research project will be implemented in the racial/ethnically diverse Union Hill neighborhood, which the City of Worcester has prioritized for revitalization due to its high rates of crime, poverty and unemployment, deteriorating built environment, and high chronic disease burden. Targeted resource investments aim to improve crime and safety and economic development. Simultaneously, Union Hill will be targeted by a Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) Mass in Motion/Community Transformation Grant (MiM- CTG) to implement public policy and environmental improvements to promote physical activity and healthy eating and reduce obesity. Perceived social norms, limited parental efficacy to influence child obesogenic behaviors and limited parenting skills related to child obesogenic behaviors may reduce the impact of built environment interventions. The proposed study will test the impact of the built environment intervention plus a family-focused community health worker (CHW)-delivered component to improve ability of families to navigate their environment and promote healthy eating and activity through improvements in social norms, parental efficacy, and parenting skills, compared to the built environment intervention plus an attention control CHW- delivered component. The study uses a quasi-experimental design to assess impact on child and parent diet, physical activity and BMI. We will use MDPH statewide child BMI data to compare impact of the combined built environment interventions in Union Hill to the MiM-CTG program only in comparable MA urban communities."
"9240155","Aging is associated with a decrease in movement and cognition, and understanding the neurophysiological bases of these behavioral deficits will be key to increasing healthspan. Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra are key central mediators of voluntary movement and reward-related behavior, and the function of these neurons is known to decline with age. Unfortunately, little is currently known about how normal aging affects the specific intrinsic channels and synaptic inputs that are responsible for dopamine neuron excitability and function. Our lab has developed reliable methodology for making electrophysiological recordings of dopamine neurons in brain slices from mice of advanced age, thus a comprehensive investigation into the effects of aging on ion channel physiology in these neurons is now possible. We will combine electrophysiology, behavior, gene expression analysis, and optogenetics to elucidate the effects of aging on ion channel signaling and dopamine-mediated behaviors. Furthermore, we will use dietary restriction (an established healthspan- increasing intervention) to identify the ionic mechanisms that counteract age-related deficits in behavior. Our central hypothesis is that age-related deficits in movement and reward-related behaviors can be attributed to specific ion channel conductances in substantia nigra dopamine neurons, and that these deficits can be attenuated by dietary restriction. Aim 1 is to determine the relationship between age-related deficits in specific ion channel currents and cell firing. We will also relate (in individual mice) our electrophysiological findings in single neurons to previously obtained locomotor behavioral data. Aim 2 is to determine the effects of aging on excitatory inputs from the hypothalamus to dopamine neurons as well as reward-related behavior. For this aim we will employ optogenetics to study identified glutamate inputs in a brain region-specific manner. Aim 3 is to determine the effects of aging on dopamine autoreceptor-mediated neurotransmission. Aim 4 is to determine the effects of dietary restriction in aging mice as an intervention that can counteract age-related decline of ion conductances in dopamine neurons and related behaviors. These studies will provide the first detailed understanding of the relationship between aging, dopamine neuron activity, and dopamine-mediated behaviors, and determine the protective effects of dietary restriction on these parameters."
"9159871","Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic, debilitating, potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder that causes irreversible damage to the lacrimal and salivary glands resulting in a loss of tear and saliva production, severely impairing quality of life. SS affects an estimated 2 to 4 million Americans, with as many as 50% of individuals with SS remaining undiagnosed and delays of diagnosis of up to 7 years from the initial onset of symptoms. Early diagnosis of SS is critical to enable early treatment and surveillance for serious complications such as lymphoma. Dry eye disease, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), is highly prevalent in the general population and is one of the key features of SS, preceding the systemic findings of SS by an average of 10 years. Approximately 11% of dry eye patients presenting to an eye care professional have underlying SS. However, because the diagnostic work-up for SS involves collaboration among multiple specialists, is time-consuming and expensive, it is not feasible to work-up all KCS patients for SS. Because SS patients often first seek care for dry eye, ophthalmologists have a unique opportunity to screen patients for SS but are severely hampered by a lack of evidence-based, accurate screening tools. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a new clinical prediction model for detecting SS, and to increase our understanding of the important relationship between KCS and SS. We propose to leverage clinical data and biospecimens from the National Institute of Health (NIH)-sponsored Sjogren's International Clinical Collaborative Alliance (SICCA) study, in order to gain deeper insight into the characteristics of different subgroups of KCS patients with or without SS. Our overall hypothesis is that the SICCA data and biospecimens can be used to develop an effective screening tool for dry eye patients to distinguish patients with KCS-only from those with SS. Moreover, we hypothesize that the assessment of novel serum antibodies [SP-1 (salivary gland protein-1), CA-6 (carbonic anhydrase-6), and PSP (parotid secretory protein)] will improve the accuracy of the tool (9). We will evaluate these hypotheses with 3 specific aims:  Aim 1: Determine if novel candidate SS antibody status distinguishes KCS subjects without SS from  those with SS, and predicts conversion of KCS patients to SS;  Aim 2: Develop a clinical prediction model using symptoms (extra-ocular and ocular), ocular signs, and  novel antibody status for distinguishing KCS patients without SS from those with SS;  Aim 3: Validate the clinical prediction model in a new cohort of KCS patients. We anticipate that our new screening tool will shift the current clinical paradigm by allowing ophthalmologists to efficiently identify and refer dry eye patients with a high likelihood of having SS. We will also establish a new dry eye cohort and biospecimen bank for future studies. Our overall goal is to reduce the long delays in the diagnosis of SS that lead to delayed treatment and inadequate surveillance for serious complications."

"9151630","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The formation of the mammalian neocortex is a complicated process requiring the coordination of neurogenesis and the migration postmitotic neuronal precursors. The radial glia stem cells undergoing neurogenesis oscillate their nuclei in synchrony with cell cycle progression in a process known as interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). After this, progeny migrate along the basal processes of the radial glia to their final location in the cerebral cortex. The major microtubule minus-end directed motor protein dynein has been shown to be crucial for both of these processes INM and postmitotic migration, particularly for movement of the nucleus.  Dynein depends on a variety of adaptor proteins to enhance its functionality, and recent work from our lab has shown the investigated the unique and overlapping roles of the paralog proteins NudE and NudEL (arising from the NDE1 and NDEL1 genes respectively). Both proteins are known to undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications, and phosphorylations of the proteins are known to greatly impact their function. Importantly our lab has shown that Cdk1 phosphorylation of proteins in radial glia control apical INM, and NudE is a known substrate of Cdk1. Additionally, mutations in the human NDE1 gene have been linked to severe forms of microcephaly as well as multiple cases of schizophrenia. It is fascinating that these two diseases, which are on opposing ends of the clinical spectrum in many aspects, can arise from mutations in different regions of the same protein.  The goals of this project are to: determine the effects of phosphorylation site mutations and microcephaly-causing NDE1 mutations on radial glia function in the developing rat neocortex (Aim 1), and investigate the role of NudE and NudEL during the postmitotic precursors and the effect of the schizophrenia-causing mutations of NDE1 on postmitotic neuronal migration. Using in utero electroporation of NudE with a variety of site-directed mutations to impair phosphorylation or mimic the human mutations, further insight can be gained into the pathophysiology of microcephaly and schizophrenia during neocortical development."
"9142060","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor eating habits, sedentary behavior, and deficient sleep quality are problematic for many college students. Surrounded by numerous unhealthy food choices and physical activity barriers, students are vulnerable to overweight and chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Today's college students are more technologically connected than previous generations positioning mobile devices as an ideal method for reaching this population with healthy lifestyle information. In a Phase I SBIR, our team developed Healthy Detours, an innovative mobile phone application (app) designed to assist college students make healthier choices about food and physical activity on and around their college campus. Specifically, we (a) developed a comprehensive database to provide user-specific information through the use of location-based services (LBS) focused on healthy lifestyle choices; (b) conducted an online survey with a national sample of undergraduates which examined eating and physical activity preferences, interest in smartphone technology to monitor healthy lifestyle choices, and use of check-ins for health information; (c) conducted focus groups which demonstrated the prototype app's ability to provide the user with rudimentary aspects of the LBS database to facilitate real- time decision making for healthier choices; (d) conducted lab and field usability testing of the app for its accuracy in identifying user location and functionality; and (e) developed a specifications document to outline the Phase II development plan. The results of the Phase I activities provided strong support for this Phase II SBIR application in which we propose to develop an interactive, mobile app that is guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). The proposed Phase II project will produce a fully functional LBS smartphone app that will provide (1) immediate and relevant feedback at the point of decision- making to reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors, (2) person- and location-specific tailored data, acquired through activity tracking, to provide users with necessary information to improve future decision-making, and (3) multiple health-tracking features that will aid in self-monitoring. Healthy Detours will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (n=300) with students at a large 4-year university. Primary outcomes include changes in dietary intake, physical activity behavior, sleep quality, and quality of life. Overall, the proposed project has the potential to significantly impact colleg students' health and quality of life by providing them with real-time healthy choices. Healthy Detours is one of the first comprehensive wellness apps offered to college students, and provides an opportunity via the SBIR funding mechanism to reach a large number of students as evidenced by our commercialization plan."

"9073484","Project 2  Project Summary Abstract  The implication of extracellular membrane vesicles such as exosomes, and membrane protrusions such as  tunneling nanotubes, in intercellular trafficking networks opens a new perspective in understanding tumor  development and progression. The ubiquitin system is one of the central regulators of biogenesis and function  of exosomes and nanotubes, and infection with tumor viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) results in  deregulation of cellular functions by manipulation of this system during cell transformation. Studies in recent  years clearly demonstrate that the spectrum of potential functions of the small evolutionarily conserved family  of Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolases (UCHs) is much wider than was suspected. Among them, UCH-l1 is of  special interest: recent studies including ours demonstrate that this unique deubiquitinase is closely involved  not only in cell transformation and in primary tumor formation, but is a main regulator of cancer progression as  well. Based directly on our previous studies and substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that UCH-L1 is a  major regulator of ubiquitin-dependent processes of intra- and inter-cellular trafficking in EBV-positive cancers.  In Aim I, we will analyze how distinct biochemical functions of UCH-L1 are required for exosome biogenesis  and sorting, and how the EBV major oncogene, Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1), is involved in these  processes. In Aim II, based on our recent discovery that N-cadherin is highly expressed in EBV-driven B-cell  lymphomas, and co-localizes with UCH-L1 in these cells, we will explore the role of N-cadherin-based  complexes in intercellular trafficking of pro-metastatic factors produced by EBV-positive cancer cells. The  results in this Aim will clarify how tunneling nanotubes and exosomes produced by EBV-transformed cells  change the tumor microenvironment by transferring pro-invasive factors to tumor stromal tissues. In Aim III we  will investigate whether inhibition of UCH-L1 activity with specific small-molecule inhibitors that have anti-  tumorigenic effects in cell culture will also be active in vivo against EBV B-cell lymphogenesis in humanized  mice. We will determine whether UCH-L1 DUB activity is required for EBV-induced immortalization of normal  human B-cells, and whether inhibition of UCH-L1 affects expression and function of EBV genes in latently  infected cells as well as during viral reactivation. EBV is tightly linked to several highly invasive malignancies of  lymphoid and epithelial origin; treatment of patients with these malignancies poses unique challenges, and  outcomes remain poor. Since recent study has demonstrated a profound anti-metastatic effect of such UCH-L1  inhibitor in a mouse model of invasive carcinoma, specific inhibitors of UCH-L1 enzymatic activity may offer an  adjunct to existing therapies."
"9085647","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Einstein Aging Study (EAS) has long focused on the risk factors and cognitive changes that predict the subsequent onset of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Traditional diagnostic approaches measure cognition on single occasions. Yet, cognitive performance may vary within individuals over hours or days, resulting in single shot assessments that are influenced by unmeasured sources of within-person variability. The limited reliability, precision and ecological validity of standard assessment approaches impedes the sensitive measurement of cognitive status and change, delaying the detection of the earliest cognitive impairment in preclinical AD. The overall goal of this competing renewal is to use ambulatory methods to improve the detection and definition of the cognitive states associated with preclinical AD and to better characterize the role of novel and remediable risk factors on the preclinical onset of AD. The EAS will address these problems by leveraging recent innovations in the use of ambulatory methods. Our team has developed ambulatory methods that use mobile technology (e.g., smartphones) to assess both objective and subjective cognitive function, behavior, and psychological states in real-time and in people's naturalistic settings. The EAS has long been a community-based study; with this new proposal, we move from bringing the community into our clinic to bringing our clinic-developed measures directly to the community. We will combine these novel ambulatory cognitive measures with the team's expertise in assessing vascular function and risk factors, as well as pain and stress as they relate to cognitive health. By integrating ambulatory measurement of cognitive function (Project 3), stress and pain (Project 1) and autonomic function (Project 2), we will be able to elucidate the biological, behavioral and psychological processes that impact daily cognitive function and long-term cognitive decline. We are enthusiastic to explore the use of ambulatory assessments acquired in an individual's natural environment to improve the ecological validity of cognitive research by enhancing researchers' ability to study cognitive function and pre-clinical AD in older adults. This work will lead to a better understanding of cognitive aging and dementia and ultimately set the stage for intervention studies."

"9219985","Abstract Human caliciviruses are now the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in children following introduction of rotavirus vaccines. While a great deal of data are emerging on the epidemiology and immunology of norovirus, a well-known calicivirus, similar data do not exist for sapovirus, a largely unknown and unstudied calicivirus. Importantly, sapovirus is gaining recognition as an important gastrointestinal pathogen in children. Data from recently published studies indicate sapovirus prevalence can range as high as 12 to 24% in children under five years of age with gastroenteritis. Furthermore, a recent re-analysis of the multi-site MAL-ED cohort samples found that sapovirus had the highest attributable fraction for diarrhea among all enteropathogens in infants. Given the importance of sapovirus among children with gastroenteritis, data are urgently needed to guide control and prevention strategies. For this proposal, we will investigate the natural history, development of immunity, and transmission dynamics of sapovirus in a cohort of 400 Nicaraguan children followed from birth until three years of age. Extensive questionnaire data, biological specimens (i.e., stool, serum, saliva, and breast milk), geographic coordinates, and environmental samples will be collected at baseline and regularly (weekly or monthly) during 36 months of follow-up. Because human sapovirus strains are unculturable, our team will also develop new virus-like particles (VLPs) for common sapovirus genotypes in order to measure anti-sapovirus IgA and IgG antibody concentrations in collected samples. In addition, cutting-edge laboratory techniques will be used in combination with epidemiologic data to investigate the course of sapovirus infections among children in the cohort, their households, and their communities. Nicaragua provides an ideal site to execute this study of the natural history, immunology, and transmission dynamics of sapovirus, because of the high incidence of sapovirus gastroenteritis in children under 5 years, the robust research infrastructure at the proposed site, and a long- standing collaboration between the University of North Carolina (UNC) and the University of Nicaragua (UNAN). In addition to leveraging this pre-existing collaboration, we have joined with calicivirus expert, Dr. Jan Vinjé, who will provide content expertise for the study and will carry out some of the laboratory analyses in his lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We are also forming a new collaboration with NIH-funded investigators who are conducting a parallel research study of childhood viral gastroenteritis in Peru, where the incidence of norovirus, but not sapovirus, is high. Together, this unique collaboration affords us the ability to exchange research and analytic tools to better understand the epidemiology and immunology of viral gastroenteric pathogens in young children. Specifically, this new research proposal will generate novel data that are fundamental for the advancement of control and prevention interventions, including future sapovirus vaccine development."

"9356899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, there is a renewed commitment to eliminate mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. In Malawi, universal, lifelong combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) is recommended for all HIV-infected women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or between pregnancies. In this approach, known as Option B+, combination ART is prescribed irrespective of a woman's immune status or stage of HIV clinical disease. Findings from a recent, large multisite randomized clinical trial known as PROMISE showed that combination ART can reduce rates of MTCT of HIV to very low levels (~0.5%). The efficacy results of the PROMISE trial support the 2013 WHO guidelines where use of combination ART was recommended. The PROMISE study also showed that some ART drugs may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight (LBW) and preterm (PT) birth and may increase early neonatal death. While PROMISE did not randomize women to Malawi's specific Option B+ regimen, some drugs are common to both regimens.  We propose an observational study with two specific aims that relate to safety findings from PROMISE. In Aim 1, we will compare pregnancy outcomes (LBW, PT and intrauterine growth restriction) between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women. Aim 2 will compare survival between HIV-exposed infants (born to HIV-infected mothers) and HIV-unexposed infants (born to HIV-uninfected mothers). Earlier studies that predated ART use in Africa showed substantial differences in pregnancy outcomes and infant survival among HIV-infected untreated women and their children compared to HIV-uninfected women and their children. These differences were attributed to HIV. The goal of the proposed study is to assess if universal ART, as in Option B+, has eliminated these differences. This is an urgent and important question. If substantial differences in pregnancy outcomes and survival associated with HIV still remain, other factors underlying these outcomes will need further examination. The proposed study is exploratory and will provide preliminary data to conceptualize larger studies to examine the complex causes of these outcomes - including safety of ARTs - and to determine if further interventions are needed.  The study will be conducted in Blantyre, Malawi in the main hospital and several health centers. A total sample of 1350 women will be enrolled; 675 HIV-infected healthy women on Option B+ ART prior to or during pregnancy and 675 HIV-uninfected women. These women and their children will be prospectively followed postnatally for up to one year. Birth weight and gestational age will be assessed at birth and case reports forms will be completed at enrollment and each follow-up visit."

"9167987","CRISPR-based Modular Therapy for Precision Medicine 3 CTR 6 MCB Project Summary Efforts to treat genetic diseases have suffered from insufficiently transformative clinical technologies. The recent development of CRISPR genome editing tools is paving the way for new innovations in precision medicine. In 2013, we spearheaded the first successful correction of an inherited liver disease mutation in an adult mammal using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. However, in vivo delivery of CRISPR components for disease treatment remains a challenge as we strive to reduce off target effects, provide transient editing systems and increase the rates of gene correction. In this application, we propose to develop an innovative modular delivery strategy to help address these issues. Our programmable modular approach will allow us target a large number of genetic mutations in mouse models of human disease. The modules comprise: (1) Cas9, (2) single-guide RNA (sgRNA), and (3) a DNA repair template. By breaking CRISPR into smaller components, we can use both adeno-associated virus (AAV) and non-viral vehicles to achieve transient therapeutic delivery to various organs. This new method will advance precision medicine research for an array of genetic diseases. Specifically, we will develop a Cas9 module using lipid nanoparticle delivery of Cas9 mRNA and AAV delivery of self-targeting Cas9 in order to improve the precision of genome editing. We will fine-tune DNA repair pathways in vivo to increase the rate of gene correction and explore whether inhibiting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) can promote homology-directed repair (HDR) in non- dividing somatic cells such as pancreatic cells and neurons. We will also develop platforms for CRISPR-based modular therapy for a panel of genetic disease, especially those which require a high rate of gene correction such as alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. These investigations will form the basis of a clinically-relevant platform capable of precisely targeting a wide range of disease gene mutations in somatic organs."
"9136256","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin resistance (IR), also known as metabolic syndrome, is tied to obesity and is associated with numerous modern health problems including the growing problems of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The growing health, economic and social burdens of these conditions calls for the need to develop drug treatments for IR. We know from multiple lines of evidence that mtDNA serves as a molecular sentinel, controlling cell fate in response to oxidant stress. There is a conspicuous association between mtDNA damage and oxidant induced cell death (the propensity for cytotoxicity is inversely related to the efficiency of mtDNA repair). Also, a growing body of evidence suggests that integrity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is crucial in the IR progression. The mtDNA is highly specialized and encodes for proteins essential for energy metabolism and free radical production, very critical for insulin signaling. With respect to IR, we have found that the extent f mtDNA damage directly correlates to obesity-induced IR. Using a genetic approach, the targeting of Exscien's fusion protein construct Exscien1-I to mitochondria (containing the DNA repair enzyme human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, hOGG1) has shown to significantly improve insulin sensitivity in transgenic MTS-hOGG1 mice. Essentially, by overexpressing the repair enzyme at the point of oxidative stress we have attenuated the level of mtDNA damage and the IR side effects. We now propose to fully verify the level of efficacy of mitochondria-targeted DNA repair drugs in the obesity-induced mouse model of IR. The intent of this Phase I proposal is to establish proof-of-concept that pharmacologic enhancement of mtDNA repair attenuates the degree of IR. This proposed application is innovative because it will herald first-in-class, molecules directed against a novel target in metabolic syndrome, mtDNA."

Core C is based on the Cancer Center  Support Grant (CCSG) core infrastructure and all Core C personnel are part of the UTSW CCSG grant. Core  C members (biostatisticians, bioinformaticians, database specialists) play integrated roles in all SPORE  projects, the DRP, and CEP. Each SPORE project is supported by two designated Core C members ensuring  statistical rigor for all research design and data analysis. The project-designated Core C members are further  assisted by other Core C members with consideration given to bioinformatics and database requirements.  Integration of Core C biostatisticians into SPORE projects has maximized biostatistical expertise on the  SPORE research, providing opportunities for our biostatisticians to contribute each step along the research  process, from preliminary data analysis to hypothesis formulation to study design. In addition to the following  four specific aims, Core C also has the capability and research plan for new biostatistics and bioinformatics  method development that will directly enhance SPORE projects, as well as DRP and CEP projects. Aim 1  (Biostatistics). To provide state-of-the-art statistical design and analysis plans required to address the specific  aims of translational and basic science research projects, and clinical trial protocols. Aim 2 (Biostatistics). To  perform proper, innovative statistical analysis for all SPORE Projects. To ensure that the results of all Projects  are based on well-designed experiments, appropriately interpreted, and to assist in the preparation of  manuscripts describing these results. Aim 3 (Bioinformatics). To ensure that all high-throughput experiments  (genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) are well designed and the data are properly processed with adequate  quality control, and properly analyzed using valid and innovative bioinformatics methods. Aim 4 (Database).  To develop and maintain a web-accessible site for data integration and storage linked to an extensive live  tissue repository of frozen samples, tumorgrafts and cell lines to support SPORE investigators and, more  broadly, the research community."
"9353042","Project 1 explores the transition from asymptomatic, preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) to symptomatic AD by incorporating the novel tau imaging tracer, T807 F18 (AV1451), into the biomarker-rich protocol of the Adult Children Study (ACS) to identify the temporal onset of neocortical involvement by tau and to quantify tau density and distribution. Project 1 findings will be correlated with other indicators of preclinical AD obtained in all Projects and relevant Cores of this application as described in the Specific Aims below. 1. Assess cerebral tau distribution and burden in the ACS, at baseline and longitudinally every three years thereafter, with T807 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. a. Compare tau burden cross-sectionally in cognitively normal participants and those with symptomatic AD. b. Correlate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and p-tau181 (Biomarker Core, Project 2) with T807 to test the hypothesis: tauopathy-related neural injury predicts the transition from preclinical to symptomatic AD. c. Similarly, correlate the spatial distribution of tauopathy to test the hypothesis: the spread of tauopathy from the transentorhinal region to the neocortex predicts the transition from preclinical to symptomatic AD. 2. Correlate cross-sectional and longitudinal T807 imaging: a. With amyloid PET imaging (Project 4) to test the hypothesis that cerebral amyloidosis and tauopathy each are necessary to predict the transition to symptomatic AD. b. With CSF concentrations of tau, p-tau181, VILIP-1, SNAP-25, and Neurogranin (Biomarker Core, Project 2), as markers of synaptic and neural injury, and with CSF A?42 and YKL-40. c. With imaging measures of hippocampal atrophy, reduced cortical thickness, and disrupted resting state networks (Project 4) as markers of neural injury 3. Identify inflection points (changepoints) on composite measures of episodic memory (Clinical Core), attentional control (Project 3), and global cognitive performance (Clinical Core) that indicate the cognitive decline heralding the onset of symptomatic AD."
"9103796","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quality report cards are intended to inform consumers, increase the demand elasticity for quality, enhance competition and as a result lead to quality improvement. Evidence to-date suggests that some report cards, such as the CMS Nursing Home Compare (NHC), may fall short on reaching these objectives because of the complexity of the information they provide. NHC includes information about staffing, deficiency citation and 18 Quality Measures (QMs). This large amount of information presents a challenge to consumers when choosing a nursing home. Individuals have been shown in prior studies to be able to make better choices when they have summary measures that integrate the multiple dimensions of quality and simplify their decision process.  Recognizing this need, and in response to a request from Congress, CMS introduced the 5 Star system in 2008. It offers summary measures along 4 dimensions: 1) an overall rating; 2) ratings based on QMs; 3) ratings based on staffing; 4) ratings based on deficiencies. The relative weights of each component in the summary measures reflect the preferences and recommendations made by an expert panel convened by CMS.  This proposal is motivated by the recognition that an expert panel may not be representative of the average nursing home resident or family members, who are the actual decision makers. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to elicit preferences of individuals with recent nursing home admission experience and use those preferences to develop and test alternative, consumer-driven, 5 Star systems.  To achieve this objective a survey will be administered to a large national sample of respondents with recent nursing home admission experience. The survey will elicit preferences with respect to nursing home quality, utilizing hedonic pricing and contingent valuation techniques. It will also gather information about socio-demographic, economic and health status to allow tests of hypotheses regarding the dependence of preferences on these factors. This information, in conjunction with quality measures calculated from the MDS and OSCAR files, will be used to develop two alternative composite ranking systems. The rankings based on hedonic pricing and contingent valuations would be compared to each other and to the 5 Star, expert panel based rankings.  This project will offer information that could guide future improvements to the 5 Star system, as  called for by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). Furthermore, it is responsive to the priorities included in the National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Health Care, which emphasizes patient and family preferences as guiding patient centered care."
"9192984","Project Summary/Abstract Endometriosis is a common disease causing pelvic pain and infertility. It affects the quality of life of millions of women and has a major impact on the U.S. health economy. Most disease derives from retrograde menstrual seeding of endometrial tissue and cells from the lining of the uterus (eutopic endometrium) onto pelvic structures that develop as lesions and elicit an inflammatory response and scarring. It is surgically diagnosed, is heterogeneous in appearance and staging and is characterized by unpredictable responses to surgical and medical therapies. Abnormalities within the uterus predisposing to establishing the disease are either inherent (genetic) or acquired (environmental/lifestyle), and if the latter, raise the possibility of life-style modification to alter disease risk and progression. The NIH Human Genome Project and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project are generating genomic and epigenomic data, and with powerful bioinformatics and biostatistical tools, are providing novel insights into multiple diseases. However, no studies have utilized these combined technologies at the scale required to address fundamental questions related to endometriosis - a scientific gap addressed herein. A growing number of human diseases are associated with acquired defects in DNA methylation, and epigenetic changes provide a biological link between individual exposures and phenotype. Our proposal addresses identifying endometriosis-specific, eutopic endometrial DNA methylation signals, their associations with surgical disease phenotypes and specific patient characteristics, genetic and non-genetic contributions to these DNA methylation signals and potentially identifying modifiable disease risk factors. Our team involves a collaboration among global leading genomic and epidemiological research centers focused on endometriosis (UCSF, Harvard, Oxford, QIMR, and University of Melbourne (the ?Consortium?)) to address the hypotheses that 1) environmental and genetic influences contribute to endometriosis and leave long-term signatures in the DNA methylome in the eutopic endometrium that contribute to disease pathogenesis and pathophysiology; and 2) these can serve to stratify disease risk and inform new avenues for drug target discoveries and diagnostic development. We propose to perform genome-wide DNA methylation analyses and genotyping of nearly 1000 well annotated, existing eutopic endometrium samples (and ongoing accrual for a 400 sample replication study), collected by standard operating procedures and extensive phenotyping, established by our World Endometriosis Research Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonization Project (WERF-EPHect)."
"9214981","PROJECT SUMMARY Plasmodium infections and the disease malaria remain global health emergencies. Malaria affected more than 200 million people last year, killing nearly 600,000. Antibody responses that target the parasite are essential for controlling parasite replication and limiting the severity of malaria. Potent antibody responses and optimally stimulated B cells require `help' from CD4+ T cells. Our published work has shown that CD4+ T cell function is markedly impaired following Plasmodium infection. We linked the reduced function of CD4+ T cells to the induction of co-inhibitory receptor expression, a class of T cell surface expressed proteins that directly limit the ability of CD4+ T cells to orchestrate protective immune responses against microbial pathogens. We further showed that blocking the activity of co-inhibitory receptors during malaria restored CD4+ T cell function, promoted strong antibody responses and accelerated parasite control and clearance from the infected host.  Recently, we identified that we can also restore the function of Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells by activating OX40, a member of a class of T cell stimulating receptors. Our new data show that therapeutically stimulating the OX40 receptor during the second week of experimental Plasmodium infection overcomes co- inhibitory networks, markedly improves CD4+ T cell activity and secreted antibody responses, and limits malaria parasite replication. Importantly, we also identified parallels in children infected with P. falciparum, establishing the relevance and significance of our discoveries and strengthening the scientific premise of the current proposal. In this project we apply new cellular, genetic and parasitological reagents to study how the OX40 receptor regulates communication between parasite specific CD4+ T cells and B cells and the generation of antibody responses. Our scientific questions and experimental approaches facilitate our long- term goal to identify new immune-based approaches to therapeutically stimulate host resistance against malaria. Our goal is addressed by three specific aims that will determine: 1) the distinct characteristics of Plasmodium infection that uniquely regulate the functional expression of OX40 receptors on CD4+ T cells; 2) whether the OX40 receptor is required for effective communication between CD4+ T cells and B cells to generate potent antibody responses; and 3) whether B cell expression of the OX40 ligand is regulated by parasite byproducts and necessary for generating potent secreted antibody responses. Our proposed studies and new reagents provide tractable systems and a detailed framework for sustainable extensions of this project that will establish additional new paradigms for enhancing CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity against Plasmodium. Insight gained during the course of our studies will help us identify and develop new immune- based strategies to limit Plasmodium disease burden."
"9309413","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia (lazy eye) and strabismus (misaligned eyes) are medical eye conditions that combine as the leading causes of preventable vision loss in children. They are irreversible if not detected and corrected by the age of seven, however half of all cases are missed because the conditions do not always manifest themselves and pediatricians are unable to reliably detect the conditions. The current health care system badly needs an accurate and effective approach toward detecting amblyopia and strabismus in preschool children, and this application aims to show that REBIScan's Pediatric Vision Scanner is capable of detecting disease, including the most difficult for providers to diagnose, with a hig level of accuracy within a primary clinic with lay users as screeners.  The study will be conducted in busy, ethnically and racially diverse primary care sites operated by the Kaiser Permanente system, with outcomes and efficiency of testing compared to the current standard of care.  The research proposed in this SBIR application will complete the last significant milestones necessary for commercialization of the PVS. While the technology has been tested in enriched populations, there are no studies that test device performance when lay users perform testing in a busy pediatric setting, and usability has not been tested in the primary care setting.  The Specific Aims will advance the health outcomes of children by using a scientifically rigorous approach to provide the efficiency and accuracy data that clinicians, investors, and payors require before the PVS can be adopted commercially. A two-phase study has been designed to compare the Pediatric Vision Scanner to the standard of care today. The first phase includes a sample population of older children in whom a limited Gold Standard Examination (visual acuity testing and non-cycloplegic autorefraction) is easily performed by a non-specialist in the primary care clinic. A linkage study will then be performed on a larger group of younger children who will receive the complete Gold Standard Examination.  If the results of this study are similar to published studies performed with enriched populations, then the NIH will have funded a technology that has the potential to change the world and the way it detects amblyopia and strabismus."
"9072014","SUMMARY  This project is designed to test a novel hypothesis that cancer cells communicate with the host via C5a/C5aR-  induced systemic SK1/S1P, which then promotes tumor metastasis, and that inhibition of systemic S1P/C5aR  signaling suppresses metastasis. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1 is designed  to define the roles and mechanisms of cancer cell-induced vascular endothelial cell complement signaling and  systemic SK1/S1P in the regulation of tumor metastasis. Aim 2 is designed to determine the down-stream  mechanisms by which cancer cell-induced systemic SK-1/S1P promotes tumor metastasis. In this Aim, our  main goal is to test our hypothesis that cancer cell-induced systemic SK1/S1P inhibits the expression of a  master suppressor of metastasis (BRMS1) via S1PR2 signaling in cancer cells, inducing tumor metastasis.  Aim 3 is designed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of targeting systemic S1P and/or C5a signaling for the  attenuation of tumor metastasis. In this Aim, our main goal is to test a novel hypothesis that inhibition of  systemic C5aR/SK1/S1P signaling will inhibit tumor metastasis via activation of tumor BRMS1. These studies  will help uncover how cancer cells communicate with the host via SK1/S1P and complement signaling to  regulate tumor metastasis, leading to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of tumor  growth or metastasis. In this project, we will also determine if the elevation of systemic S1P/C5a in patients  with advanced solid tumors will provide novel serum markers for monitoring response to therapy and/or early  detection of progression to metastasis."
"9124514","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is increasing evidence that propensity for weight gain, adiposity and metabolic comorbidities can begin in the womb. Maternal nutrition, in particular adequate protein intake, is critical for normal fetal development and it is well established that malnutrition in utero leads to impaired fetal growth, low or high birth weight and with either phenotype, increased risk for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. The protein leverage hypothesis describes a link between protein and energy intake and specifically demonstrates that protein intake is prioritized over other macronutrients. Protein deficiency therefore promotes counter regulatory mechanisms leading to adaptive increases in total energy intake until protein balance is restored. During gestation, protein demand is increase due to increases in total body protein turnover and protein deposition to the growing fetus and maternal tissues. With the increased protein demanded by gestation and without intentional dietary alteration, pregnant women may be exposing their fetus to unintentional protein restriction during gestation and this protein reduction may leverage an increase in energy intake and create an altered intrauterine environment for the fetus. While the specific mechanistic link(s) between protein sensing and energy intake have not been described, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has been recently discovered to act as a novel endocrine signal in protein restriction with a robust increase in FGF21 and energy intake during protein dilution dietary studies. Thus the key objective of our proposal is to study the role of FGF21 as a  mediator for the protein leverage hypothesis in utero. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that  FGF21 will be increased in pregnant women consuming reduced protein diets during gestation. Compellingly, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and ?-Klotho (cofactor to FGFR which enables FGF21 activity) have been identified in human placenta. Therefore, our second objective is to study whether the metabolic effects from FGF21 (i.e. alterations in nutrient transport) on tissues expressing ?-Klotho are present in the placenta. Accordingly, our Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that FGF21 will modulate nutrient transport into the placenta. The results of the proposed studies will provide important new insight into the role of FGF21 in the protein leverage hypothesis during pregnancy and the metabolic plasticity of the placenta in response to variation in maternal protein intake. Equally important, completion of the outlined training plan by the applicant will supply the field with a well-trained, translational placental researcher who can apply the skills learned through this fellowship to advance the field of future placenta and developmental programming research."
"9207657","Abstract  Azide is a mitochondrial poison, easily obtained, with the potential for use by terrorists. At neutral pH azide exists largely in its anionic form, N3?, is tasteless, odorless and is not easily lost to the environment. It is, therefore, a perfect poison for delivery by ingestion and has been used as such in the United States and Japan. In addition, treatment of sodium azide with acid will generate HN3 gas, which has the potential for causing mass casualties through inhalation. There presently seems to be no approved therapeutic protocol for treating azide-poisoning victims. Similar to cyanide, the azide anion binds to cytochrome c oxidase, a critically important mitochondrial protein, inhibiting electron transport. As the nitrite/thiosulfate combination is an approved antidote for cyanide, others have suggested using this combination for azide poisoning, but we have recently found that nitrite is ineffective as an antidote for azide poisoning and may, in fact, be detrimental. Building on our recent experience with a cobalt(III)- containing water-soluble porphyrin that we have demonstrated to be an effective cyanide antidote in mice [Benz et al (2012) Chem Res Tox, 25, 2678-86; Ibid (2016)] we hypothesize that many compounds in which cobalt(III) is surrounded by a square-planar arrangement of nitrogen-donors with two labile ligands in the axial positions will be good candidate antidotes for azide poisoning. The straightforward syntheses of many inexpensive and stable complexes of cobalt(III) having this necessary surrounding ligand geometry are known and many more are accessible via derivatization of the compounds already in the existing literature. We expect complexes, in which the cobalt(III) ion is retained by polydentate ligands, will be non- toxic at the levels required to be efficacious in treating azide intoxication. Aim 1. Demonstrate that some easily prepared cobalt(II/III) complexes are candidate azide (N3?) antidotes by virtue of their azide binding characteristics in aqueous buffer. Aim 2. Demonstrate in mice the efficacy of the most promising candidate azide antidotes, their inherent safety, and primary route(s) of excretion."
"9167647","PROJECT ABSTRACT Pain is a fundamental protective neuronal signal for organisms to avoid danger. Nociceptors are the specific subset of peripheral sensory neurons that detect harmful/noxious stimuli and transmit pain signals to the brain. Chronic pain is a major socio-economic burden, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. I previously found that bacterial pathogens produced pain by directly activating nociceptor neurons during infection. Moreover, I found that nociceptors played a role in suppressing local immune cell recruitment and lymphadenopathy. These findings raise the possibility that the nervous system can play a direct participatory role in host defense. Nociceptor neurons densely innervate the skin and gut, which are heavily colonized by commensal bacteria. However, the bidirectional crosstalk between the tissue-resident microbes with the sensory nervous system is poorly understood. In this NIH Director's New Innovator Award, I test the hypothesis that molecular interactions between the host microbiota and nociceptor neurons play a key role in governing pain production and the composition of the microbiota. This research is motivated by basic questions about the role of host-microbe interactions that will help us gain insights into mammalian physiology: i) Do specific commensal gut or skin bacterial species (pathobionts or symbionts) set the threshold for nociceptor neuron activity and development of chronic pain? ii) Can we identify specific bacterial molecular mediators that modulate nociceptor neural activity and pain? iii) Do nociceptor-associated ligands in spicy foods (e.g. capsaicin, mustard oil) have a significant impact on the composition and quality of the microbiota? Iv) Do nociceptor neurons produce molecular mediators that directly impact the microbiota or tissue-resident immune cells? To address these questions, I will combine neurobiological, immunological, and microbiological approaches to analyze the reciprocal interactions between nociceptor neurons and the resident microbiota. Germ-free and bacterial monocolonization experiments will determine if distinct symbiotic or pathobiotic commensal bacterial strains influence the development of pain. Neuronal calcium flux, multi-electrode array analysis, and protein chemical techniques will define the bacterial mediators that modulate nociceptor activity. These analyses will lead to the identification of potential novel molecular mediators of pain. Conversely, I will analyze if nociceptor activity in vivo plays a role in regulating the host microbiota. Using transgenic, pharmacological, and optogenetic strategies to specifically deplete, activate or silence nociceptors, I will ascertain whether sensory neurons modulate the composition of the skin and gut microbiota. Based on my foundational training in Immunology and Neurobiology, along with the ability to carry out cross-disciplinary scientific approaches, I am uniquely qualified to lead this effort. I have demonstrated a willingness to challenge convential paradigms, focusing my research on questions that have potential impacts on human health. With this proposed NIH Director's New Innovator Award, I will carry out studies to produce novel insights into host- microbe interactions facilitating the development of treatments for chronic pain and microbial dysbiosis."
"9212390","PROJECT SUMMARY Fewer than half of older adults receive high quality end-of-life care, however not much is known about the quality of end-of-life care experienced by the segment of that population with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Older adults with MCC face unique challenges at the end of life, but few studies explicitly examine their end-of-life care quality. Failure to address the gap in knowledge regarding end-of-life care quality for older adults with MCC could lead to ineffective improvements or policies mismatched with the populations' needs and priorities. This retrospective cross-sectional cohort study investigates the end-of-life care quality experienced by older adults with MCC using the nationally representative National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) Last Month of Life Interview (LMLI). In the LMLI, designated proxies rate overall end-of-life care quality for deceased NHATS participants and report their perception of care in five end-of-life quality domains ( symptom management, shared decision-making, respect, coordination, and spiritual and emotional support). The study's objectives are to assess the presence of MCC as a potential driver of poor end-of-life care quality and inform end-of-life care improvements that meet the needs and interests of older adults with MCC. To meet the objectives, Aim 1 will identify disparities in proxy-reported end-of-life care quality for older adults with MCC compared to those without MCC. Aim 2 will determine which of the five recognized end-of-life quality domains are associated with excellent overall end-of-life care quality for older adults with MCC. Aim 3 will evaluate the relationship between positive perception of care in the coordination quality domain and positive perception of care in other recognized quality domains for older adults with MCC. Findings from this study will: 1) identify whether end-of-life care quality for older adults differs by MCC status, 2) contribute information for prioritizing patient-centered end-of-life care quality improvements, and 3) suggest whether coordination, a strategy that has shown promise for improving care quality prior to end of life, also improves end-of-life care quality for older adults with MCC.The study aligns with AHRQ's mission and strategy by addressing three priority areas: elderly individuals, chronic care, and end-of-life care."
"9144803","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An asymmetry in the visual input across the eyes early in postnatal life causes amblyopia, the most common basis of uniocular blindness in humans. In amblyopia, the nonamblyopic eye dominates control of neuronal responses in the binocular visual cortex, while the ability of the amblyopic eye to stimulate cortical neurons may weaken to the point of functional blindness. Previous attempts to recover vision in adult amblyopes have had modest success, and we propose this is due in large part to the significant reduction of synaptic plasticity that occurs during cortical development. We propose that optimizing recovery from amblyopia in adulthood requires a two stage process: 1) the reactivation of synaptic plasticity in the adult amblyopic cortex (permissive step) and 2) focused visual experience to stimulate perceptual learning (instructive step). Two labs, including the Quinlan lab (Elizabeth Quinlan is a consultant in the proposed work) have recently shown that binocular visual deprivation (BD) in adulthood enhances synaptic plasticity in the adult cortex of experimental animals. In addition, BD prior to repetitive visual experience stimulates the recovery of spatial acuity in animal models of deep amblyopia. Here we propose to translate this finding to the treatment of amblyopia in humans. We propose to use 5 and 10 days of binocular visual deprivation (in other words, living in complete darkness) to promote synaptic plasticity in the amblyopic visual cortex, followed by 8 weeks of visual perceptual learning, to stimulate the recovery of visual function. While visual perceptual learning has been previously shown to enhance visual function in amblyopic adults, the gains are slow and modest. We predict that pre-treatment of the amblyopic visual system with binocular visual deprivation will enhance the magnitude and/or time course of learning-induced recovery from amblyopia. The team of investigators assembled to test this hypothesis is ideally composed for a comprehensive analysis of visual functions, including both psychophysics and physiology, to track changes in visual function at key milestones during the experiment. If successful, this work would transform therapy for adult amblyopia, and focus attention on the importance of enhancing synaptic plasticity as an adjunct to treatment and training in the central nervous system. Insights gained from this work could be extended to strabismus, eye movement control disorders, and the restoration of optimal neural function after damage from traumatic brain injury. The proposed experiments will also pioneer the use of binocular visual deprivation in human amblyopes, and develop standards for implementation, including participant care, monitoring, and safety during sequestration."

Our long-term objectives focus on expansion of scientific knowledge and increased use of evidence-based public health programs that advances the national health agenda as reflected in Healthy People 2020's adolescent-focused goals (5 of 7 priority areas), promotes health equity as articulated in the National Prevention Strategy, and addresses CDC adolescent-related Winnable Battles (i.e., reproductive health).  The UMN PRC core project, Partnering for Healthy Student Outcomes (PHSO) is a comparative study of the relative effectiveness of a school-based, social-emotional learning (SEL) prevention program for students attending culturally diverse, economically disadvantaged middle schools in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN metro area. Our primary research question is: Will a multi-year, school-based prevention program, infused with professional development (PD) aimed at increasing the capacity of middle school teacher teams to engage their students in learning, yield changes in middle school students' health risk behaviors and academic outcomes that exceed outcomes from a school-based student-focused prevention program alone? The research has two primary aims:  Primary Aim 1: Conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a school-based, SEL+PD program (Positive Action plus teacher-team professional development and support) designed to reduce health risk behaviors (violence, bullying, substance use, sexual risk behaviors) and increase academic achievement among middle school students; and  Primary Aim 2: Implement a SEL plus teacher-team professional development program and evaluate its effectiveness on student outcomes compared to a SEL program alone.  We will evaluate the two conditions in a matched pairs, randomized trial involving approximately 840 students in 4 urban middle level schools across 3 school years."

Within ABCs and FoodNet, active surveillance for specific organisms will be done, and multi-site projects related to disease etiology and risk factors will be developed, conducted, analyzed and published. Syndromic surveillance projects for evaluation of tools such as the rash illness algorithm, and identification of SARS-like illnesses among healthcare workers will also be conducted. The EIP concept allows in-depth study of diseases and risk factors- multiple state involvement allows an increase in sample size, thus increased statistical power to examine differences between groups, and examination of differences in incidence and risk factors by geographic area and demographic group. The collaboration between state and local health departments, the CDC, USDA, FDA and other federal agencies and multiple academic institutions is strength of the EIP. Studies are developed, piloted, conducted and analyzed with input and expertise from collaborators at all levels of government and academia. This broad input results in scientifically rigorous studies which often have practical, applied public health imptications for intervention+ Georgia has a long history of good performance in the EIP.

"9236808","PROJECT SUMMARY Reducing use of low-value care ? care for which potential for harm exceeds the possible benefit ? is an attractive but elusive goal in health care. It is one of the few opportunities to increase quality while decreasing spending on care, but there was traditionally little consensus on what constitutes low-value care and little opportunity to measure it and design interventions to target it. That has changed in recent years as a result of physician-led efforts in the United States and other countries to build consensus around what tests and procedures qualify as low-value, and a number of preliminary analyses aimed at quantifying use of low-value care, particularly among Medicare beneficiaries. Many services identified as low-value are routine imaging and laboratory tests. These services can be relatively low-cost and low-risk but they may initiate a cascade of subsequent services, or an entire patient episode of low-value care, with much greater impact on both patient outcomes and health care spending. Little is know about (i) the prevalence and variation in episodes of low- value care, including the cost of subsequent related services stemming from the index test; (ii) the effect of payment reform interventions on use of low-value care and related episodes; and (iii) which characteristics best position a provider organization to reduce use of low-value care. Addressing these knowledge gaps and reducing low-value care will both decrease harm to patients and reduce unnecessary spending. Aim 1 of this study is to construct episodes of low-value testing that include tests, procedures, and treatments related to an initial low-value test, and examine the prevalence and cost per episode. This analysis will build upon previously developed claims-based measures of overuse, and rely on use of 100% fee-for-service Medicare data. Aim 2 will focus on the effect of accountable care organization (ACO) implementation on utilization of episodes of low-value care. The Affordable Care Act authorized the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to contract with ACOs, networks of providers responsible for the health care of a defined population. ACO providers are rewarded financially if they can slow growth in their patients? health care spending while maintaining or improving the quality of care they deliver. Aim 2 will involve assigning Medicare beneficiaries to ACOs using claims data and examining utilization and costs of episodes of low-value care pre- and post-ACO implementation in Medicare ACOs as compared with local control groups. Data from four waves of The National Survey of ACOs will then be linked with Medicare claims to understand, in Aim 3, which ACO characteristics are most closely associated with successful reduction in utilization of low-value care. We will also interview ten high-performing ACOs to identify tactics, facilitators, and challenges to reducing low- value services. This study will provide tools for future measurement of episodes of low-value care and inform the evolution of ACO policy as it pertains to the model?s capacity to reduce utilization of low-value care."
"9153333","Project Summary/Abstract Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of intellectual disability and autism as a result of mutations to a single gene. Approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females are diagnosed with FXS. The disorder causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Hyperactive behavior and anxiety are common in children with FXS and they may be diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. About one-third of afflicted individuals have features of autism spectrum disorders while seizures occur in 15 percent of males and 5 percent of females. Loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is the root cause of FXS. FMRP is an important RNA binding protein that regulates translation of a wide variety of proteins in neuronal dendrites and synapses, the specialized structures that form connections between neurons. One widely reported feature of FXS is the increased tendency for neurons to fire electrical impulses. Neurons are complex structures, and while the axon fires electrical signals to other neurons, it is the large tree like structure formed by the dendrites that receives thousands of synaptic inputs and is responsible for bringing the neuron to the firing threshold. Surprisingly, very little is known about how FMRP regulates local translation of important proteins in synapses and dendrites that regulate excitability. In aim 1, we will determine how FMRP regulates dendritic protein synthesis and excitability using new techniques to visualize newly synthesized proteins and to excite dendrites and spines locally. Dendrite excitation is a result of electrical gradients brought about by synaptic transmission and this is critically dependent upon ion channels. In aim 2, we will determine the role of FMRP in regulating translation of two particular ion channels that we have identified as both important for dendritic excitability and are regulated by FMRP function. At the conclusion of these studies we will have expanded our knowledge of FMRP function in local translation at synapses of hippocampal neurons. In particular, we will visualize and measure FMRP translational regulation of two ion channels that are critical determinants of neuronal excitability. The results of these studies may lead to identification of new drug targets in the treatment of Fragile X Syndrome."
"9172623","DESCRIPTION:      Pain management has been identified as a priority area in VA clinical care, and chronic back pain is a leading cause of disability for US veterans. The role in back pain of psychiatric disorders such as post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been well studied in Veterans. For example, while there is a high co-occurrence of PTSD with chronic pain in Veterans, it remains unknown whether PTSD is a risk factor for the development of pain, or whether this co-occurrence is due to other factors such as shared familial predispositions. In addition, there have been no studies to date examining the genomics of back pain in Veterans. We propose a study of back pain in older Veterans who are members of the Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry. The Registry is comprised of 7369 male-male twin pairs, both of whom served in the military during the Vietnam conflict (1964-1975). We will capitalize on the rich data available in the Registry, and the recently completed study entitled, 'CSP 569: A Twin Study of the Course and Consequences of PTSD in Vietnam Era Veterans'. Our project consists of 3 interrelated components. First, we will analyze detailed information on PTSD and back pain from amongst the 7332 veterans who participated in CSP 569. Second, we will follow 171 MZ twin pairs who are discordant for PTSD symptoms, but are concordant for absence of back pain at baseline, for the occurrence of back pain. The longitudinal MZ co-twin design allows examination of the effect of an exposure while controlling for shared genetics and family environment. Third, we will conduct an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with prevalent chronic back pain and back pain risk factors using recently acquired biospecimens from the VET Registry Biorepository. We will further cross-reference identified DMRs with existing databases of genes associated with known pain mechanisms, and conduct pathway analyses to identify specific biological networks which may be implicated in the production of pain. The candidate, Dr. Pradeep Suriyaarachchi, MD, MS is a physiatrist with subspecialty training in Pain Medicine and clinical expertise in back pain management. His career goal is to become an independent VA Investigator conducting epidemiologic research focused on the prevention of back pain, and improving function for Veterans with chronic back pain. His background is in clinical epidemiology, but he seeks to gain training in contemporary genetic epidemiology, genomics, and bioinformatics, in order to gain insights into the etiology of back pain, and to develop new interventions for back pain and related disability. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the leadership of primary mentor Dr. Edward Boyko, MD, MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, genomics, and bioinformatics, as well as the clinical domains of back pain and rehabilitation. The CDA-2 will allow Dr. Suriyaarachchi the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills in genetic epidemiology and genomics. Structured learning experiences will include formal coursework and seminars, regular local conferences, and attendance at scientific meetings. He will take advantage of key local resources to carry out the proposed research and training in the centers where his mentors are based, including the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center (where he is an investigator), the VET Registry, and the University of Washington's Department of Genome Sciences and Comparative Effectiveness, Cost, and Outcomes Research Center (which specializes in back pain research). This outstanding local environment will help ensure Dr. Suriyaarachchi's success."
"9215383","Parkinson?s Disease: Predicting the Future It is poorly understood why some patients with Parkinson?s have an aggressive disease course. The pace of progression varies considerably, ranging from a manageable functional decline to an accelerated course that leaves patients rapidly wheelchair bound or with dementia. This is a source of anguish for patients and caregivers. In clinical trials, this variation obfuscates drug effects. Many genetic variants have been linked to susceptibility, but the genes modulating disease progression have not been well established. Our initial studies indicate multiple coding and noncoding variants predictive of a hyper-accelerated motor or memory decline.  We hypothesize that genetic variants will powerfully predict the progression of Parkinson?s. We will directly address this question through high coverage, massively parallel, targeted sequencing of ten cohorts from North America and Europe that were longitudinal characterized with exceptional granularity over the course of up to twelve years. 3,939 patients with Parkinson?s disease and over thirty thousand clinical assessments will be analyzed using Cox and mixed random and fixed effect models. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variants in susceptibility loci and familial genes that predict cognitive or motor progression. Furthermore, novel putative progression loci emerging from our exome-scale search will be evaluated. In Aim 2, we will replicate and verify forwarded genetic variants in independent populations.  This study will establish the first progression genes for Parkinson?s disease, clarify prognosis, and shift the way we design clinical trials. Rare variants that disrupt protein function will inform on the underlying mechanism and reveal clues for therapies. More generally, these data will contribute towards a precision medicine poised to transform healthcare."

"9130133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory chemokines CCL3 (MIP-1?) and CCL4 (MIP-1?) are important in orchestrating nonrandom naive CD8+ T cell contacts with dendritic cells in vaccinated lymph nodes (LNs) and can enhance memory T cell generation. We hypothesize that incorporating CCL3 and CCL4 into tumor microenvironment can enhance anti-tumor immunity. Using the murine colon tumor model CT26, we generated tumors that secret CCL3 or CCL4 and inoculate them live into the footpad of naïve immunocompetent recipients. Tumor growth kinetic measurements showed that CCL3-secreting tumors resulted in either a CD8+ T cell dependent slowing of tumor progression or complete regression in immunocompetent mice and protected subsequent lethal tumor challenge when used as a vaccine. Next, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) we analyzed the effects of lymphocyte recruitment to the LN draining the metastatic tumor by fluorescence- activated cell sorting analysis 3 and 5 days post-tumor injection. Mice inoculated with CCL3-secreting tumors resulted in similar increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ranging from 1.3 to 1.7-fold increase from WT tumors and 1.3-fold increase from CCL4-secreting tumors on day 3. By day 5 the T cell accumulation in CCL3- secreting tumors reached similar levels as that of WT and CCL4-secreting tumors. Furthermore, dynamic intravital 2-photon microscopy and tissue histology studies further revealed that tumors occupy the B-cell follicle during early metastasis, and exogenous CCL3 and CCL4 gradient may potentially alter lymphocyte homeostasis in tumor draining LNs, resulting in immune activation rather than tolerance against CT26. We propose to interrogate biological effect of CCL3 on immune cell recruitment, activation, retention and effector functional delivery in the draining LNs following CCL3- or CCL4-secreting CT26 tumor inoculation. These studies include functional activation, migration and chemokine receptor expression of dendritic cells and lymphocytes upon exposure to CCL3. Furthermore, we propose to study the dynamic cell-cell interaction between CCL3-secreting, CCL4-secreting, or wild type CT26 tumor cells and various immune cells in the tumor-infiltrating LN within the first 5 days following tumor inoculation. These studies will provide scientific rationale for the exploration of incorporating inflammatory chemokines such as CCL3 as a therapeutic adjuvant to anti-tumor immunotherapy."

The initial work will focus on measuring EDRN candidate biomarkers in prostate cancer specimens (tissue, plasma, serum and urine). However, the measurements will be later extended to include additional candidate biomarkers for cancers supported by the EDRN including cancers of the bladder, pancreas, liver, colon, lung, breast and ovaries. Currently, the limit of detection of a serum or plasma or urine biomarker, using high-pressure high-resolution separation coupled with intelligent selection and multiplexing (PRISM) LC-SRM-MS, is ~50 pg/mL and limit of detection of a tissue biomarker is ~2 amol/µg of tumor tissue."
"9196040","The Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Center of Excellence for Parkinson's Disease Research at Emory University is a collaborative research program in which electrophysiologists and anatomists study the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and examine and optimize the effects of existing treatments for Parkinson's disease. The Center draws upon the proven ability of the basal ganglia research community at Emory to conduct translational research. Other Udall Center assets are its close ties to the clinical movement disorders group at Emory, and the availability of primates for research at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University. Emory is strongly committed to the Udall Center's research, and supports the Center by funding pilot grants, invited speakers, and portions of its education and outreach programs.  The Center consists of three tightly linked projects and two cores. The planned research will shed light on the poorly understood parkinsonism-related activity changes in thalamus and cortex which, in turn, will help us to better understand the pathophysiology of parkinsonism, and to optimize existing neuromodulation strategies and to develop new ones. Project 1 (led by Dr. Jaeger) will utilize brain slice and in vivo recordings in rodents, as well as a neural computational approach to develop mechanistic models of thalamocortical dysfunction in parkinsonism. Project 2 (Dr. Wichmann), will continue the exploration of thalamic and cortical abnormalities in parkinsonian monkeys, using selective activation and inactivation approaches which are designed to study corticothalamic, pallidothalamic and thalamocortical information transfer. Project 3 (Dr. Smith) will examine morphological changes in the thalamic and cortical microcircuitry in parkinsonian primates, a topic that is virtually unexplored at this time and of high relevance to the interpretation of data in the other projects. All projects will be supported by an Administrative Core (Dr. Wichmann, PI; Dr. DeLong, Co-I, Dr. Smith, Co-I, Ms Holbrook, administrator), and by an Anatomy and Behavior Core (Dr. Galvan) which will provide immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy services to all of the center projects, and standardized MPTP treatment and quantification of parkinsonism to the primate experiments in Projects 2 and 3.  In addition to pursuing its research mission (Aim 1), the Center will help junior scientists to develop their career in Parkinson's disease research (Aim 2), and will engage in extensive outreach efforts, aimed at communicating the Center's (and Udall Center network) research findings to the public (Aim 3), reaching all age groups and background levels, ranging from K-12 children to retirees in assisted living facilities. As part of the outreach agenda, the center plans to organize annual symposia for patients and their caregivers. The center will be generously supported by the University. These internal support funds will help the Center to fund some of its education and outreach missions, as well as its pilot grant program, designed to expand Parkinson's disease research at Emory University."

"9346151","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of this project is to better understand tRNA function, regulation, and the dynamic contributions of individual tRNAs within the cell. Given the rapidly growing collection of genomic data and high throughput RNA detection methods, there are new opportunities to advance tRNA research if known limitations in our computational and molecular detection methods are overcome. Thus, the aims of this grant are:  (1) To expand and improve the technology of computational tRNA detection,  (2) To provide a comprehensive database and advanced analysis tools enabling new biological insights  and experimentation by the tRNA research community,  (3) To measure the complex dynamics of tRNA abundance to understand the regulation and cellular roles  of individual tRNA gene loci  (4) To identify and test the biological contribution of atypical but evolutionarily recurrent tRNAs which  challenge our conventional understanding of tRNA sequence and structure  To achieve these aims, we will develop improved tRNA detection methods based on a greatly expanded sampling of tRNA diversity, with new, more specialized probabilistic search models. With major improvements in the design, content, and function of the Genomic tRNA Database, we will provide the most complete and up-to-date collection of tRNAs and on-line tools for tRNA researchers. To link expression data to specific tRNA loci, we will collect a wide phylogenetic sampling of tRNA-seq data, utilizing specialized mapping and normalization methods. To better understand what distinguishes a functional tRNA from a pseudogene, we will use comparative genomics and traditional biochemistry to assay function of a diverse set of natural tRNA variants in yeast.  These tools, data resources, and studies will enable and accelerate biomedical research in the tRNA community. tRNA researches study a wide variety of human diseases that can be caused by mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs including diabetes, blindness, myoclonic epilepsy, cardiomyopathy, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and neurosensory hearing loss. Because increased tRNA abundance is required for rapid cell division in tumorigenesis, identification of disregulated tRNA loci could lead to new targets for cancer therapies. Finally, processing, editing, and modification of tRNAs differ in many ways between bacteria and eukaryotes - closer study of these phylogenetic differences could offer opportunities to develop novel antibiotics based on pathogen-specific tRNA processing enzymes."
"9162978","ABSTRACT Fluorescence is the current standard method of choice for intravital microscopy and cytometry. However, the broad emission spectrum of fluorescent probes?dyes, fluorescent probes, and quantum dots?limits the number of cells that can be tracked simultaneously without ambiguity. DNA barcodes can label cells but cannot be visualized in vivo, as they require in vitro genetic reading. The optical principle of stimulated emission and cavity resonance used in a laser can generate extremely narrow spectral line-widths over a broad spectral range. This project will miniaturize lasers to the sizes of mitochondria or viruses and develop instrumentations to utilize the laser particles as novel probes for massively parallel imaging and assays. By tracing individual cells over time in mice, the proliferation, migrations and cell-cell and cell-tissue interactions can be studied in vivo. The cells can be further analyzed by flow cytometry and sorted for gene profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing, providing comprehensive information from molecular, cellular, tissue, and systems levels over millions to billions of cells in a single animal experiment. The first specific aim is to create a new paradigm for imaging-compatible cellular labeling using injectable, biocompatible micro- and submicron-cavity lasers. The second aim is to develop Laser Particle Stimulated Emission (LASE) Microscopy for conducting labeled microscopy in vivo at depths of up to 3 mm. The third specific aim is to demonstrate massively multiplexed, high-throughput cell tracking and analysis. The breakthrough capabilities will be used to dissect tumor heterogeneity in progression, metastasis, and response to therapy at unprecedented single-cell resolution."
"9228761","Project Summary Foreign body reaction (FBR) happens to nearly all devices implanted to the body, and results in avascular fibrotic tissue deposition surrounding the implant surface, a drastic decrease of blood supply and molecular transport to the implant. FBR causes detrimental problems to the long- term functioning of current technologies to address T1D, such as subcutaneous (s.c.) insulin infusion sets, implantable glucose sensors, artificial pancreas devices by combining both glucose sensing and insulin infusion, and biomaterial-encapsulated islet transplants. Most state- of-the-art technologies have very short usage time range; For example, current infusion set needs to change and rotate its insertion site every 2-3 days to maintain healthy and vascularized infusion site, and to enhance consistent insulin absorption. Despite a strong need for overcoming FBR to fundamentally improve the longevity of device outcome, there is no effective way to do so. The long-term research goal of the PI is to develop a novel formulation as a platform technology that can be easily applied on surfaces of most existing devices to be s.c. implanted. Its major function is to resist FBR, and boost the long-term performance of its modified implanted devices. The objective of this T1D Pathfinder Award is to develop a particular type of such formulation to drastically improve the longevity of subcutaneous insulin infusion set. Two main tasks of the award involve the identification of the mechanism of failure for implanted infusion set, and identification of key formulation that prevents infusion set from stimulating FBR and retains normal insulin absorption in practical wear condition. Immunocompetent diabetic mice and rats induced by streptozotocin will be used as animal models in this study. The success of this project will directly result in an extended wear duration of commercial infusion sets and patch pumps to match the wear duration of commercial implantable glucose sensor- a technology advancement benefiting majority patients with T1D. The developed implant mate can also be applied on implanted glucose sensor to drastically increase the longevity of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The resulting advancement on both infusion sets and CGM in an artificial pancreas configuration will achieve a transformative impact in managing T1D. The novel topical formulation to resist FBR will also impact a broad range of implantation applications beyond T1D."
"9260420","PROJECT SUMMARY Dendrites are long thin processes on which a neuron receives synaptic connections from other neurons. Numerous voltage-gated channels present in dendrites transform signals arriving along these connections, altering how neurons interpret each others? messages. This electrical activity interacts with sophisticated gene transcription and protein translation machinery present in the dendrite. Dendrites are therefore sites of spatially and temporally complex integration of electrical and chemical signaling networks operating in parallel and interacting with another. Numerous human diseases and disorders are now known to involve disruptions of dendritic structure, function. Dendrites? remarkable capacity for change is thought to underlie normal learning and memory, and dysfunction within such plasticity mechanisms has been repeatedly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. The 2017 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together scientists of all levels who study these issues at the molecular, cellular, computational, circuit, and behavioral levels. The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites."
"9235849","Candida albicans (CA) colonization is required for invasive disease. Adult mice are resistant to CA gastrointestinal (GI) colonization. We have identified two genetically distinct anaerobic commensal bacteria that can individually maintain CA colonization resistance in germ-free mice. These anaerobic commensals induce host immune effectors (transcription factor, HIF1-?, and antimicrobial peptide, CRAMP/LL-37) that significantly decrease CA GI colonization. By pharmacologically inducing both HIF1-? and CRAMP, we were able to significantly reduce CA colonization and reduce mortality from CA dissemination by 50%. Interestingly, the anaerobic bacteria that can expel CA from the gut share the ability to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAS have been shown to have numerous immunomodulatory properties. Therefore, my central hypothesis is that SCFAs produced by gut commensal anaerobic bacteria are necessary to maintain CA colonization resistance. This work will involve two specific aims. First, I will determine whether SCFAs are necessary for CA colonization resistance. I will evaluate whether commensal anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotamicron mutants unable to produce SCFAs or SCFAs alone can reduce CA colonization. I predict that SCFAs are necessary for maintaining CA colonization resistance. Second, I will determine if HIF-1? and/or CRAMP are necessary for SCFA-induced GI colonization reduction. I will evaluate whether SCFAs can promote CA clearance in cultured human and mouse gut epithelial cells and CA colonization reduction in Hif1a and Cramp knockout mice. I predict that HIF1-? and CRAMP are necessary for maintaining CA colonization resistance. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with invasive fungal infections, the limited arsenal of antifungal antibiotics, and the continuing emergence of antibiotic resistant strains, new approaches to treating and preventing invasive fungal infections in patients are desperately needed. Using natural occurring anaerobic bacterial metabolites (SCFAs) to boost GI mucosal immune effectors to reduce fungal colonization and ultimately decrease dissemination could represent paradigm shift in the way we prevent/treat fungal infections in patients. These studies will lay the groundwork for the following innovations: 1) a novel mechanism by which SCFAs activate gut immune defenses to maintain CA colonization resistance; 2) a novel approach (SCFAs) to inhibit CA dissemination; and 3) a novel approach to preventing fungal infections in patients. Together, these studies should lead to fundamental insights into bacterial/fungal interactions within the intestinal tract and will provide new perspectives in combating invasive fungal disease in the human host."
"9136225","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the vast diversity of its populations, genetic studies in Africa have been limited. African populations, Malians in particular, have a high rate o intra-ethnic and consanguineous marriage, resulting in increased prevalence of autosomal recessive diseases. Family-based genetic studies can be limited in developed countries due to small sib ships. The average fertility rate in Mali is over 6 births per woman, offering a unique opportunity to find new disease genes or mutations that can then be studied in other populations. Hereditary neurological diseases are very debilitating diseases, and developing countries, particularly in Africa, pay a high price in terms of disability-adjusted life years. Although most are currently untreatable, increasing awareness about hereditary neurological disorders can reduce this burden. This study will help to identify and characterize novel hereditary neurological disease genes in Mali. These genes are likely to be important in the normal function of the nervous system and to have important pathophysiological implications for African and other populations. This study will also train physicians and students in the characterization of neurodegenerative diseases as well as in genetic technology and molecular biology, and build a suitable research environment that will retain them."
"9093135","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad goals of this project are to explore adaptation and learning in response to repeated presentation of temporal sequences of visual stimuli. These studies are motivated by broader ideas about how local circuits in the neocortex may be carrying out predictive computations on their inputs. Such ideas could lead to new insights into the function of the human cerebral cortex, and hence have many possible medical and technological applications. In the proposal, we describe preliminary data taken in collaboration with the Tank lab at Princeton. We first performed behavioral experiments in which we trained mice to lick in response to a violation of a repeated temporal sequence. This behavior was robust and emerged rapidly, often on the first day of training. Next, we used two-photon imaging to record from neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse V1. We found that neurons rapidly modified their responses during repeated presentation of temporal sequences. Most of the neurons adapted rapidly to the presentation of repeated temporal sequences of oriented spatial images, reaching essentially zero baseline response in several seconds (what we call the `transient response'). Then, these same neurons generate a strong response to a novel spatial image that violates the ongoing temporal sequence. In addition, we find a small subset of neurons (roughly 2 in 100) that produce a sustained response to repeated temporal sequences. This sustained response ramped up over several cycles of the sequence. Then, on a longer time scale, it exhibited some features of learning, such as an anticipatory shift to earlier times s well as a form of pattern completion when presented with a novel image. We propose to extend our studies in two ways: 1) consolidate our behavioral measurements over a larger cohort of animals with identical shaping and training histories; 2) study how these responses change during training in animals engaged in the behavioral task."
"9045029","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare condition that is thought to occur as a result of an interaction between genetic risk and environmental exposures. Although a number of major genes are known to cause ALS in up to 15% of patients with a familial form of the disease, the precise genetic factors that increase risk in the remainin 85% o are not well understood. Similarly, the environmental factors that increase risk have not been well established. The availability of population-based disease registers have allowed us to accurately calculate the incidence of ALS in populations of European ancestral origin. These registers have also allowed us to conduct large studies of cases and controls to increase our understanding of environmental risk factors, and to begin to understand gene-environment interactions that might increase this risk of developing ALS.  Conversely, little is known about the true rates or characteristics of the condition in populations outside of Europe and the United States, and in those of mixed ancestral origin. There is some evidence to suggest that the rates of ALS are lower in the Hispanic population in North America, but this may be due to difficulties encountered by minorities in accessing healthcare. Because ALS is rare large scale population based studies of incidence, prevalence, phenotype and risk factors are necessary. Detailed population based studies including all minority groups are challenging to perform in the United States, notwithstanding the recent development of the CDC ALS Registry. Moreover, the ALS Registry does not have the facility to capture incident cases in real time. We have already undertaken a large population based incident study in Europe as part of a Research Consortium (The European multidisciplinary ALS network identification to cure motor neurone degeneration, EuroMOTOR). To understand the impact of ancestral origin and geographic exposure on ALS in the United States, we now propose to use the methods developed by our EuroMOTOR Consortium study ALS in 3 populations from South America that are of mixed ancestral origin. The purpose of this study is to compare the rates and features of ALS in Hispanic populations with the rates and features of ALS in European populations. We will also use our established methods to collect information about occupational history and various exposures to determine whether the risks in Hispanic patients from South America are similar to those we identify in European populations. The outcome of this work will establish for the first time whether Hispanic populations in the Americas have lower rates of ALS compared to Europeans, whether the features of the disease are the same, and whether the risks of developing the disease differ depending on geographic and ancestral origin. This will help to understand the variance in ALS rates across the United States, and will help to test the hypothesis that Hispanic populations in the United States are protected from developing the disease. This in turn will help us to develop new models of disease causation in the United States ALS population, that can in turn help us to find new therapies for all forms of ALS."
"9185236","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Many persons with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D) use a wheelchair for mobility, which keeps them in a seated position for long periods of time. A major complication of wheelchair use is the development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged sitting. Most maneuvers intended to offload sitting surface tissues (e.g. wheelchair pushups, tilts or leans) take the person away from their normal activities and may require longer periods of time than previously thought to provide any benefit. Currently available standing devices allow patients to stand as an alternative means for relieving pressure, but none allow the user to manually wheel about his/her environment when in a fully standing position. The ability to be mobile in the standing position should increase the utility of these systems, increase dosages of standing, and subsequently lead to reductions in secondary complications associated with prolonged sitting. The primary goal of this project is to develop a commercially-viable mobile manual standing wheelchair in close collaboration with a standing wheelchair company. During the first year of the project, a mobile manual standing wheelchair prototype will be developed for a Veteran with a spinal cord injury between the levels of T5 and T8. This wheelchair will be designed to mimic the seating configuration of the Veteran's usual wheelchair (e.g. seat and backrest angles, foot rest height) to allow for comparison of the new mobile manual standing wheelchair with the usual wheelchair. The subject will undergo Wheelchair Skills Testing with (1) their usual wheelchair, (2) the mobile manual standing wheelchair in a seated posture, and (3) the mobile manual standing wheelchair in a standing posture. During the 100 meter test, the subject will also be timed and propulsion cadence will be measured along with perceived exertion on a 10 point Borg scale. Higher speed, lower cadence, and lower perceived exertion will be indicative of improved propulsion efficiency. The subject will also work with therapists in the Minneapolis VA SCI/D Center's apartment to identify possible problems with using the device in the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Information gathered during these tests will be used to improve the design. Retesting of the mobile manual standing wheelchair prototypes will occur after each design iteration. In the second year of the project, two additional mobile manual standing wheelchairs will be developed for two additional Veterans with SCI/D (T1-T4 level and T9-T12 level) and testing will be conducted using the same protocol as for the first subject. In parallel,  the first subject's wheelchair will be tested for durability at the standing wheelchair company using the multi-drum test and the drop test. Design changes will be made to address any failures that occur during durability testing. In year 3 of the project, the second and third subjects' wheelchairs will be sent to the Pittsburgh VA Health Care System for more extensive ANSI/RESNA testing. Any additional design changes that are needed to address failures will be made and testing will be repeated. The end result of the proposed work will be a commercially-viable product that has been developed in close collaboration with a standing wheelchair company. There is a high likelihood that this system will be commercialized after this project, providing Veterans with SCI/D an important new technology that promotes standing and reduces secondary complications of prolonged sitting, such as pressure ulcers."
"9138582","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) viruses belong to the family Filoviridae and can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers characterized by widespread tissue destruction with an incubation period of 4-14 days. Because of the safety concerns, these viruses are designated as the biosafety level 4 agents. Currently there is no effective vaccine or therapeutic treatment against filoviral infection and pathogenesis in humans. Africa has recently suffered a lethal EBOV epidemic, which has spilled over to other continents, including the United States, underscoring the urgency of antiviral drug discovery and development. This application defines a plan to develop potent, small molecule inhibitors, which block entry of EBOV. We have identified compounds that inhibit entry of infectious EBOV/MARV (IC50 values ?25 µM). These hit compounds exhibit selectivity for EBOV/MARV entry. The overall objective of this Phase I application is to develop these inhibitors as potential anti-EBOV therapeutics. This application will focus on the following three specific aims: (1) Synthesize structurally diverse analogs of the anti- Ebola CBS1111 hit series based on structure-activity relationships (SARs) to improve potency and selectivity. (2) Validate the lead inhibitor candidates in the infectious assay and investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) of the EBOV inhibitors. (3) Select EBOV inhibitors with in vitro ADME properties suitable for i.v. and oral dosing."
"9175585","PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic mutations causing disease may be inherited, newly acquired in parental gametes and present in the zygote, or acquired as somatic events at some point in development after fertilization (post-zygotic). The burden and localization of any acquired mutation depends on when the mutation arises. As is the case for inherited genetic variation, there is accumulating evidence that somatic mutations can lead to severe tissue- specific disease. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) represent a group of disorders characterized by a range of morphological and structural abnormalities of the cerebral cortex reflecting errors in embryonic cortical development. MCD are associated with intellectual disability, as well as refractory epilepsy, and may require the surgical removal of the affected tissue. Inherited gene mutations involved in neuronal development explain only a fraction of MCD cases. These observations have led to the hypothesis that some MCD result from somatic mutations occurring in neuroglial progenitor cells give rise to abnormal cortical development. In fact, we and others have shown that in hemimegalencephaly, a severe hemispheric MCD subtype, ~30% of patients have somatic mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, detectable only by directly studying abnormal cortical tissue. Thus, in this project we will evaluate the hypothesis that somatic mutations disrupt embryonic cortical development and are responsible for a substantial fraction of MCD. We, with a network of collaborators, have access to a large number of resected epilepsy surgical tissue specimens. Using high-coverage next-generation sequencing of protein-coding regions in DNA extracted from abnormal brain tissue and unaffected tissue (leukocytes) from patients with three forms of MCD, we will identify somatic mutations within each patient with MCD (Aim 1). Somatic mutations confirmed to be selectively present in affected tissue will be assessed for their likelihood of being responsible for the cortical abnormality using comparisons of patterns of somatic mutations between cases and controls, phenotypic comparisons between individuals with somatic candidates in the same gene, patterns of mutations in pathologically abnormal and normal cell populations, and evaluations of the effects of the candidate mutation on cerebral cortical development in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, initial characterization of the effects and presentation of the disease- causing mutation in the cortex will be studied using in vitro assays to evaluate the effects of the mutation on key cortical developmental processes, and mutation lineage tracing to identify cell populations carrying the mutation (Aim 3). Our project brings together clinical, genetic, and neurobiological expertise and builds on the activities of the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP), Epi4K, and multiple NINDS-funded initiatives in somatic genetics. These studies will: (i) provide the first detailed assessment of the role of somatic mutations across MCD subtypes, (ii) identify novel genes/pathways underlying cortical development, and (iii) establish and test in vitro and in vivo models to understand the role of genes in cortical development."
"9197816","This goal of this application is to establish a clinical center at Wake Forest University Health Sciences in the MACH14 trial. The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow- up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9235772","ABSTRACT  Gastroparesis (GP) is defined as delayed gastric emptying in the absence of a gross structural abnormality with the symptoms chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and abdominal distention. Pain or discomfort is frequently associated. A factor associated with improvement was anti-depressant use and factors associated with no symptom reduction included use of pain modulators, moderate to severe abdominal pain, and moderate to severe depression. The common theme of poor prognosis are factors which may arise from pathology that exist beyond just enteric motor function despite the fact that gastroparesis is indeed initially defined as an enteric motor disorder. Although the causes of gastroparesis can be multi-factorial, when the disease becomes chronic and the severity of the symptoms result in a high impact on Quality of Life (QOL), complex pathologies may begin to evolve in the enteric and central nervous system beyond just motor abnormalities contributing to other sensory defects. The neurobiology of these other factors needs to be explored further so that these insights can be translated into meaningful increases in treatment success in the moderate to severe gastroparetic patients. To accomplish these goals, we propose to create an additional site with the New England Gastroparesis Collaborative to join the NIH GR. The multi-center network will help recruit to our proposal to explore the peripheral and central neurobiology of gastroparesis and as well as help to conduct a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention to target these challenging pathologies. We plan to explore the relationships with gastroparesis symptoms, clinical co- comorbidities such as pain, depression, anxiety and catastrophization, and other GI physiological testing such as gastric emptying scitigraphy (GES), Wireless Motility Capsule (WMC), Electrogastrography (EGG) and Liquid Meal Satiety Drink Tests (SDT). We will perform a placebo controlled CBT trial in GP to examine the non- pharmacological impact of this treatment option on gastroparesis symptoms and the other clinical co-comorbidities such as pain, depression, anxiety and catastrophization. A subset of the CBT trial patients will undergo careful phenotyping pre/post intervention with brain MRI, AFT, and other GI physiological testing: GES, WMC, EGG and SDT to determine the impact of CBT on these physiologies. Characterization of these relationships or lack thereof can help guide future development of more targeted effective approaches in gastroparesis."
"9354303","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A widely-held vision arising from the Human Genome Project is use of newly available genetic information to guide preventive and therapeutic decision making in individual patients. One therapeutic area that seems particularly ripe to test this concept is pharmacogenomics, the idea that variability in therapeutic response includes a genomic component. Common variation in both germline and somatic tumor genes is an increasingly well-recognized contributor to variability in drug response, and as a result, recommendations for genotype-guided therapy are being promulgated. Through leadership in multiple genomic networks, Vanderbilt has been at the forefront of pharmacogenomic discovery and translation of this knowledge into clinical practice locally. However, few institutions or practitioners have the procedures and tools in place to incorporate genetic data into routine drug prescribing. In this proposal, we move toward this practice by establishing a program for integrating genomic medicine in diverse healthcare settings. The purpose of the Integrated, Individualized, and Intelligent Prescribing (I3P) project is to perform a multi-site demonstration that integrating genetic data within electronic health records (EHRs) can improve healthcare. We will establish the processes and infrastructure necessary to disseminate clinical genetic testing, results reporting, and decision support into diverse hospital and EHR environments. This application focuses on pharmacogenomics, given the role of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as major causes of morbidity and mortality, the increasing number of recognized variants included in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels as mediators of both efficacy and toxicity, and the relative lack of stigma attached to carriers of variants in pharmacogenes. The project will build on two ongoing, clinical genotyping efforts at Vanderbilt: 1) the Pharmacogenomic Resource for Enhanced Decisions In Care and Treatment (PREDICT) program, which prospectively tests patients for 184 high-value germline pharmacogenomic variants including those associated with clopidogrel, warfarin and simvastatin; and 2) the Personal Cancer Medicine Initiative (PCMI), which routinely performs multiplex tumor gene mutation testing in lung cancer and melanoma to direct therapy. I3P will leverage the existing expertise, informatics, and laboratory infrastructure and resources at Vanderbilt to implement genomic medicine in three diverse healthcare systems at early adopter sites. These healthcare systems include underserved, minority populations (Nashville General Hospital at Meharry Medical College), military populations (Nashville Veterans Affairs Medical Center), and a community health system (Aurora Health Care)."
"9172618","DESCRIPTION:      Abstract Cervical spinal cord injury (C-SCI) is a common and frequently devastating battlefield injury that can result in a broad range of life-long locomotor, spasticity, and pain disabilities. Although SCI involves a cascade of numerous pathophysiological events that evolve over time, research aimed at therapy development has almost exclusively focused on single therapies which have failed in multicenter clinical trials to decrease physical assistance required for locomotion. Positive therapeutic benefits have been reported for locomotor therapy and, independently, for therapy utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to reduce disability in a variety of neurologic conditions. The proposed studies are designed to test the potential for the combination of locomotor training and TMS to produce convergent amplification of endogenous neuroplastic and repair mechanisms to significantly enhance locomotor recovery, and reduce spasticity, gait and pain disability. Spasticity is one of the more common complications of SCI for which new therapeutic avenues are continually being pursued. Multidisciplinary studies will quantitate therapeutic impact on disability, changes in underlying mechanisms, and provide comprehensive neurological and physiological safety assessments at acute and chronic therapeutic windows using a range of doses and combinations. Three complementary specific aims are proposed that are based upon supporting preliminary data and which will employ a battery of state of the art multi-organ systems monitoring, behavioral, neurophysiological, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular-based techniques that have been extensively employed in this laboratory. In this proposal we aim to: 1) compare the efficacy and safety of single pulse TMS of the spinal cord (SC) (TMSsc), and treadmill locomotor training (Tm), tested alone and in combination in acute C-SCI on the excitability of stretch reflexes, gait kinematics, pain sensitivity, and selected measures of physiological safety, 2) compare the efficacy of TMSsc and Tm locomotor training, tested alone and in combination in chronic C-SCI on spasticity, on gait kinematics and pain sensitivity, 3) identify key neurobiological processes (particularly, therapy induced up-regulation of specific signaling mechanisms) correlated with changes induced by injury and treatment in regard to spasticity, gait, and pain. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular expression of three factors that are essential for normal pattern of presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition: GABA/GABAb receptors and descending noradrenergic (NE) fiber projection. In addition, specific molecular markers for pain (GCH1, GTP cyclohydrolase 1; SP, Substance P; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide, a marker for pain and sprouting of SC afferents; Isolectin B4, IB4, marker for microglia) will be tested. Hypothesis: We propose that therapy induced normalization of spasticity measures will in part, be mediated by increased rate-dependent inhibition in the SC circuits, and these neurophysiological measures will correlate with significant up-regulation of immuno-expression of GABA/GABAb receptors and NE. We propose that therapy induced normalization of outcome measures for pain will correlate with reduced immune-expression of pain markers GCH1, SP, CGRP, and IB4. Translation of these findings and the demonstration of benefit from locomotor and TMSsc therapies could lead to more specific and potentially more effective locomotor therapy clinical trials in combat C-SCI patients which ultimately benefit the veterans' health care  system."
"9286810","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Neurodegenerative tauopathies are among the most common causes of dementia and parkinsonism in middle to late adult life. Diagnostic accuracy for tauopathies is reasonably good (over 75%) for some of these disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but poor (<50%) for others, such as corticobasal degeneration. Developing better biomarkers for these disorders would be useful for diagnosis, prognosis and future clinical trials. The genetic, cell modeling and immunoassays proposed by investigators in this CWOW address these important research objectives. The discovery of genetic variants that modulate risk and severity of tauopathy could provide significant insight into disease pathogenesis, as well as illuminate key pathways to target for potential therapeutics. Three genomic loci were reported in 2011 for the GWAS of PSP, including STX6, EIF2AK3, and MOBP, but the mechanisms by which each polymorphism impact disease risk remain unknown. Discovery of genetic factors that mediate sensitivity or resistance to tauopathy in Projects 1 and 2 will potentially necessitate development of novel resources to elucidate how each gene is functionally linked to tau deposition and toxicity in disease. Core C will generate new research tools to provide the Center with the means to uncover the underlying mechanisms for risk of disease mediated by the genetic variants, as well as identifying common pathways that potentially include multiple genetic modifiers and would thus represent ideal pathways to target therapeutically. In this Center, Core C plays an essential role through its large collection of pathologically-confirmed tauopathies and for provision of services to the research projects. In particular, we will provide biologic material from human tauopathy brains, as well as assist with the neuropathologic characterization and quantitation of tau burden in humans and mice. We will also validate the relationship between tau pathology and key discoveries by project investigators. Finally, we will establish novel assays to provide mechanistic insight into the link between genetic modifiers and disease."

"9211747","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT International travel may not only increase the risk of infection for an individual traveler, but may also contribute to the global spread of infections. A better understanding of this epidemiologically important population could lead to improved interventions (1) to promote the health of international travelers, and (2) to diminish the spread of infections within home communities. This application focuses on proposed efforts for the Global Travelers' Epidemiology Network (Global TravEpiNet; GTEN). GTEN's mission is to lessen illness among high-risk international travelers, including VFR travelers, and to reduce the likelihood of disease importation into the United States. GTEN is comprised of two components: (1) a consortium of over 20 clinical sites that collects real-time data on pre-travel health care provided across the United States (since inception: over 80,000 records have been collected), and (2) a public health outreach program (?Heading Home Healthy?; www.headinghomehealthy.org) that includes web-tools and educational materials in multiple languages for high risk and VFR travelers, as well as a clinical guidance tool for non-expert providers who deliver the majority of pre-travel care to such travelers. We propose to expand upon the existing infrastructure developed by GTEN in order to (1) answer fundamental questions relating to the health care of US residents who travel internationally, and (2) improve the pre-travel health care provided to vulnerable US populations at highest risk of travel-related illness."
"9168198","Project Summary  Why do some cells become malignant while most others do not? Can the cell-of-origin for cancer be identified based on specific features? How do we conceptualize such specific features within the framework of cancer biology? This proposal aims to provide answers for these questions. There are two prevailing, non- exclusive models to explain how cancers arise. One is that full transformation requires accumulation of multiple genetic mutations so that malignancy occurs only when all mutations have been acquired. The other is that mutations in rare stem cells cause malignancy. Recent technologic development has brought about contradicting evidence that is difficult for either of these models to explain, demanding a new conceptual framework to account for how malignancy is initiated. My previous work in tracking how somatic cells change their fate into pluripotent stem cells demonstrated that the epigenome responds to genetic insults differently when cell cycle is greatly accelerated. Based on this discovery, I propose a third model for how malignancy arises from normal cells: a transiently ultrafast cycling cell provides oncogenes with a permissive epigenetic context to induce malignancy. This hypothesis will be tested primarily using the hematopoietic system, in which the linage relationship, surface phenotype and cell cycle behaviors have all been well charted. The oncogene of choice is MLL-AF9, a fusion oncogene involved in human acute myeloid leukemia, which requires chromatin binding to initiate malignancy. We have established novel experimental approaches and obtained preliminary data that support malignant transformation is initiated from the fastest cycling hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. Because cancer is a disease in vivo, experimental strategies to vigorously define the cancer cell-of-origin in vivo are presented. New mouse models that will enable the visualization and measurement of cell cycle speed of leukemia initiating cells in vivo under homeostasis will be generated. Following our preliminary data supporting that ultrafast cycling cells display more accessible chromatin, we will formally test whether fast cell cycle promotes transformation by providing oncogenes with a more permissive chromatin context using genomic, genetic and imaging approaches. Finally, the generalizability of the central hypothesis will be tested using additional oncogenes and in solid tumor systems. Since the ultrafast cycling state could arise transiently in developmental, physiological, pathological or therapeutic conditions, this model makes a number of important predictions that can and will be experimentally tested. I anticipate to demonstrate that cell cycle acceleration fuels transformation not by generating more mutations, but by creating a more permissive chromatin context for oncogenic transcription factors to establish malignant gene expression programs. Overall, I aim to reveal a new logic for how oncogenes act and co-operate to induce malignancy, and to provide a fundamentally different perception for cancer initiation and intervention. The Director's New Innovator Award is the only support mechanism that can make achieving this goal possible."

"9249777","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Makadzange, Azure Tariro In 2014 UNAIDS set ambitious goals to achieve 90% virologic suppression rates among individuals on ART. In Zimbabwe this is an ambitious target particularly among adolescents; <5% of HIV infected individuals received HIV viral load (VL) testing in 2015 and treatment failure rates among adolescents range between 35-42%. Adolescents failing ART also have high rates of drug resistance. Scalable strategies to facilitate improved VL monitoring, adherence support and genotyping for those with persistent viremia are urgently needed. We have shown that dried blood spot (DBS) samples can be used for routine VL monitoring on existing technologies. We have also adapted an evidence based, widely used, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) adherence intervention (Life-Steps) for use in Zimbabwe and have identified a low-cost genotyping strategy that can facilitate detection of drug resistance mutations using already existing RT-PCR technology. We hypothesize that our proposed package of care will result in a decrease in virologic failure rates among adolescents. Our primary study objective is to determine if implementation of a package of care that includes DBS based viral load monitoring, coupled with an evidence-based intervention to improve ART adherence using cognitive- behavioral principles and genotyping for those with persistent viremia decreases 12-month virologic failure rates among HIV-infected adolescents compared with standard of care. We will also adapt and integrate Nzira Itsva for Adolescents (NI), a cultural adaptation of Life-Steps into routine care as an adherence support intervention for HIV infected adolescents, and implement a novel low-cost genotyping assay using Pan Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA) of viral RNA as a point mutation assay for the detection of drug resistance. Process and cost data will be collected for subsequent cost-analysis. The proposed intervention will be a two-arm cluster-randomized trial in Mashonaland West and Matabeleland North provinces of Zimbabwe. The units of randomization will be public and largely rural clinics within the provinces, with sites randomized to the intervention or to the standard of care. The study is anticipated to show that the use of DBS in routine monitoring of adolescents is feasible, to show that CBT if incorporated into routine counseling activities can complement viral load monitoring and genotyping to reduce treatment failure rates and preserve therapeutic options for infected adolescents. The results of this study will have important implications in Zimbabwe and other low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a large proportion of HIV infected adolescents. The study will include young adolescents 10-14 years, as well as older adolescents 14-19 years and therefore provide data that will guide implementation of strategies for virologic success in the growing number of children who are surviving on ART into adolescents, as well as for behaviorally infected adolescents.

"9137612","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In September 2010, New York became the fourth state to perform newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) by quantifying T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). There are several types of SCID, which are caused by mutations in many different genes, but have a common feature of low or absent functional T-cells. TRECs are a unique DNA byproduct formed during the normal process of T-cell production. TREC quantification can be used for SCID newborn screening because low or absent TRECs may be indicative of an underlying T-cell deficiency, including SCID and other immune disorders. The validity of the TREC assay for identifying infants with classic SCID has been well established. However, the feasibility and usefulness of a second tier next generation sequencing assay has not been studied. After obtaining informed consent, the goals of this project include identification of the specific genes and mutations in infants with low TRECs, tracking their clinical outcomes and developing materials for patient education. Mutation analysis of several genes that are known to cause SCID will be performed using two next generation sequencing platforms. Patient data will be collected to determine whether the genotype data is important for the diagnosis, genetic counseling and resulting clinical care of infants being evaluated for SCID. The outreach and education component of this project will include organizing a group of parents whose infants screened positive for SCID, and using their unique perspective to create educational resources. This project is relevant on a national level because states continue to add TREC analysis to their newborn screening panels. At the conclusion of this project, a model for other states to perform cost- effective gene analysis will be presented. The project will also enable collection of quality assurance specimens to assist the CDC in its goal to provide states with materials for test development and ongoing quality assurance and quality improvement."
"9282177","ABSTRACT Converging evidence documents moderate to high rates of sexual violence against youth. The 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a national survey of students in grades 9-12, found a lifetime reported prevalence for unwanted physically forced sexual intercourse of 11.8% for girls and 4.5% for boys (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). In addition, physical or verbal sexual harassment is extremely common in schools among adolescents, with one national study reporting that 57% of boys and 50% of girls reported sexually harassing a peer. Despite the importance of this public health problem, sexual violence prevention has a limited evidence base. Equally challenging, most school-based anti-violence programs have focused on individual types of aggression, typically physical aggression occurring within relationships (Leff, Power, Manz, Costigan, & Nabors, 2001). At present few programs systematically address broader social-ecological factors such as school-wide norms and youth-adult connectedness that research identifies as major drivers of SV (Basile, Espelage, Rivers, McMahon, & Simon, 2009). To address this gap, this application proposes a large- scale RCT evaluation of Sources of Strength to evaluate for sexual violence perpetration outcomes. Sources of Strength is an evidence based program for youth suicide that trains student key leaders to strengthen social connectedness and healthy norms school-wide (Wyman et al., 2010) and is listed on the National Registry of Evidence Based Programs and Practices (NREPP). This project will expand the existing evidence base by evaluating Sources of Strength for sexual violence outcomes, which has never been done before. Twenty-four high schools will be recruited and stratified (rural or urban) and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) immediate Sources of Strength intervention, (b) wait-list for Sources of Strength Implementation after 16 months. A representative sample of each school (grades 9-11, in total n = 7200) will be enrolled for repeated longitudinal assessment to assess SoS impact as well as moderators and mediators of its efficacy. The intervention will be rolled out between spring 2017 and spring 2020 with cohorts receiving the intervention for 16 months and completing a total of four assessments. This study is highly innovative and could have substantial public health impact by targeting shared risk and protective factors to demonstrate impact on multiple forms of violence. This approach builds on the call to evaluate `cross over' effective of preventive interventions (Reider & Sims, 2016) in order to identify common prevention pathways to multiple health behavior problems. A strength of our proposed study is measurement of factors across student (behaviors, attitudes, norms), interpersonal (peer social networks), and school-level (school climate based on aggregate school staff reports).  "

"9139878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) has profound implications for clinicians - they are expected to adopt and actively utilize electronic health records (EHRs), or be subject to financial penalties. One month after ARRA was signed, however, the National Research Council (NRC) concluded that the nationwide deployment of EHRs called for by ARRA might set back 21st century healthcare goals. The central conclusion of the NRC report was that current EHRs do not provide cognitive support for health care clinicians. Further, if clinician cognitive work is not supported, patient care and outcomes suffer. The latest research on EHRs suggests slow but increasing adoption rates, mixed results regarding quality of care and safety improvement, no reduction in costs of care, and physician dissatisfaction with EHR use. We propose that issues related to failed EHR achievement can be overcome by designing EHRs which support the cognitive work of clinicians. This premise is consistent with conclusions from the 2009 NRC report and two October 2009 AHRQ-funded reports calling for AHRQ to fund research on the relationships between clinician cognitive work and EHRs. This application takes up that challenge. Our long-term goal is to develop new EHR interfaces (data displays and input requirements), implementable by vendors and/or information technology programmers, that are demonstrated to support and extend clinician and team cognitive work to improve patient outcomes. This application takes the first step toward our long-term goal. Our Specific Aims are to (1) identify the cognitive work requirements of primary care clinicians and their clinical teams, and (2) develop and test specific EHR interface design requirements that support these cognitive work requirements. We choose to focus our research on primary care because of its high utilization, high complexity, and the current national efforts to redesign it following the patient-centered medical home model. Due to the cognitive complexity of primary care, we will employ a method designed to study cognitively complex work: cognitive task analysis (CTA). CTA methods are well-developed, and have been used to determine cognitive work requirements and develop information technologies that support this cognitive work in other complex domains such as aviation, nuclear power, NASA - and recently - healthcare. Using a specific CTA method called Goal-Directed Task Analysis, we will map the cognitive requirements of clinicians and clinician teams to EHR interface design. Our experienced research team comprised of experts in human factors engineering, health information technology, and primary care, has an 11-year history of collaboration and is uniquely positioned to complete this important endeavor. This application builds on the successes of our team's three recent AHRQ-funded primary care patient safety studies, and continues our productive partnership with Wisconsin's Practice-Based Research Network, to recruit clinics and clinicians."
"9142281","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Investigators propose a multi-phase research, development and dissemination program to mitigate alarm fatigue and advance bedside clinical informatics through integration of human factors engineering and an open medical device-interface approach for hardware-level signals acquisition, multi-parametric algorithmic analyses and effective delivery of intelligent alerts to clinical providers. The emphasis on meaningful use in healthcare has led to unprecedented expenditures to bring medicine online.1 Yet the absence of a commensurate surge in true interoperability, open architectures and lay- developer access into medical devices and healthcare information technology is likely contributing to reported failures of these initiatives to improve patient care.2-8 Within this context, it is truly telling that one of the high- profile issues in healthcare, i.e., alarm fatigue, features bedside patient monitor systems as an exemplar of the problematic siloed design paradigm commonly found in medical technologies. As alarm fatigue affects the safety of all patients exposed to healthcare devices and systems that alarm, the study team proposes a non- proprietary approach to improve bedside monitor telemetry systems.9 Specifically, the Push Electronic Relay of Smart Alarms for End User Situational Awareness (PERSEUS) program is an integrative research and development proposal to study experimental alarm fatigue mitigation measures. As a precisely-defined and clinically based proof-of-concept initiative, the program is defined by its origins in the sharp end of healthcare delivery, explicit scope and deliverables, and a primary focus on real-world utility and patient safety impact. Investigators propose to combine the results of preliminary work (previous human factors engineering site intervention; non-commercial hardware and software prototypes) with continued HFE analyses and biomedical engineering efforts to experimentally augment existing monitor systems. The intervention will be designed to 1.) Directly access patient physiologic datastreams from monitors, 2.) Process acquired signals with multi- parametric algorithms to generate intelligent alerts, and 3.) Effectively communicate the derived high-impact information with targeted push messaging to specified clinical providers. In effect, the program's experimental intervention will work to supersede [threshold-alarm-broadcast] mechanisms with a [thresholds-processing- information-targeting-delivery] approach. Structured use-testing of the experimentally-modified patient monitor telemetry system and comparative assessment relative to base system will be conducted in a busy, high-acuity Emergency Department; proven arrhythmia-on-telemetry simulations and longitudinal tracer patient observations for outcome metrics that signify translational benefit (e.g., serious cardiopulmonary events and therapeutic interventions in real patients) will be used. The hardware and software developed to implement the experimental intervention will be compiled into a program deliverable as an open research toolbox for extramural investigations on legacy and new medical devices, with test dissemination at a sister site ED."
"9205021","Although most health care occurs in ambulatory settings, how best to implement patient safety in primary care is not well understood. Key ambulatory safety domains include missed diagnoses, delays in proper treatment, medication errors and preventable adverse drug events and defects in communication, information flow, and care coordination. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), a key model for improving primary care, is designed to address core attributes of comprehensive, patient-centered, coordinated, and accessible care and quality and safety. No previous research has explicitly evaluated safety in the PCMH. This partnership between Johns Hopkins and the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) is a unique opportunity to evaluate how the PCMH can best address safety. Both organizations have significant experience with building and evaluating the PCMH; NCQA, as the US PCMH accreditor, has extensive data and links to the PCMH community, which has expressed strong interest in this project. The Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality brings extensive expertise in all aspects of patient safety, particularly critical areas such as safety culture and human factors. Our overall goal is to improve ambulatory safety by evaluating the meaning and implementation of safety in PCMHs. In this mixed-methods study, we will evaluate how primary care practices (using the best-case scenario of Level 3 PCMHs) are addressing ambulatory safety across the four key domains through data from multiple perspectives, including patient input. Our specific aims are: (1) Using data on practices that have achieved NCQA recognition and providers that have participated in electronic health record meaningful use reporting, explore trends and variation in adoption of patient safety activities based on practice and regional characteristics; (2) using triangulated data from interviews, observation, and patient focus groups, analyze how the PCMH model interacts with patient safety from different perspectives-patient, provider, and administrator - across the four key ambulatory safety domains; and (3) in a sample of practices implementing the PCMH in diverse ways, evaluate the association of contextual issues (eg, practice type) and specific PCMH implementation practices with patient safety measures across the four key domains of ambulatory safety using qualitative comparative analysis. The expected outcomes will be important findings about how the PCMH and specific implementation elements interact with patient safety and potentially impact safety outcomes, across diverse ambulatory safety domains and PCMH programs. The results will inform public and private sector efforts to advance ambulatory safety, provide critical information on viability of various methods for evaluating ambulatory safety outcomes and suggest ways to better integrate safety into models such as the PCMH. Findings will be disseminated through NCQA standards and PCMH community partners and will improve knowledge about ambulatory safety and how best to design future interventions to improve patient outcomes."
"9125658","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disability and public health remain an elusive combination despite obvious synergies. Birth defects, developmental and other disabilities, health and care disparities in disability, and health and wellness for people with disabilities are not commonly noted in medical and health education and service programs. This proposal is designed to develop a Center to focus a program of activities in support of the initiative and mandates of the NCBDDD, called the Disability Research and Dissemination Center (DRDC). DRDC will require a collaborative that includes prominent organizations, networks, and groups with the capacity to carry out public health research, training, and practice in the areas of birth defects, developmental and other disabilities; avoid health disparities for people with disabilitie of all ages; and promote health and development of persons with disabilities across the lifespan. DRDC will be organized through 5 Cores: 1) Administration to provide infrastructure and coordination for Center activities; 2) Research to support NCBDD priorities and those of the Center; 3) Training and Evidence-Based Programs to catalogue/promote evidence-based practices for wellness and develop professionals' education; 4) Dissemination to advance information with and for stakeholders and others; 5) Evaluation to assess processes of the Center and assure research and product integrity. The collaborative will bring together nationally prominent disability experts in pediatrics, rehabilitation medicine, preventive medicine and public health, behavioral health, genetics, epidemiology and biostatistics, health promotion, nursing, social work and related fields who are located within universities, schools of public health and medical schools throughout the US. The organizational framework allows us to be inclusive of medical and health education programs and tenure track faculty in university settings, plus colleagues in public and private organizations and businesses, who have expertise in research and training to promote the health of people with developmental and other disabilities. Our primary team and Cores will be housed at University of South Carolina (Columbia, SC), SUNY Upstate Medical University (Syracuse, NY), and American Association on Health and Disability (Washington, DC). The primary team has successfully worked together to establish and expand the field specific journal, Disability and Health Journal."
"9272117","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has established a pediatric biorepository with over 60,000 children consented for access to electronic health records (EHRs) with regular updates, re-contact, and high-density genome-wide association (GWA) array data. For this project, we have proposed five specific aims reflecting the workgroup mechanism of the eMERGE consortium. These will build upon substantive Preliminary Data derived during eMERGE II, where a series of GWA, sequencing, pharmacogenomics (PGx), EHR integration, and return-of-results (RoR) projects helped establish a platform for translational and eMERGE III efforts. In the first of these aims, we propose to continue to expand the eMERGE phenotype library and we propose four lead phenotypes: obesity, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism, in which we have a strong record in discovery, integration, and translation. Under specific aim 2, we propose to leverage CAG's position as a world-leader in genomics research to characterize rare variants in 2,000 CAG patients, where we have already catalogued several hundred rare variants in the accompanying Appendix. Leveraging this resource and expertise at CAG and eMERGE, we propose to return actionable findings to a minimum of ~160 parents (Specific Aim 3). This effort will build upon our existing RoR platform established during eMERGE II that returned results to parents of 160 CHOP children with autism, and to several hundred individuals with PGx risk profiles. Our fourth aim is to evaluate the health impact, cost-effectiveness and ELSI implications of RoR, and we aim to longitudinally track all families to whom results are returned at four time-points, leveraging existing resources and surveys developed with pediatric eMERGE partners. Finally, we propose a massive expansion of our EHR integration, established under eMERGE II, which also provide and integrate education resources for patients and medical professionals across the eMERGE network. Ultimately, we anticipate that the immediate outcome of these efforts will be improved healthcare for patients at CHOP and expanding to the entire eMERGE network. Further, with our eMERGE partners, we aim to establish a blueprint for integrating genomics and EHR data on such a scale that it will have real potential to fundamentally change medical practice in the US."
"9317038","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The counter balancing of pro- and anti-inflammatory gene transcription is crucial for normal homeostasis after inflammatory lung injury induced by environmental toxicants and inflammatory agents. An aberrant regulation of this balance in the lung culminates in an unchecked inflammation and a failure to resolve tissue damage. Studies in this competing renewal will test the hypothesis that persistent inflammatory lung injury is the result of a shift within phagocytic cells in the balance between two crucial redox regulatory proteins, Fra-1/AP-1 and Nrf2. These transcription factors bind to DNA after heterodimerization with other binding partners and thereby regulate gene expression. During the previous grant-funding period, we showed that Fra-1 functioned as a crucial negative regulator of Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective gene expression containing the Nrf2-binding Anti- oxidant Response Element (ARE), often embedded with Fra-1/AP-1 binding sites. Fra-1 null mice are resistant to endotoxin-induced mortality and exhibit reduced levels of lung inflammation and injury and accelerated resolution of inflammation compared to wild-type mice. Endotoxin (LPS)-induced expression of Fra-1 largely occurs in alveolar macrophages, and in human lungs infected with E. coli ex vivo. Importantly, mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Fra-1 showed greater protection against endotoxin-induced mortality than wild-type mice. In preliminary mechanistic studies, we found reduced levels of endotoxin-induced NF-?B activation in Fra-1-deficient macrophages and an increased expression of TNFAIP3 (aka A20), a crucial bipartite ubiquitin-editing enzyme required for terminating uncontrolled activation of NF-?B, a crucial factor that regulates inflammation. Nrf2-deficient macrophages showed the opposite effects. These findings laid the foundation for the central concept in this project that Fra-1/Nrf2-balanced reciprocal signaling is essential for the resolution of lung injury mediated by ubiquitin-editing protein A20, essential for blunting inflammatory responses mediated by pro-inflammatory NF-KB. Additionally, we will address a novel concept that suppressing the function of Fra-1 while at the same time activating Nrf2 may be required for sustaining the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of Nrf2, and accelerating resolution of lung injury. We will use multiple mechanistic approaches and tissue-specific knockout mouse models to test this hypothesis. Our specific objectives are: 1) To determine the mechanisms of the balance of Fra-1/Nrf2 reciprocal signaling in the regulation of endotoxin-induced A20 expression in lung macrophages, 2) To elucidate the pro-inflammatory role of myeloid-specific Fra-1 in the regulation of lung injury through the modulation of Nrf2-mediated A20 expression, and 3) To investigate the dual strategy of inactivating Fra-1 and concomitantly activating Nrf2 to accelerate resolution of inflammatory lung injury. The proposed studies will define whether a Fra-1 and Nrf2 imbalance is a causative factor in aberrant resolution of inflammatory lung injury and repair processes, and will lay the framework for drug development favoring resolution of inflammatory lung injury."
"9152183","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky alcohol use is a major health concern among college students, with 40.1% reporting binge drinking (5 or more drinks in one occasion) and 14.4% reporting heavy drinking (binge drinking on 5 or more occasions) in the past month. Risky alcohol use is thought to be the result of a complex interplay between genes, biological processes, and other phenotypic characteristics. This is further complicated by the phenotypic heterogeneity in the development of alcohol use. Developmental studies have suggested two pathways to risky alcohol use, characterized by externalizing and internalizing characteristics, respectively. However, the underlying biological processes that differentiate these pathways are not fully understood, thereby contributing to the difficulty developing efficacious treatments. Without knowledge of the underlying biology, personalized pharmacological interventions and therapeutic treatments will not be possible. Neuroimaging studies have assessed reward sensitivity, emotion reactivity, and behavioral inhibition using fMRI and separately demonstrate associations in externalizing and internalizing subtypes. In addition, previous genetic studies have found associations between specific polymorphisms and these externalizing and internalizing subtypes. Finally, brain activation patterns have been shown to be a heritable trait themselves. Therefore, we hypothesize that externalizing and internalizing binge drinkers are characterized by biological differences (at the brain and genome levels) and differences in brain activation will mediate the effect of genetic variation on the phenotypic characteristics. We will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) determine the genetic relationship between externalizing and internalizing characteristics in binge drinkers, 2) test whether externalizing and internalizing binge drinkers show differences in brain activation in response to tasks measuring emotion reactivity, reward sensitivity, and behavioral inhibition and 3) test whether brain activation mediates the relationship between genetic risk and externalizing/internalizing characteristics. In order to achieve these Aims, we will use a large (N~7,500) genotyped young adult sample (NIAAA-R37 AA011408, PI Kenneth Kendler) to conduct a series of genotypic analyses assessing differences in common variants, genetic pathways, gene networks, and rare variants between the externalizing and internalizing subtypes. In a subset of these binge drinking young adults (N=60), brain activation will be measured on tasks assessing behavioral inhibition, reward sensitivity, and emotion reactivity. Finally, we will test whether variation in brain activation on these tasks mediates the relationshi between genetic risk and externalizing/internalizing characteristics in binge drinkers. The findings of this project will provide solid groundwork to better understand the underlying biology between the classic externalizing and internalizing alcohol use subtypes. This knowledge of the underlying biology has the potential to elucidate new subtype specific targets for prevention and intervention, a major initiative of the NIAAA."
"9159799","SUMMARY Our scientific objective is to understand how proteins modulate the function of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) enzymes through structural changes to their associated catalytic RNA. This goal is highly relevant to public health due to the growing appreciation for the roles of RNPs in tissue complexity and human diseases. In this proposal, we will use RNase P as a model to test our postulate that the versatility of RNPs is due to protein- mediated structural changes in their RNA cores. Although the primary function of RNase P is 5??-maturation of precursor tRNAs, recent findings suggest an expanded functional mission that includes biogenesis of eukaryotic non-coding RNAs. Eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P consist of a catalytic RPR (RNase P RNA) and multiple (4-10) RPPs (RNase P Proteins), unlike the simpler bacterial version (1 RPR + 1 RPP). Because all RPRs are active on their own in vitro, the need for multiple archaeal and eukaryotic RPPs is unclear. We found from step-wise reconstitutions of archaeal RNase P that its assembly intermediates comprising partial suites of five RPPs and the RPR exhibit activity and fidelity of processing in between the RPR alone or the full holo- enzyme (RPR + all RPPs). These findings motivate our central hypothesis that binding of RPPs to specific RPR regions independently and collectively mediates RNA structural changes essential for assembly and catalysis. We will address this hypothesis with two specific aims to delineate structure-function relationships of intermediates en route to assembly of the full RNP: (1) Dissect the structural basis for the distinct roles of archaeal RPPs in aiding RPR catalysis, and (2) map the assembly landscape of archaeal RPPs on the RPR. To study how RPPs guide the RPR towards its functional state, we propose an innovative combination of site- specific and global structural methods coupled to direct functional readouts. In Aim 1, we will probe archaeal RPR structural changes induced by different suites of RPPs at nucleotide resolution using SHAPE-Seq (selective 2??-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing), a high throughput method to probe RNA structures. Inferences from SHAPE-Seq, linking structural changes to functional outcomes, will be guided by the RNA-protein contact sites obtained from tethered-nuclease mapping and validated using assays of RPR mutants. In Aim 2, we will survey the hierarchy and cooperation during RNase P assembly with bulk and single molecule fluorescence kinetic studies. RPP-mediated alterations in RPR conformational sampling will be studied using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and changes in RPR topology will be uncovered with small angle x-ray scattering and native mass spectrometry. Although activity versus fidelity tradeoffs have shaped the adaptive landscape of many enzymes, we expect our work to provide insights into how multiple RPPs allowed archaeal/eukaryotic RNase P to maintain robust cleavage without compromising processing fidelity on a broad range of substrates. This study will contribute to a framework for understanding the mechanistic basis of RNA-protein cooperation in RNPs and how dysfunctioning RNPs lead to disease."
"9259437","Prescription opioid misuse is a public health threat that is being addressed with heightened urgency at both clinical and policy levels. In primary care settings, where chronic pain is commonly treated with long-term opioid therapy, as many as one-in-three chronic pain patients misuse opioids, evidenced by aberrant drug- related behaviors such as dose escalation or use of opioids to self-medicate negative emotions. According to a 2015 NIH-AHRQ systematic review of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain (Chou et al., 2015), research on risk mitigation strategies for opioid misuse among chronic pain patients is virtually nonexistent. Extant therapies for opioid misuse and chronic pain may have limited efficacy because they fail to directly target the maladaptive emotion-cognition interactions and hedonic dysregulation inherent in these co-occurring problems. To meet this need, the PI developed a novel behavioral intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE). MORE is innovative in that it aims to modify associative learning mechanisms hijacked during the allostatic process of opioid misuse by strengthening top-down cognitive control to restructure bottom-up reward learning from valuation of drug reward to natural reward ? something that no other behavioral intervention for opioid misuse has been designed to do. The goal of the proposed study is to conduct a full-scale RCT of MORE to reduce aberrant drug-related behaviors and chronic pain among opioid misusing patients in primary care. Participants will be randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or a conventional support group control. Patient-reported outcomes will be assessed pre- to post-treatment and through a 9- month follow-up; this data will be triangulated through physician evaluation, urine toxicology, and medical records. Design features of this hybrid study draw upon complementary strengths of Stage II and Stage III research as defined by the NIH Stage Model (Onken et al., 2014) maximizing internal validity, intervention potency, and fidelity assurance with research therapists while maximizing external validity by administering the intervention in community clinics ? the setting where the majority of chronic pain patients seek health care. The proposed project will elucidate cognitive, affective, and autonomic mechanisms mediating the therapeutic effect of MORE on aberrant drug-related behavior and pain, and will examine psychiatric and psychophysiological moderators and predictors of treatment response ? including an innovative biomarker representing the relative salience of drug and natural reward. Ecological momentary assessments of pain, craving, and affective states will be correlated with opioid dosing data and therapeutic skill practice to reveal how MORE modulates symptoms and opioid misuse in everyday life. This translational research proposal from a New Investigator could significantly reshape the treatment of prescription opioid misuse among chronic pain patients by targeting top-down and bottom-up mechanisms underlying these intersecting issues and advancing evidence-based integration of behavioral health into primary care."
"9217838","PROJECT SUMMARY: In its recently released report, Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted that most individuals will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastating consequences. Compared to other healthcare settings, clinicians working in emergency departments (EDs) are particularly vulnerable to making diagnostic errors due to time-pressured decision-making in a busy and often chaotic environment. In addition to this, provision of emergency care to children is complicated by their unique needs such as weight-based dosing of medications, their inability to verbalize their symptoms and often, their dependence on parents/guardians even for accessing healthcare. There are approximately 25 million annual pediatric ED visits in the United States. A conservative estimate of 5% prevalence, translates into ~ 1.25 million potential annual cases of diagnostic errors in the pediatric ED. To date, there has been no systematic research on diagnostic errors in the pediatric emergencies. Diagnostic errors, when defined as the inability to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on available evidence (i.e. missed opportunities for improving diagnosis or MOIDs), have been investigated in adult, outpatient settings. Members of our research team have used electronic health record based triggers to detect MOIDs and study the factors that cause diagnostic errors. Our long-term goal is to better understand MOIDs in pediatric EDs to ultimately decrease their prevalence. To accomplish that, in this project, we will assemble a multidisciplinary panel of experts in diagnostic decision making, pediatric emergency medicine along with patient/family advisory boards to develop a pediatric ED relevant model to identify triggers and subsequently use them to measure the frequency as well as contributing factors of diagnostic errors in four pediatric EDs. Our project is significant, innovative, and timely because it will lay the foundation for development of error detection tools that can be used to provide timely feedback to clinicians, track institutional or clinician performance, and measure impact of error mitigation strategies."
"9329957","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), a distinct type of bone marrow-derived cell, play an important role in linking innate and adaptive immune responses. pDC are pivotal in the first line of defense against viral infections through recognitio of viruses by toll-like receptors as well as their ability to produce large amounts of type I interferons (IFN). In preliminary studies, we have discovered a novel population of resident pDC in the cornea. In vivo pDC depletion in our preliminary studies demonstrate that pDC are the major source of IFN-a in the cornea and play a protective role in the host defense in herpes simplex keratitis (HSK). Thus our results suggest that pDC are key participants in fighting viral keratitis, while preserving vision. Identifying specific functions of pDC in HSK and understanding the critical pathways of pDC and T cell migration in the cornea may provide new molecular targets for pharmacological intervention through immunotherapy. However, defining organ- and cell-specific molecular migratory mechanisms is critical, in order to inhibit cell subsets driving disease, without affecting leukocytes required for protective immunity. To address these questions, we have developed a new multiphoton intravital microscopy (MP-IVM) model to study pDC in intact corneas of living mice. This imaging approach uses transgenic mice, with fluorescent pDC, and fluorescent viruses, and will visualize pDC and viruses at subcellular resolution in living animals, allowing us to study their interaction with surrounding cells. Based on preliminary work and that up-regulation of organ-specific combination of vascular adhesion molecules and chemokines regulate pDC and T cell recruitment to the cornea and subsequent migration of pDC from the cornea in inflammation and infection. We further hypothesize that pDC are protective to the cornea in HSK through local corneal IFN-? and TNF-? production and migrate to distinct areas of the dLN after activation in HSK, where they mediate differentiation pathways of CD4+ T cells to T regulatory or T helper (Th)17 cells through IFN-? and IL-6 production. pDC will be studied to investigate the traffic signals that guide them to normal and inflamed corneas and will be used to address the following two specific aims: 1.) To characterize corneal pDC and dissect the molecular mechanisms that mediate their recruitment and egress during inflammation; 2.) To characterize corneal pDC and dissect the molecular mechanisms that mediate their recruitment and egress during inflammation. Identification of these critical pathways of cell migration to and from the cornea will provide new and highly specific molecular targets for pharmacological intervention in inflammatory, infectious, alloimmune and autoimmune diseases. Few effective anti-inflammatory drugs have emerged over the last decades in the ophthalmic field and an urgent need for new drugs exists. HSK is a leading cause of blindness. Effective therapy for HSK would significantly reduce visual impairment, increase productivity, and reduce the burden of treating HSK."
"9205447","TITLE: Therapeutic repurposing of benserazide for colon cancer ABSTRACT: We have recently identified cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an endogenous tumor-promoting factor and thus a potential new therapeutic target in colorectal cancer. The importance of CBS-derived H2S in the pathobiology of colorectal cancer is supported by: 1) the significant anti- tumorigenic effects of CBS gene silencing, and 2) induction of an invasive metastatic phenotype when aberrantly overexpressed. Also, treatment with the prototypical CBS inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) reduces colon cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. However, the potency, specificity and selectivity of AOAA is suboptimal. Moreover, no clinically used, professional CBS inhibitors exist. To facilitate the translation of CBS inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics, via the repurposing route, we have conducted a virtual screening 260,000 compounds, with special emphasis of (a) commonalities in the emerging structures and (b) potential availability of the identified compounds for rapid repurposing. The virtual screening was conducted using a combination of publicly available software. The results produced several common scaffolds, one of them being a class of compounds which also included benserazide, a clinically used anti- Parkinson compound with its original pharmacological action of being a peripherally acting DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor. We have tested benserazide in vitro on human recombinant CBS, and confirmed it CBS inhibitory activity. In order to begin clinical translation of the compounds into the direction of anticancer effects, we have also tested its effect in HCT116 cells, a human colon cancer line. The compound caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of HCT116 proliferation. We have also conducted Pubmed searches and have compared the antiproliferative concentration range of benserazide with the concentration range of the compound in patients; have done pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling using publicly available software (Winnonlin) to estimate the concentrations of benserazide likely achievable in the tumor tissue of patients. Taken together, these data suggest that benserazide, after an appropriately selected set of preclinical studies proposed in the current application, may be a candidate for repurposing for the clinical therapy of colon cancer. Aim 1 will focus on hit validation and repurposing feasibility testing in vitro. Aim 2 will focus on ?hit? validation in vivo. Completion of the proposed project is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of benserazide as an anticancer agent, and is expected to build preclinical rationale for the repurposing of benserazide for the experimental therapy of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The applicant team has all necessary theoretical and practical expertise to conduct the proposed work."

"9141337","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Osteoclasts (OC) are key mediators of erosive bone diseases, including tumor-associated osteolytic lesions, as well as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other forms of arthritis, and osteoporosis. Indeed, OC are the only cells known to degrade bone. Osteoclastogenesis begins with differentiation of monocytes into OC precursor cells (OCP), which subsequently differentiate into multinucleated OC with bone resorption activity (Chiu, 2012). Studies with antibodies (Mensah, 2010) and knock-out/in models (Yagi, 2005) demonstrate an absolute requirement for the Dendritic Cell-Specific TrAnsMembrane Protein (DC-STAMP) for the fusion of OCP to generate fully active OC. Anti-DC-STAMP monoclonal antibodies attenuate the fusogenic process, reducing the number of active OC (Mensah, 2010) thus providing a unique approach to erosive bone diseases. Our Phase 1 goal is to identify and characterize a human monoclonal anti-DC-STAMP antibody (humAb) as a therapy for erosive bone diseases. We will construct a panel of humanized versions of DC-STAMP-specific mouse mAb 1A2, then express, purify, and characterize the candidate humAbs to be rank-ordered using an in vitro assays of binding, and osteoclastogenesis. The functional activity of the top anti-DC-STAMP humAb will then be evaluated in a mouse model to explore application for multiple myeloma-associated bone erosion. Successful identification of a DC-STAMP humAb will merit submission of a Phase 2 application to fund IND- enabling studies."
"9073486","Project 4  Project Summary Abstract   Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) reprograms cells upon infection. This reprogramming  of cell fate furthers lytic viral replication and latent genome persistence. One other outcome of this  reprogramming is cellular transformation, such that KSHV-infected cells give rise to human cancer. KSHV  reprograms endothelial cells to adopt a lymphatic phenotype, as opposed to a vascular phenotype. KSHV  induces hyperplasia of these lymphatic endothelial cells. This eventually leads to complete transformation  and the emergence of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). KSHV reprograms B cells, though it is unclear exactly which  subset and what the direct outcome is. Eventually this, too, leads to complete transformation and the  emergence of signature, KSHV-associated, B cell malignancies, i.e. a subclass of multicentric Castleman's  disease (MCD) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). We hypothesize that this reprogramming is  mediated, at least in part, by viral microRNAs, some of which are secreted in the form of vesicles. We will  investigate the function of the viral microRNAs either within the cell or circulating in blood (exosome) in  culture and in mouse models."
"9264927","In response to the RFA-NS-16-021 to address some of the gaps in our knowledge of the biologic mechanisms of the commonly occurring cerebrovascular disease and age-related white matter (WM) disease at the molecular, cellular and brain circuit level, we propose to study the role of pericytes in WM disease using new pericyte-specific animal models and advanced molecular, cellular and neuroimaging methods, and circuit level analysis. Up to 45% of all dementias worldwide are estimated to be wholly or partly due to age-related small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain. Pericytes are vascular mural cells embedded in the wall of small blood vessels such as capillaries, pre-capillary arterioles, and post-capillary venules. In the brain, they control key neurovascular functions such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Pericyte degeneration leads to BBB breakdown and impaired hemodynamic responses, and is found in neurologic disorders exhibiting SVD, WM disease and cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's, stroke and CADASIL - the most common genetic cause of ischemic SVD and VCID; yet, the role of pericytes in the pathophysiology of SVD and WM disease is largely not known. Based on our pilot data obtained in pericyte-deficient platelet- derived growth factor receptor-? (Pdgfr?F7/F7) mice and published studies in TgNotch3R169C mice expressing Notch3 CADASIL mutant in vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, we hypothesize that WM pericyte loss leads to BBB breakdown and CBF reductions causing loss of oligodendrocytes, demyelination, axon damage, disrupted connectivity and disintegration of CNS circuits, which leads to functional deficits and neuron loss. Since currently available pericyte-deficient Pdgfb/Pdgfr??lines and TgNotch3R169C mice are not pericyte specific, to test our hypothesis we have generated new pericyte-specific lines such as Pdgfr?-Flp; Cspg4-FSF-CreER; iDTR mice with inducible pericyte ablation, and will develop a new mouse line with inducible expression of Notch3R169C mutation only in pericytes. We will use i) cutting-edge longitudinal dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of regional BBB integrity, dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI of CBF, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and DTI-based tractography for structural/connectivity changes, and tract-tracing based connectomics for CNS circuit level analysis; ii) behavior tests; and iii) immunohistology, neuropathology, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy tissue analyses. We will determine the effects of global inducible pericyte ablation (20-70%) (AIM 1), focal inducible pericyte loss in the anterior cingulum of the corticolimbic ciruit (AIM 2) and pericyte-specific inducible Notch3R169C expression (AIM 3) on BBB integrity, CBF reductions, WM integrity, disruption of CNS circuits and functional deficits (behavior). We expect that the proposed studies will contribute towards better understanding of the mechanistic basis of WM disease in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, and will establish pericyte as a new key target for WM disease."
"9175419","Project Summary/Abstract Human exposure to environmental contaminants is ubiquitous, and there is growing concern that exposure to some may be linked with the rise in neurobehavioral problems in children. Given the lack of conclusive evidence for many environmental toxicants, there is a critical need for well-designed longitudinal studies of prenatal and postnatal exposure with long-term follow-up to address focused questions about the impact of these chemicals, especially on neurobehavioral endpoints. We will study two chemical classes to which nearly all of the US population are exposed, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), that have been used as flame retardants and surfactants, respectively. Among an established cohort of typically developing pre-adolescent children within the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, we will determine associations between prenatal and childhood exposure to these persistent pollutants and internalizing behaviors including anxiety, depression and social impairment. We will also obtain neuroimaging outcomes to examine associations with exposure. The HOME Study enrolled women during pregnancy and has thus far followed offspring until age 8y. We will extend follow-up to include a study visit at 11-12y to study associations in the pre-adolescent period. Prenatal exposures were measured using maternal pregnancy and newborn specimens with multiple childhood samples currently being analyzed. Over 97% of participating women had detectable levels of PBDEs and PFCs during pregnancy; comparable with nationally reported levels. We hypothesize that exposures to these chemicals subtly alter the brain to produce neurobehavioral deficits that will be evident in increased internalizing symptoms and adverse changes in anatomical structure, neurochemistry, organization of white matter tracts, and connectivity of neural networks. Aim 1: To determine the impact of prenatal and childhood exposures to PBDEs and PFCs on internalizing symptoms in a longitudinal birth cohort of 11-12 year old children. Aim 2: To determine the impact of prenatal and childhood exposures to PBDEs on brain structure, organization, and function in a longitudinal birth cohort of 11-12 year old children. Exploratory aim (EA): To determine the impact of prenatal and childhood exposures to PFCs on brain structure, organization, and function in a longitudinal birth cohort of 11-12 year old children. Aim 3: To determine the potential mediational impact of brain structure, organization and function in the relationship between prenatal and childhood exposures to PBDEs and internalizing symptoms in a longitudinal birth cohort of 11-12 year old children. Aim 4: To identify appropriate statistical methodologies to determine the association of single and multiple PBDE and PFC exposures with neurodevelopment across multiple developmental stages."
"9224677","Project Summary/Abstract Scientific evidence increasingly indicates that adult disparities in health outcomes and socioeconomic status (SES) originate in childhood, the prenatal period, or preconception. The proposed research investigates whether disparities in adverse pregnancy outcomes are related to prenatal air pollution exposure, and to what extent combined exposures to adverse pregnancy outcomes, lead, and neighborhood environment contribute to disparities in early childhood educational outcomes. Both adverse pregnancy outcomes and lead exposure are patterned by race/ethnicity and SES, may accrue disproportionately to children in already disadvantaged communities facing multiple stressors and environmental exposures (such as air pollution), and have been individually associated with lower standardized test scores. Childhood educational outcomes, while important on their own, are predictors of high school and college graduation, which are essential determinants of income and health care access later in life. During the training phase of this grant, Dr. Bravo will use sibling models to investigate relationships between prenatal air pollution exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes in maternal siblings (Aim 1). This approach controls for factors shared by siblings and also informs whether prenatal air pollution exposure may indirectly affect educational outcomes by increasing risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. During the independent phase of the grant, Dr. Bravo will develop models to investigate the combined effect of adverse pregnancy outcomes, early childhood lead exposure, and neighborhood environment on educational outcomes (Aim 2). She will also develop models to estimate the impact of residential instability and changing neighborhood environment on early childhood educational outcomes (Aim 3). The proposed research requires insights from epidemiology, statistics, and sociology, as well as application of advanced statistical methods. Dr. Bravo is well-suited to this work based on her prior research experience, which includes investigating effects of temperature and air pollution on respiratory- and cardiovascular-related mortality and morbidity and studying relationships between neighborhood, air pollution exposure, and health. Dr. Bravo has access to georeferenced and longitudinally linked exposure, health, and education datasets. She has also assembled a team of highly qualified mentors and will benefit from world-class mentorship, training, and facilities. In addition to formal interaction with her mentors, she will complete coursework in statistics and social epidemiology; participate in career development workshops; and present her research at professional conferences, seminar series, and working groups. The proposed research will enable Dr. Bravo to establish an independent career in the epidemiology of health and educational disparities. Further, her findings will contribute to understanding effects of, and eventually preventing, multiple adverse exposures, thereby addressing intransigent disparities in educational, developmental, and health outcomes."
"9072015","PROJECT SUMMARY   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an annual worldwide incidence of more than 600,000 cases and a  mortality rate greater than 95%, and therefore new and more effective therapies are needed for HCC patients.  Sphingolipids, particularly ceramides and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), regulate critical aspects of tumor  biology. The anti-apoptotic and pro-survival lipid S1P is generated by sphingosine kinases (SK1 and SK2), and  there is strong evidence that SK2-generated S1P drives cancer cell proliferation. We have developed SK  inhibitors, including ABC294640, that have in vivo anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities against a variety  of cancer types, including HCC and prostate cancer. Mechanistically, our recently studies suggest that  ABC294640 mediates tumor suppression at least in part by targeting c-Myc for proteasomal degradation.  Because c-Myc is a critical driver of HCC, being overexpressed in most HCC tumors and correlating with  enhanced tumor growth and poor prognosis, defining the molecular mechanism(s) for SK2-regulation of c-Myc  activity is critical for optimizing the clinical activity of ABC294640 and other sphingolipid-targeted drugs.  Importantly, we have successfully completed enrollment to the first-in-human Phase I clinical trial of  ABC294640 at the Medical University of South Carolina in patients with advanced solid tumors, and the data  demonstrate positive safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in these patients. Of high  importance, plasma levels of ABC294640 that decrease plasma S1P levels and that are predicted to have  anticancer activity can be safely achieved in these patients.   Based on our completed nonclinical and clinical studies, we hypothesize that inhibition of SK2/S1P by  ABC294640 will mediate tumor suppression at least in part through inhibition of c-Myc expression. This novel  hypothesis will be tested in the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms by which  inhibition of SK2/S1P mediates tumor suppression via the regulation of c-Myc expression. In this Aim, we will  test our mechanistic hypothesis that SK2-generated S1P protects c-Myc from proteasomal degradation,  thereby allowing c-Myc activity, and increased tumor proliferation. As a corollary, we also hypothesize that  inhibition of SK2/S1P signaling by ABC294640 results in proteasomal degradation of c-Myc, leading to tumor  suppression. Specific Aim 2. To conduct a Phase II trial of ABC294640 in patients with advanced HCC. In this  Aim, we will test our novel clinical hypothesis that ABC294640 will provide a treatment benefit to patients with  advanced HCC, which will be associated with decreased c-Myc and S1P signaling in the tumor."
"9352417","Mineralization is a process through which an organic substance becomes impregnated by inorganic substances. It is critically important to biology and when disrupted or hyperactivated contributes to wide-ranging effects on human health particularly in aging populations. For example, deficiencies in mineralization contribute to osteoporosis and cancer progression in bone, whereas elevated mineralization contributes to vascular disease such as atherosclerosis and kidney disease. The mechanism of action of the most commonly used drug class for treating several of these conditions, Nitrogenous Bisphosphonates (NBPs), is poorly understood. Through genetic screening in human cells we identified several genes whose loss of function led to resistance to the cytotoxic effects of the NBP, Alendronate (Fosamax®). We named these genes, Targets of BisphOsphonate NitrogEnous (heretofore TBONE1, TBONE2?). We show that TBONE1 is required both for biochemical responses triggered by NBPs as well as for bone function. Endogenous nitrogenous phosphonates (NPs), which are chemically related to NBPs and come from our diet and microbiome, potently regulate mineralization in bone-synthesizing osteoblasts in a TBONE1-dependent manner. Lastly, TBONE1 deficient mice have low body mass, deregulated markers of bone remodeling and reduced lifespan. These findings suggest that phosphonates acting through TBONE1 are critical for tissue mineralization. In this proposal, we will test TBONE genes with the following aims: 1) Dissection of the mechanisms of TBONE molecular interactions; 2) Elucidation of the TBONE1-phosphonate pathway in the bones and vasculature of mice. The identification of novel TBONE genes suggests an unexpected new understanding of and path of investigation for some of the most widely used medications, bisphosphonates. Additionally, that naturally occurring phosphonates stimulate mineralization suggests an important new determinant and safer therapeutic approach for numerous aging-associated conditions."
"9150323","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How the huge neuronal diversity observed in our brain is generated and how these neurons are assembled into functional networks are poorly understood. A unique model to study these complex questions is the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), which processes olfactory learning and memory, because its basic function and development are well characterized. Each MB consists of five cell types that are born sequentially from four identical neuroblasts: first, 'non-intrinsic' (ni) neurons that do not participate to the MB are born, then ?, ?'?', pioneer-?? and finally ?? neurons are generate. Vertebrate neural progenitors also produce neuron types sequentially, indicating that temporal patterning is conserved. Drosophila NBs have emerged as an excellent model to study the molecular mechanisms that regulate temporal patterning. We hypothesize that a temporal transcription factor cascade functions in MB neuroblasts to define each MB neuronal type during development. We also hypothesize that, unlike in most brain structures, MB intermediate precursors divide symmetrically to produce two identical neurons to generate the large number of identical neurons necessary to perform MB functions. We will determine the molecular mechanisms regulating the temporal and symmetrical production of MB cell types. This will provide novel insights into developmental programs generating the diverse neurons that make up our brains. Aim 1: Define and test the mechanisms that sequentially specify MB neuron types. The sequential production of neurons from MB NBs involves four transitions resulting in five distinct cell types. We hypothesize that MB neuroblasts sequentially express a series of transcription factors as they age to confer neuronal identity. We will identify these transcription  factors and use mutant clonal analysis, RNAi and overexpression assays to address the function of these factors in producing MB neuron types. Aim 2: Study the regulation of asymmetric NB and symmetric GMC division in the MB. Although MB neuroblasts divide asymmetrically, MB intermediate precursors divide symmetrically to generate two identical neurons. In all other studied lineages, these cells divide asymmetrically to generate a NotchON and a NotchOFF neuron. We will test whether both identical MB neurons are NotchOFF or NotchON as a consequence of rotating the axis of the last cell division orthogonal to the MB neuroblast division plane. Aim 3: Determine the RNA profile of mature MB neuron types. We have Gal4 lines that mark individual MB neuron types. We will use them and others we identify to FACS and then transcriptionally profile adult ?, ?'?', pioneer-?? and ?? neurons to understand the specification of these neurons. Adult neurons may also maintain expression of the transcription factors that specify the temporal windows of MB neuroblasts. Expression and function of candidate genes differentially expressed between each MB neuron type will be tested."

"9222479","Project Summary/Abstract Mobility, defined as an individual?s ability to move about effectively in his or her surroundings, is vital for the independence and quality of life of older adults. Despite the severe burden of mobility limitations on both the individual and the public health system, effective strategies to promote mobility are sparse. Environmental factors and brain aging are both associated with age-related mobility limitations. However, mobility research often occurs in disciplinary silos, such that research on brain aging rarely accounts for the environmental context in which seniors walk and research on environmental determinants rarely considers the cognitive challenges that complex community environments pose. This proposal addresses this issue by assessing interactions of physical environment characteristics and cognitive function on walking behavior and mobility disability in a longitudinal cohort of older adults with state-of-the art characterization of the systems involved in mobility control. The aims of this proposal are to 1) obtain and test reliability of new measures of the physical environment for participants in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study using archived Google Street View images; 2) characterize the associations between physical environment, cognitive decline, and mobility; and 3) explore the associations between physical environment, speed of processing, structural integrity of the neural circuitry, and mobility in a subsample with brain magnetic resonance imaging. These aims will be accomplished by creating an environmental walkability score for participants based on factors such as sidewalk presence and safety. This measure will then be used to test associations with reported walking in the past week and reported mobility disability, or the inability to walk ¼ mile. Interactions of the walkability measure with cognitive decline will be assessed to determine whether those individuals with greater cognitive decline have stronger associations between environmental walkability and mobility outcomes. The mechanisms of these associations will then be explored using neuroimaging measures of the integrity of specific networks in the brain. This research is innovative in that it aims to break down disciplinary boundaries for the study of two important determinants of mobility performance: brain aging and the physical environment. It will also retrospectively incorporate measures of street-scale physical environment into an existing cohort of community dwelling older adults. The addition of environmental measures to the Health ABC cohort will provide a rich data resource for the aims of this proposal and for future studies by our team and other investigators. A greater understanding of the interactions between brain aging and environmental complexities could inform future intervention strategies to make community environments more accessible to the most vulnerable."
"9167130","The alarming rise of resistance to antibiotics among bacterial pathogens is a major challenge to the effective treatment of infections. A possible orthogonal strategy for countering bacterial pathogens is to make use of bacteriophages (phages), viruses that infect bacteria and are thus natural predators of bacteria. Little is known about the phages that live with the human microbiome, as they have been called the 'dark matter' of microbial ecology. However, phages are known to control bacterial populations in the marine environment and are suspected of curbing seasonal epidemics of cholera. An open question is whether phages affect bacterial populations in individual infections. The first goal of this proposal is to investigate the natural role of phages in the microbiome of wounds, using three systems: chronic wounds, abscesses, and superficial surgical wounds. The microbiome, including the phages, will be characterized to look for correlations between healing status, phage amount, and specific phage species. Phages that are found to correlate with healing are interesting targets for further study and engineering. An important related aspect of any potential phage-based therapy is to understand the consequences of phage application on the entire microbial ecology. Therefore, the second goal of this project is to develop an experimental model of a microbial ecosystem, and to perturb this ecosystem using phages specific for a particular bacterial species. The response of the ecosystem will reveal the underlying ecological interactions in the microbial community. This analysis will be used to develop a model of phage-bacteria systems. Finally, the safe application of a specific phage would, in principle, require considerable study of the biology of that phage to prevent unwanted interactions, such as gene transduction. Alternatively, hybrid phages may be developed to incorporate desirable genes from relatively uncharacterized phages (e.g., a coat protein targeted a particular bacterial pathogen) into a scaffold phage whose biology is well- known and whose safety has been previously described. Therefore, the third goal of this project is to develop a systematic approach to designing and engineering hybrid phages with known, controllable properties, based on incorporation of coat proteins from the phage metagenome into the model phage M13. The work proposed here will help delineate the potential of phage- based alternatives to antibiotics."
"9217013","Wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors occur at a rate of roughly one per thousand orders in inpatient and outpatient settings, resulting in millions of potentially harmful errors annually in the US. Accurate problem lists help prevent wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors by allowing the electronic medical record (EMR) to remind prescribers when orders do not match the problem list. Unfortunately, problem lists are often inaccurate. Indication alerts prompt prescribers to add new problems to the problem list when a drug order does not match the problem list. Indication alerts also promote self-interception of wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors by increasing situation awareness. Two types of self-interception events can be measured in an automated way: (a) abandon-and-reorder?a prescriber starts then abandons an incorrect order before signing it, and then re- orders for the correct drug or patient; or (b) retract-and-reorder?a prescriber cancels an incorrect order soon after signing it, and then re-orders for the correct drug or patient. Previous work used the abandon-and-reorder and retract-and-reorder methods to measure the effectiveness of several interventions, including indication alerts, in reducing wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors, but that work was limited. First, only a small number of drugs were studied. Second, prior studies were done at a single medical center and involved only one commercial EHR. Third, until 2016, there was no validated, National Quality Forum-endorsed instrument for estimating the rate of wrong-patient orders. Fourth, the prior studies of indication alerts used posttest only designs and therefore could not test for an increase in the self-interception rate over baseline. The proposed project addresses these limitations in the earlier work and fills important gaps in knowledge about how to prevent wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors and how to improve the completeness of problem lists. The project's Specific Aims are: 1. At one hospital in Chicago and six in New York City, using two commercial EMR systems, implement a set of 30-50 indication alerts for medications that are vulnerable to look-alike and sound-alike errors. 2. Using an interrupted time series study design, quantify the effect of indication alerts on (a) the combined rate of self-intercepted wrong-drug and wrong-patient computerized prescriber order entry (CPOE) errors and (b) on the rate of each type of error viewed separately. It is predicted that indication alerts will increase the combined rate of self-intercepted wrong-drug and wrong-patient errors by roughly 25%, from 158 to 196 events per 100,000 orders, and will increase the self-interception rate of each type when viewed separately, as measured by an increase in the sum of abandon-and-reorder and retract-and-reorder events. 3. Assess the impact of indication alerts on the probability of adding new diagnoses to the problem list during encounters that include CPOE. It is predicted that indication alerts will double the likelihood that a problem is placed on the problem list during encounters that include CPOE, with new problems being placed during 12% of pre-intervention orders and 25% of post-intervention orders. The intervention should add to knowledge and improve quality and patient safety."
"9124085","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we will assess the impact of different sedative agents on the incidence of healthcare-associated infections and other complications of critical care in mechanically ventilated patients. This work has the potential to highlight a novel  risk factor for healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and poor clinical outcomes, and may set the foundation for a prospective study of sedative management as a new strategy to reduce these infections. This study is critically important because 1) healthcare-associated infections continue  to harm patients throughout American hospitals - especially intensive care patients - despite ample evidence and clear guidelines on how to prevent infections, and 2) there is sparse literature on the effect of sedative agents on infection risk, despite a rational clinical-biologicl basis for this relationship and suggestive data. Our first aim is to determine the relationship between different sedative agents and the relative rates of healthcare- associated infection in a mechanically ventilated patient population. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine will carry a reduced risk of infection compared to propofol and benzodiazepines. We will perform a matched case-control study to evaluate this hypothesis. We will obtain clinical data from a comprehensive electronic health record search of 150 hospitals in the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) network, as well as a manual chart review of HAI cases for data points not available electronically. Our analysis plan will be based on conditional logistic regression, including patients who are exposed to multiple agents simultaneously, with careful adjustment for potential confounders. Our second aim is to determine the effect of sedative choice and management on objective clinical outcomes in a mechanically ventilated population, including the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, and mortalit. It is known that non-benzodiazepine sedatives are optimal for reducing these outcomes compared to benzodiazepines, however it is not clear whether certain non-benzodiazepine agents of different mechanisms may have superior rates of these adverse events than others. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine will reduce the morbidity and mortality of ventilated patients. We will perform a cohort study of patients based on sedative exposures, using an electronic query of HCA's clinical database for data collection. Analysis will include Cox proportional hazard regressions models with time-varying covariates to identify associations between exposures and outcomes."
"9353517","ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish a Coordinating Center (CC) for the next phase of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) sponsored by the NIH. The objective of ATN is to increase awareness among at-risk youth of their HIV status and, for those with HIV, achieve linkage, engagement and retention in the care continuum. Many challenges are faced by adolescents during their transition to young adulthood, resulting from developmental changes, peer influences, identity, and self-esteem formation. Risky behaviors among adolescents, which include engaging in unprotected sexual encounters or sharing nonsterile injecting drug paraphernalia, increase their likelihood of acquiring HIV infection. In the 2013 US Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBSS), 34% of US high school students reported sexual intercourse during the prior 3 months, of which only 59% indicated condom use during last sexual intercourse. The YRBSS also found that only 13% of students had ever been tested for HIV infection. Given the global burden of new HIV infections among young people, greater involvement of adolescents in biomedical and behavioral HIV research is essential. However, significant individual, operational, and community-level barriers have been recognized to engaging adolescents in clinical prevention trials, which include insufficient understanding of research, need for parental consent, lack of access, mistrust and stigma associated with research participation. The new ATN is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating U19 investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for ATN projects. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies, comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include ATN information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to ATN by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the ATN. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for collaboration and extraordinary research productivity from protocol development through research data sharing."
"9213762","Project Summary/Abstract  The safety and quality of care provided to nursing home residents are often sub-optimal. The key insight of the ?To Err is Human? report by the Institute of Medicine in 1999 is that most adverse safety events and errors in healthcare can be traced to system-level rather than individual staff-related issues. This has shifted patient safety improvement efforts from targeting individual staff to re-engineering the structures and processes of care in order to prevent future errors. This focus on ?culture of safety? also emphasizes supports for (rather than blame and punishment of) providers, continuous performance improvement, and evidence- based practices. While important efforts have been made to improve the patient safety culture in hospitals, relatively little attention has been paid to improving the safety culture in nursing homes. During the past several decades, federal and state policies have been implemented to address the longstanding resident care issues plaguing the nursing home industry. Key state policies ? including Medicaid nursing home reimbursement rates and methods (e.g. case-mix adjusted payment), state minimum quality mandates, and state minimum nurse staffing standards ? are shown to have improved nursing home quality and outcomes. Despite these positive findings, many safety and quality problems persist, suggesting the need for additional studies to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of these policies. This proposed study is designed to fill a significant knowledge gap by evaluating the impact of these broad state quality-of-care policies on the development of safety culture in nursing homes. The overall goal of the project is to identify those aspects of state regulatory & payment policies that may foster or prevent the development of nursing home patient safety culture. To achieve this goal, we will measure multiple domains of safety culture performance (e.g. management support for resident safety, non-punitive response to mistakes, and teamwork among healthcare providers) using the AHRQ developed and validated Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture (NHSPSC) instrument to be administered to top managers (administrators and directors of nursing) in a nationally-representative sample of nursing homes. We will also employ administrative and public use data for 2016, as well as collect primary data from state officials responsible for state nursing home quality regulations and state Medicaid programs. These data will be used to construct nursing home safety culture measures, and measures of state policies, facility covariates, and market conditions. Hypotheses will be tested using multivariable instrumental variable analyses and structural equation modeling performed at the nursing facility level."
"9239979","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccines are one of the most successful interventions in public health, preventing a variety of infectious diseases and providing a substantial health care cost savings. Even so, many parents have become concerned with vaccines and are opting out of required vaccination for their children through nonmedical exemptions. This increase in vaccine refusal rates has contributed to recent infectious disease outbreaks nationwide, causing many states to restrict immunization exemptions. In fact, California enacted immunization legislation SB277, which will remove all nonmedical exemptions. As California is the first state in more than three decades to eliminate all nonmedical exemptions we do not currently have an evidence base of the effect policy changes such as this will have at the population level. The implementation of SB277 provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of elimination of nonmedical exemptions. Due to the size and importance of California in the policy landscape, the implementation of SB277 has the potential to guide other states immunization policy modifications. Therefore, the evaluation of California's recent immunization legislation could have national implications. Our team has previously evaluated vaccine hesitancy and refusal and the impact of immunization exemptions on disease control. Additionally, we have conducted analyses of the ease of obtaining nonmedical exemptions. Through this work, we determined states with less stringent requirements have higher rates nonmedical exemptions than the states with stricter requirements. We also conducted studies that documented the association between nonmedical immunization exemptions and increased disease incidence. Thus, our team's previous evaluation and analysis can be extended to study the effect of total elimination of nonmedical exemptions. The proposed study will develop an evidence base for the implementation of immunization exemption legislation through 1) analyzing rates, clustering, and variances of immunization exemptions before and after SB277 implementation, 2) evaluating the motivations, attitudes, beliefs, and health care practice burden relating to vaccinations in the context of SB277, 3) assessing the determinants and implications of variability in implementation and enforcement of legislation at the school level, and 4) ascertaining the impact of SB277 on the rates of home schooling. Ultimately, we will develop an evidence base for the implementation and effect of immunization legislation that has the potential to guide decision-making at the state and national levels."

"9305807","7. Project Summary Abstract The National Collaborative for Innovation in Quality Measurement: Implementing and Improving (NCINQ II) is a consortium committed to improving behavioral health care and outcomes for youth and families. NCINQ was one of the original centers in the AHRQ Pediatric Quality Measures Program. Our project will focus on implementing and improving the antipsychotic medication management and depression care measures we developed; two of these measures are in or recommended for the Core Set of Children?s Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid/CHIP and all are included in national HEDIS® reporting for commercial and Medicaid health plans. Antipsychotic medications are indicated for a limited range of mental health problems among children and youth and come with a potential for serious side effects with life-long consequences. Use is more common among children and youth in Medicaid and foster care, and our prior work showed that care is not consistent with guidelines. Depression is a common and disabling condition among adolescents that contributes to life-long social impairments and educational limitations. Implementation of standardized methods to screen and monitor adolescents with depression is mediocre, thus contributing to poor outcomes. Our overall goal is to improve health outcomes for children, adolescents, and their families. Our specific approach will be to demonstrate collaborative and reproducible approaches to improve quality for youth with behavioral health problems, enhance measures addressing depression and antipsychotic medication management, and disseminate findings and lessons via the extensive NCINQ II network of states, plans, provider groups and youth/family advocates. NCINQ II will convene two learning collaboratives that will involve our core team at National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), New York University, and Youth MOVE, as well as four states and nine health plans. Further, our Collaborative Advisory Panel will include additional state officials, youth/family advisors, pediatric leaders, an EQRO, and other experts. Because involvement of youth and family perspectives is a core component of NCINQ II, we will take extra steps to create genuine partnerships that foster a deeper level of engagement. We will also demonstrate innovative methods for incorporating digital health and electronic data sources into quality measurement and improvement. At the end of this four-year project, we will have refined measure specifications, guidance for successful approaches to quality improvement, reports on successes and challenges of quality measurement and improvement, and recommendations to guide policy decisions on measure reporting/accountability."
"9250012","Project Abstract Monitoring and evaluation of control programs for Schistosoma mansoni is currently performed by detection of parasite eggs in stool samples using the Kato-Katz technique. This method has known limitations in sensitivity and requires trained microscopists and functional microscopes to perform the assessments. Recently (in 2008), a point of care (POC) test that detects S. mansoni circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine has become commercially available. It is cheaper, easy to deploy, has greater sensitivity than stool exam and rapidly becomes negative upon successful treatment. At the WHO meeting on schistosome diagnostics in February 2015, the working group and subsequently the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group (STAG) encouraged additional validation of the POC-CCA to better define what cutoffs should be used for program decision making as well as for monitoring and evaluation for S. mansoni control programs. More data are needed on the performance of newly developed schistosomal antigen tests in endemic and post-MDA settings in order to be able to develop recommendations for programmatic use of these tools. Existing evidence suggests that in areas of high prevalence (? 50%), the Kato-Katz and POC-CCA assays both provide reasonable and comparable levels of prevalence and that the current guidelines are entirely adequate for morbidity control. However, there is a paucity of comparable data in areas of low (< 30%) prevalence. Thus, we propose in this study to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the POC CCA and Kato-Katz assays in areas of low S. mansoni prevalence in western Kenya. Findings from this study will help to clarify the relationship between Kato-Katz and POC-CCA and determine whether the visual POC- CCA band intensities can be used to evaluate treatment efficacy in order to inform program interventions."
"9230078","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death in the United States (US) and is one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Recently obesity rates have reached a plateau in the US but have yet to begin to decrease. The physical consequences of overweight and especially obesity can be serious and life- threatening. Diet and physical inactivity are the two major determinants of overweight/obesity and need to be addressed on a population-wide scale for positive changes to occur. Individual behavior change programs have been slow and recidivism has been great. It is increasingly understood that our physical and social environments play a large role in influencing diet and physical activity. The mission of the Tulane PRC (T/PRC), therefore, is to identify and address the physical and social environmental factors influencing obesity and its behavioral determinants (physical activity and diet) through: participatory research focusing on these factors and ways to modify them; collaboration with community partners and policymakers; communication about and dissemination of this research with researchers, public health practitioners, policy-makers, community partners, and the general public; training of students, faculty, public health professionals, organizational partners and community members; maintaining a stable Infrastructure with adequate resources and personnel with appropriate training, experience and expertise along with strong institutional support. The previous two funding cycles of the T/PRC have demonstrated our ability to develop and maintain the key elements of the T/PRC which enable us to conduct the work consistent with our mission, goals and objectives. We are proposing an applied public health intervention research that will address physical and social factors within one intervention neighborhood in New Orleans, the 9th Ward, and compare it to a non-intervention neighborhood, New Orleans East. The overall goal is to conduct applied public health intervention research that will produce sustainable environmental and social improvements in New Orleans' underserved minority neighborhoods and result in increased healthy weight-related behaviors and reduction/prevention of obesity. The primary aim is to reduce Body Mass Index by 1.5% within overweight and obese categories. Multiple strategies will be employed to determine the collective impact on an identified neighborhood with well-defined boundaries, but with enough differences within the neighborhood to determine characteristics of the best setting for maximum impact. A core cohort will be recruited for pre and post assessments, and neighborhood observations will occur for estimate of population-wide use of physical activity and fresh produce venues."
"9171188","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of cancer diagnosed. While the exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown, several risk factors have been identified as potential contributors to pancreatic cancer, including environmental factors such as smoking, drinking, diet, and exposure to environmental chemicals. Chronic exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) results in the induction of pancreatic cancer in rodents through an undefined mechanism. Due to the widespread human exposure to PFOA and its biological persistence, it is critical to understand how PFOA promotes pancreatic cancer in rodents. The objective in this application is to determine the biological mechanism through which PFOA promotes pancreatic cancer. The central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data, is that PFOA exposure leads to ER and oxidative stress, which leads to acinar cell damage and inflammation, resulting in acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) and the promotion of pancreatic cancer. Three specific aims have been developed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the time- and dose- dependent effects of PFOA on the promotion of pancreatic cancer using the well-established LSL-KRasG12D; Pdx-1 Cre mouse model. At two months of age, mice will be untreated or treated with PFOA followed by histological assessment of tumor progression at selected time-points, which will be correlated with PFOA levels and measures of oxidative stress. Aim 2 will determine whether PFOA exposure results in the generation of ER stress, leading to oxidative stress and inflammation. PFOA-mediated ER stress will be assessed using a combination of cell culture-based treatments, short term PFOA treatment in C57Bl/6 mice and PFOA treatment of KRasG12D mice which will be correlated with oxidative stress measurements. It will also be determined whether prevention of ER stress mitigates PFOA-stimulated oxidative stress. Aim 3 will determine whether PFOA exposure accelerates the process of ADM and/or increases the occurrence of ADM events. ADM, an early precursor lesion observed in pancreatic cancer progression will be evaluated in wild-type acinar cells and acinar cells which express KRasG12D in 2D and 3D cell cultures to assess whether PFOA treatment accelerates ADM and/or increases ADM events. The proposed research is innovative, as it will be the first to mechanistically identify the biological pathways and the doses at which PFOA exposure elicits ER and oxidative stress in the pancreas, and the first to evaluate the ability of an environmental chemical to promote pancreatic cancer progression in the KRasG12D genetic model. This contribution is significant, because identifying the mechanism for the induction of oxidative stress by PFOA will enable the development of strategies to prevent adverse health outcomes related to oxidative stress elicited by chemicals such as PFOA. Furthermore, these studies will enhance the research environment at the applicant?s institution and provide opportunities for engagement of undergraduate and graduate students in pancreatic cancer research."
"9353969","As the older segment of our population increases, Alzheimer?s disease (AD) has emerged as one of the most devastating international public health epidemics. There are currently no effective disease-modifying treatment or preventative strategies available. Current pathogenic models and newly implemented diagnostic criteria for AD emphasize a single pathway of disease pathogenesis, but underestimate the important contribution of vascular risk factors and of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, which manifests primarily as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During the previous four years of this project (R01 AG034189), we confirmed our hypotheses that accumulation of WMH predicts incident AD, particularly when distributed in parietal regions, and is associated with the presence of cerebral microbleeds, an indicator of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in a large multi-ethnic cohort of older adults. Accordingly, we extended our research to examine mechanistic interactions between cerebrovascular disease and AD. Our new preliminary data suggest that individuals with evidence of fibrillar amyloidosis have increased parietal lobe WMH and that hemodynamic markers of autoregulatory dysfunction are associated with both WMH and amyloid deposition, which in turn interact to promote the clinical expression of AD. This proposed competitive renewal will continue our systematic evaluation of the intersection between regional WMH and AD, and ask innovative and novel questions about the role of cerebral autoregulation and bloodbased lipid biomarkers. The aims of the project are: 1. To examine whether regional WMH and amyloid pathology confer independent or interactive risk for cognitive decline, clinical AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and neurodegeneration, indexed by regional atrophy, across racial and ethnic groups; 2. To examine the relationship of autoregulation with WMH severity, amyloid pathology, and cognition and diagnosis; and 3. To explore established and newly-modeled blood-based lipidomic profiles and their association with WMH and amyloid pathology. Importantly, we will examine the extent to which small vessel cerebrovascular disease accounts for racial and ethnic disparities in cognitive decline, and diagnosis of MCI or AD. Beginning in 2012, 500 individuals from a newly-established ethnically and racially diverse older adult cohort received clinical evaluation, high-resolution structural MRI, and a subset (n=100) received positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify fibrillar forms of beta amyloid. The current study seeks to conduct longitudinal analysis on these individuals by repeating these procedures, in addition to collecting transcranial Doppler-derived measures of cerebral autoregulation and analyzing stored blood samples for lipid profiles. The study will provide novel mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of AD and identify new targets for intervention."
"9063977","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world and a rapidly aging population. In recent years, with expanded availability of ART, many adults are aging with HIV, and further, increasing numbers are acquiring HIV at older ages. Despite these population concerns, research on the impact of the HIV epidemic on older South Africans is scarce. The overall goal of HIV after 40 (HIV40) is to examine life course and contextual variation in HIV risk and protective behaviors in a rural sub-Saharan African population among a largely neglected demographic in HIV/AIDS research: adults aged 40-80.  We seek funding to analyze data from the longitudinal Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System (AHDSS) in rural South Africa and quantitative and qualitative data on HIV and sexual behavior among middle-aged and older adults nested within the AHDSS and collected by our research team. Our innovative and novel integrated multi-method dataset draws on five data sources including: (1) AHDSS data collecting annual censuses of 90,000 people in 27 villages followed from 1992-2014; (2) nested cross- sectional survey data of 5080 individuals (of whom 2080 are aged 40+) on sexual behavior with HIV and chronic disease biomarkers (2010-2011); (3) 60 nested life history interviews with HIV positive and negative adults aged 40-80 (2013); (4) community focus group data from 77 respondents (2013); and (5) key informant interview data from health workers in 3 local health clinics (2013). Guided by an innovative life course approach, we use these data to examine HIV risk and protective behavior in the transition from middle to older ages and the role of social context in shaping individual behavior.  HIV40 is significant in its focus on life course variation and contex in HIV risk and protection in the transition to older ages. It offers cutting edge scientific advancement in the HIV and gerontology literature that will inform approaches to HIV prevention for older adults. It is also innovative in its use of a unique multi-method longitudinal and cross-sectional nested dataset. Our research will be conducted by a strong team of investigators with complementary strengths and collaborative experience working on the substantive areas and methods proposed here. Finally, we expect our work to contribute to and directly impact HIV prevention programming in rural South Africa by leveraging over twenty years of community relationships in Agincourt."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome."
"9133339","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Remarkable gains have been made over that last century in the safety of anesthesia and surgical procedures performed in operating rooms. Despite these improvements, intra-operative emergencies like cardiac arrest and massive hemorrhage do occur. The infrequency of these emergencies, while fortunate, challenges operating teams to work at their highest levels in situations that they rarely encounter. Particularly under stress, human memory is imperfect and response to crises can be compromised by the omission of key steps or failure to consider critical possibilities, resulting i threats to patient safety and potential tragedy. Previous research, including AHRQ-funded work, has recently demonstrated that the use of crisis checklists and emergency manuals can dramatically improve team performance. Crisis checklists and emergency manuals with appropriate training in their use can provide critical direction during a crisis. There has been increasing effort in recent years to raise awareness and encourage the implementation of operating room crisis checklists and emergency manuals throughout the country. Tens of thousands of clinicians and their institutions have become aware of these tools and thousands have downloaded versions from websites. Some of these adopters have gone on to implement the tools in their operating rooms with varying degrees of success. The aim of this project is to understand the current efforts that have gone into the implementation of crisis checklists/emergency manuals in order to discover unique practices and approaches that will lead to the creation of an innovative toolkit to help others implement more easily and effectively. Through the process of encouraging adoption and implementation of these tools widely, we have assembled a database of contacts of engaged institutions and clinicians. This database provides a window into implementation efforts nationally and is unique in nature and size. Many institutions will have struggled in their efforts to put these tools into place. Many will have discovered the difficulty of training experienced practitioners to change practice and integrate the use of these tools in a crisis situation, when they had previously relied solely on memory. Some institutions will find particularly effective ways of working around these problems. Through the use of a mixed methods approach utilizing surveys and subsequent targeted interviews, we will generate new ideas, analyze implementation efforts, address critical barriers and synthesize this information into an actionable form, an implementation toolkit. This toolkit can help those who have failed and those who have yet to begin. The knowledge generated here will also benefit implementation of similar checklists in clinical settings outside of the operating room. Aspects of the lessons harvested from this research will be generalizable to efforts to implement other innovations in health care and narrow the gap between institutional adoption and effective clinical use. The project is aligned with the mission of AHRQ to improve patient safety and the quality of health care and will draw on the TeamSTEPPS program."
"9163182","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: I am a fellowship-trained retinal ophthalmologist with the long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician scientist and nationally recognized leader in the field of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). My research agenda is focused on understanding the pathobiology of AMD and developing novel endpoints for clinical trials, biomarkers of disease progression, and therapeutic targets. I have a PhD in neuroscience and a longstanding interest in age-related degenerative diseases of the central nervous system and retina. My immediate career development goal in the current proposal is to characterize the monocytic cells the retina of AMD histopathology specimens and the association of monocytes with biomarkers of disease progression (imaging in autopsy eyes and clinical patients; visual fuction biomarkers in clinical patients). With a K23 mentored award, I would acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in in ocular pathology, microscopy, photonics, retinal imaging, clinical research, and responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources of the Duke Eye Center and the Pathology department, and the significant institutional commitment will provide me with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent research career. Research: The focus of this grant is to investigate the hypothesis that infiltration of CD163+ macrophages into the outer retina in dry AMD will correlate with synaptic defects, possibly explaining some of the loss of visual function in these patients. We will assess whether infiltrating subretinal macrophages may be associated or may themselves be the structural features on retinal imaging known to be associated with disease progression. We will also evaluate whether high frequency of monocytes in the blood of patients will correlate with visual dysfunction and retinal imaging biomarkers, suggesting that retinal macrophages are derived from recruited circulating monocytes. In Specific Aim 1, using histopathological analysis of postmortem eyes with HRD, we will demonstrate that high frequency of outer retinal and subretinal macrophages is associated with markers of retinal damage (especially disrupted photoreceptor synapses) as compared to age-matched control eyes and with SD-OCT and SLO markers of pseudodrusen. In Specific Aim 2, using analysis of circulating monocytes by flow cytometry in subjects with dry AMD, we will show that the ratio of monocytes subtypes in the blood will correlate with the presence of imaging markers of disease progression and with visual function deficits of low luminance visual acuity, dark adaptation, cone contrast sensitivity and microperimetry testing. We will also isolate blood monocytes and perform analyses of gene expression to identify factors that may contribute to loss of vision. This body of work, which will constitute the basis of an R01 grant, will allow the discovery of new biomarkers of AMD progression and therapeutic targets involving macrophages."

"9177499","ABSTRACT The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal how electrically non-excitable glial cells support synaptic transmission under the control of neurons using visual system as a model. As previous studies on vision mostly have been focused on the visual transduction cascades and the neuronal circuits, our knowledge about the role of glial cells in vision is still very limited. It is well established that visual glial cells are known for their functions in neuron protection, structural maintenance and control of environmental K+ and neurotransmitter levels. But neurobiological research in the last decade has found that, in addition to supportive roles, the central neuropil glia astrocytes can respond to various neurotransmitters, thus they may actively modulate neuronal synaptic transmissions. Neurotransmitter receptors are also detected in visual glia including Müller cells. However, it remains to be elucidated on how glia support signal transmission in visual system, and how this glial function is regulated conversely by neurons. We are proposing to use the Drosophila visual system as a novel, genetic model to study this function of perisynaptic glia, which allows the observation of neuronal activities in live animals after signaling molecules are genetically manipulated in either glia or neuron. In the first visual neuropil region (lamina) of fly, photoreceptor axons release histamine upon light stimulation to hyperpolarize projective large monopolar cells (LMC). All neuronal processes are wrapped laterally by three epithelial glia cells (EG) in each laminar cartridge. We have previous found that EG concentrate a glutamate-gated chloride channel GluCl in special membrane processes abutting terminals of T1 interneuron. In our preliminary study, loss of GluCl diminished the Ca2+ response of LMC to light change, and impaired fly locomotion vision in dim conditions. Both dark-vision and electroretinogram defects of the GluCl mutant were phenocopied by downregulation of a glutamate transporter EAAT1 in T1, suggesting the involvement of T1 neuron and EAAT1 in the stimulation of GluCl. In addition, a cation channel NA in T1 appeared to function upstream of GluCl as well. Based on these observations, we propose to test a voltage-dependent, non-vesicular mechanism of neuron-glia communication, in which T1 neuron releases glutamate through EAAT1 to open a GluCl-gated Cl- pool in EG, and thereby facilitate the inhibition of LMC by photoreceptors. This model may represent a general mechanism for interneuron to modulate synaptic weight through glia in both fly and mammals. Using a combination of molecular and cell biological, genetic, histological, electrophysiological and in vivo imaging approaches, we will 1. Test the hypothesis that a GluCl-gated glial Cl- pool is essential for the inhibitory visual; 2. Test the hypothesis that T1 neuron releases glutamate through EAAT1 to open glial GluCl channel; 3. Test the hypothesis that depolarization of T1 is required for EAAT1 to release glutamate."
"9236938","Bone loss following spinal cord injury (SCI) is an important problem in the Veteran population. Bisphosphonates are currently the frontline therapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but do not restore bone in patients following SCI. Thus there is a need for new therapies. Bone loss following SCI results in part from disuse, but may also result from a variety of other mechanisms including the loss of blood supply to the bone. Ding et al. have shown in a mouse model, that SCI causes a dramatic loss of bone vascular volume. We propose a preclinical rat study to determine 1) whether reduced bone blood and reduced vascular volume play a role in bone loss following SCI and 2) whether bone loss can be prevented by administration of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) alone or in combination with passive motorized bicycle training. Our proposed study is innovative because 1) we will study bone blood supply comprehensively (i.e. we will measure both blood flow and vascular volume), 2) we will determine whether bone blood supply is compromised before SCI-induced loss of bone mineral and 3) we will test strategies to prevent both loss of bone blood supply and loss of bone mineral following SCI. Our study has 2 specific aims.  Aim 1: Determine whether severe SCI causes early deficits in bone blood flow and bone vascularity and whether the time course of these changes precedes or matches that of cancellous bone loss. Hypothesis 1: SCI will cause significant loss of femoral blood flow (via in vivo microsphere administration) and femoral vascular volume (via micro CT of perfused vasculature) that will precede or accompany the reduced cancellous bone volume, reduced trabecular number, and increased osteoclast surface that we have previously reported to occur following SCI.  Aim 2: Determine whether SCI-induced deficits in bone blood flow, bone vascularity, and cancellous bone volume are prevented by TMP administration or by motorized bicycle training, alone or in combination. Hypothesis 2: Administration of TMP will prevent SCI-induced changes in vasculature and cancellous bone by protecting bone blood flow. Motorized bicycle exercise will also partially protect bone as we have previously observed. We predict that the greatest protection will occur in the group receiving combined TMP and bicycle straining.  Male Sprague-Dawley rats will receive a severe contusion injury vs. sham surgery. Over 4 weeks, we will assess bone blood flow in femurs by administration of microspheres to conscious rats via the femoral artery. We will also assess vascular volume in decalcified femurs of rats perfused with vascular microfil at the time of sacrifice. We will perform comprehensive analysis of cancellous bone morphology in distal femur, employing both micro CT and histomorphometry. In addition, fluorochromes will be administered to live animals to allow for histological assessment of osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces. We will administer multi- modal therapy (TMP with or without passive motorized bicycle training) to prevent bone loss following SCI. TMP is an herb-derived agent that is approved as a food additive and has been shown to protect bone following glucocorticoid administration. Our preliminary data shows that passive bicycle training partially protects bone following SCI."
"8998420","Project Summary  The Cancer Control Program is one of two Population Science Research Programs of the Abramson Cancer  Center (ACC).The transdisciplinary program composed of 27 members who focus on the identification of the  genetic, behavioral and health care determinants of cancer susceptibility and the development and  implementation of strategies to lower risk and improve outcomes. The Program is directly concerned with  improving cancer outcomes in the ACC's catchment area and working inter-Programmatically with all Research  Programs to apply advances in science to the health of populations. The members of the Program seek to  improve population health across the cancer spectrum through advancing science in the areas of: 1) Risk  Assessment; 2) Survivorship; 3) Communication and Health Behavior; and 4) Health Outcomes. The Program  has produced a substantial body of high impact work in the current project period. In the area of Risk  Assessment, members have led multiple groundbreaking studies which established the basis for clinical  management of women with BRCA1/2 mutations, identified risk loci associated with susceptibility to testicular  germ cell tumor and established genetic and genomic predictors of response to therapy in melanoma. In the  area of Survivorship, members have set clinical paradigms for cancer survivors through establishing care plans  and demonstrating that exercise programs improve outcomes. In the area of Communication and Health  Behavior, members are national leaders in health messaging and behavioral economics, with innovative  studies on use of incentives for improving health behaviors. In the area of Health Outcomes, members lead  critically important multidisciplinary studies on how research advances are translated into clinical practice and  address health care disparities within the ACC catchment area. The Program recruited 13 members in the  project period, with particularly important recruits in the area of ethical, legal and social implications of genetic  testing (Dr. Joffe), health communication and brain activity (Dr. Falk) and population-based cancer prevention  (Dr. Doubeni). The Program works closely with the Tobacco Environmental and Carcinogenesis Program to  create a robust population science initiative with widespread inter- and intra-Programmatic collaborative efforts.  Members of the Program come from nine departments within the Perelman School of Medicine, the School of  Nursing, the Wharton School of Business, and the Annenberg School of Communication. Exemplifying the  robust collaborative nature of the research environment, there have been 544 cancer-related publications over  the project period. Of these, 13% are intra-Programmatic, 37% are inter-Programmatic and 78% are multi-  institutional. Further demonstrating the substantive productivity of these collaborations, members have $11.5M  in annual cancer-related research grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $9.9M is peer-reviewed and  $5.3M is NCI-funded."
"9126265","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a Prevention Research Center that uses community-based prevention marketing (CBPM) to adapt, implement, evaluate, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to strengthen state and local health departments' and community coalitions' capacity for sustained disease prevention and health promotion. The FPRC's health priority will be the reduction of cancer disparities, and the core research project for the next five years will focus on the promotion of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). The FPRC's mission and core research are responsive to the Guide to Community Preventive Services' focus on multilevel interventions to increase screening for cancer. The core research project will focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), selected by our State partner - the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), because it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the U.S. While scientific cancer advances are occurring, racial ethnic minorities and the medically underserved have consistently experienced the highest CRC mortality rates. The aims of the core research project are to: 1) examine disparities in late stage  colorectal cancer incidence and screening rates to identify priority populations; 2) identify appropriate and feasible evidence-based interventions (EBI) for the priority populations; 3) conduct formative research with priority populations and key stakeholders to assess the EBIs' acceptability and to tailor EBIs to better meet priority population(s)' preferences and needs; and 4) implement and evaluate the multilevel intervention and make recommendations for future programs and policies in the state of Florida. This proposal makes three significant contributions to prevention research. First, the FPRC will work with FDOH, a community committee and other stakeholders (e.g., American Cancer Society) to test the CBPM for Systems Change framework's ability to select, tailor, promote, monitor, evaluate, and disseminate EBIs to reduce colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) health disparities. This planning framework has the potential to equip prevention researchers, health department and community partners with an effective planning framework that accelerates the translation of research to practice. Lessons learned from this demonstration project will be used to enhance the FPRC's training website and provide technical assistance to other State health departments and community partners. Second, the FPRC and its partners will create a computer simulation model of the system in which CRCS disparities are embedded and identify evidence-based interventions appropriate for addressing determinants at multiple levels in that system. This model and formative research results will be used to design an integrated, multilevel intervention for reducing CRC disparities.  The intervention will be evaluated and the feasibility of scaling it up to other communities assessed. A dissemination plan will be created for effective components. Third, the FPRC will use lessons learned from the new and previous demonstration projects to enhance the CBPM training website and mentor other public health agencies and community partners that adopt it."
"9146398","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This is a proposal to support the research and writing for a book- Risks Unforeseen: Policy-making, Science and the Politics of Contaminated Blood - that examines the emergence of threats to the global blood supply and the processes that drove policy-making in response to these threats. It will explain the policy decisions that led to many individuals being infected wit HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) through blood and blood products in Britain. In addition to many recipients of blood transfusions, almost half the hemophiliac population of Britain was infected during the 1980s and 1990's, contracting the illnesses attendant on AIDS and/or HCV. It is a study of how international policy communities and a variety of actors in Britain - government officials, politicians, medical professionals, leaders of voluntary organizations, patients and ther families - perceived the risks of HIV and HCV infection from blood or blood products and understood the emerging scientific knowledge of these viruses. In particular, it explores how those evolving perceptions factored into decision-making with regard to blood donations, blood self-sufficiency, plasma fractionation, heat treatment, the importation of blood products and the compensation of the infected and their families. It also expands the chain of decision-making beyond the national arena, locating national policy-makers within a global environment. It will add to the relatively few empirical studies we have of policy-making with regard to blood safety. It is also a classic study of risk - risk perception, decision-making and management - and should have an impact beyond this particular field. An analysis of how the institutions of law and politics combine with public perceptions and understandings of scientific information to shape a society's decisions on risks worth taking should advance the work of sociologists, political scientists and economists in this field. It draws on uniquely rich data: a press review of the period of HIV and HCV infection; the secondary literature on blood-related health crises in other developed democracies; interviews conducted throughout the 1980s and 1990s and primary documents collected over thirty years. Developments in the ensuing years now allow for a much better understanding of the process of risk management in Britain. The 30-year-rule for government documents has been relaxed and records through 1984 have been released by the National Archives, a 1997 Freedom of Information Act (FOI) provides access to previously closed files, and two recent official inquiries provide discovery material from legal proceedings and a valuable collection of documents from the Department of Health. These data will permit a treatment of the problem of risk management in dynamic terms, as a process that unfolds over time as new types of information are generated, interpreted and fed into new phases of decision-making. It includes a unique perspective by focusing on factors that condition policy-makers' choices about competing interpretations of new scientific evidence in contexts where other pressures impinge on those choices."
"9263183","PROJECT ABSTRACT Exposure to maternal obesity in utero perturbs the organization and maturation of the neural circuitry required for the development of a child?s mental health. In view of the concomitant increase in the prevalence of both obesity and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we crucially need to understand the relationship between the two. While maternal obesity significantly increases the risk of ASD in children, how maternal obesity leads to neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring remains unknown. By combining metagenomics, metabolomics, molecular biology, genetics, electrophysiology and behavioral studies both on conventionally colonized and on germ-free mice, we will test the hypothesis that maternal high fat diet (MHFD) induces a shift in microbial ecology which perturbs social behavior and related changes in synaptic strength in offspring. In addition, we will study the gut-brain axis and specific metabolites responsible for MHFD-mediated ASD-like behaviors in offspring. By defining the basic molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MHFD-induced ASD, the knowledge gained in this study may also lead to new probiotic-based non-invasive treatments for millions of patients suffering from ASD."
"9264757","Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently been declared a new global threat and an emerging pathogen in the USA. Common features of ZIKV infection include little to no symptoms for the majority of infected adults, but debilitating neurological symptoms such as Guillain-Barré syndrome for a few infected patients. While cause-and-effect has not been proven, there is a startling and troubling correlation between ZIKV infection in pregnant mothers and microcephaly in their newborn infants. There is currently no pharmacological protection for humans against mosquito-borne flaviviral diseases. The major goal of this proposal is to develop the mechanistic understanding of the ZIKV pathology in the fetus brain. This understanding can ultimately be developed into drugs to treat ZIKV disease. It becomes now obvious that there is complex, well-balanced mutualism between the human cells and the virus, which reciprocally affect each other through multiple, albeit insufficiently understood, molecular, cellular and biochemical mechanisms. It is exceedingly difficult, if ever possible, to understand these mechanisms by using the irrelevant cell types. In contrast with many others, our study is focused on neural precursors, the cell type infected by ZIKV in the fetus brain. A major strength of our application lies in the highly relevant expertise of our team of biochemists, bioinformaticians, neurobiologists, and virologists from the laboratories of Drs. Terskikh, Cieplak and Strongin (SBP Discovery), together with Dr. Shresta (LJI). There are two overarching hypotheses that direct our research: (1) the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) cleaves and inactivates Sox2, the key neural precursor transcription factor, and (2) ZIKV exploits multiple cellular genes to support its propagation in neural precursors. These events, especially when combined, cause neural stem/precursor cell apoptosis and reduce neurogenic capacity of surviving cells, ultimately leading to microcephaly in the fetus brain. Our interconnected and sharply focused Specific Aims are as follows: (1) Determine the physiological significance of NS2B-NS3pro-mediated proteolysis of Sox2 in the infected human neural stem/precursor cells, and (2) Identify cellular genes and major regulatory pathways that may lead to microcephaly in the infected newborns. To accomplish this aim, we will employ a plethora of the relevant cell-based assays, animal models and the advanced proteomics- transcriptomics-bioinformatics methodologies. The major outputs will be a body of knowledge that will be made publicly available and facilitate the next steps to disease eradication. Finally, it is worth reiterating that many flaviviruses cause serious neurological syndromes, and that our approach should be readily adaptable to other members of the extensive flaviviral family."

One  important aspect of it is to understand the biology, or function, underlying the large  amount of data that will be analyzed. The four projects in this Program will deal with data  and annotations at different levels. For example, genetic variation data will be analyzed  in Project 1, gene and protein data is used in Project 2, 3 and 4, while microbiome and  metabolites data is used in Project 3. Functional annotations to these datasets will be  crucial for each project to properly analyze the data and interpret the results. The key  focus of Core B is to support these projects by providing resources to annotate the data.  The Core will work very closely with Core D (Data analysis and software development),  which provides support in centralized data storage.  The project will leverage the existing in-house annotation tools, for example, ANNOVAR  for genetic variant annotation and PANTHER for gene/protein annotation, and identify  external resources, prioritize and build an integrative and comprehensive infrastructure  for annotation. The system will allow us to annotate and re-annotate data that are  brought into the Program by Core D. It is crucial to maintain all annotations up to date,  so it should make frequently updates from the source. It should also have a user-friendly  interface to allow members in the Program to annotate the data while they are  generating them, browse and identify the data of interest and retrieve shared results by  other researchers.   "
"9121614","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications."
"9188495","While nanotechnology has significant potential to address critical societal needs, innovators, policy makers and the public have concerns that the novel properties of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) may cause harm. The number of new ENMs being generated is outpacing our efforts to understand the impacts of these materials. To advance our understanding and to keep pace with new innovations, we increasingly need advances in ENM synthesis, characterization, and bioactivity screening. Due to the complexity of this challenge, highly interactive multi-disciplinary teams are needed. We will collaborate with the Nanomaterials Health Implications Research (NHIR): Engineered Nanomaterials Resource and Coordination Core (ERCC). We expect that the NHIR will provide precision-engineered, multifunction ENMs to probe the roles of surface chemistry and core characteristics in function and properties. We propose that zebrafish offer unparalleled advantages to broadly interrogate the interactions between ENMs and biological systems. It is now widely accepted that data collected using the zebrafish model is readily translated to humans because of the genetic and molecular conservation between these species. More importantly, the unique inherent advantages of this model provides research opportunities not possible or feasible in other systems. For example, with a small quantity of test material, it is possible to determine whether a given ENM is able to interact with biological targets to produce molecular changes in the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome within the entire animal. Sensitivity of these `omic approaches? is very high and uncertainty is reduced since all cell types are assessed simultaneously in the whole zebrafish. Additionally, changes in growth, organ development, cardiovascular function, and complex neurobehavior are easily assessed at a high throughput. Over the past several years, we have developed a number of novel tools and assays to assess the impacts of ENMs on adult zebrafish and the microbiome to further increase the sensitivity of our multi-dimensional screens. In this proposal we will rapidly evaluate the bioimpacts of the provided materials using multi-dimensional, high throughput early life stage and adult zebrafish bioassays that we have pioneered. We will rapidly provide these comprehensive response profiles to the NHIR consortium. We will complete the following specific aims: 1) Define a comprehensive biological response profile produced by exposure to ENM using early life stage zebrafish; 2) Determine the long lasting impacts of early life stage exposure to ENMs; 3) Evaluate the impact of ingestion of ENMs on the microbiota in adult zebrafish; 4) Integrate ENM responses from the zebrafish and other biological systems to develop principles to reduce hazards. We expect that with completion of these proposed studies and through interactions and collaborations with the NHIR consortium, the expanded knowledge base of ENM-biological interactions will begin to reduce the uncertainty around ENM health risks. In so doing, we will progress toward the longer term goal to maximize the benefits and minimize the negative impacts of ENMs."
"9177845","Project Summary Although advancing age affects the ability to encode information effectively, older adults remain able to remember emotionally arousing information and self-referential information better than other types of information. To date, these literatures have proceeded relatively independently, with little discussion of whether there are overlapping mechanisms that support the memory enhancements associated with emotional arousal and with self-referential processing. In fact, much research has proposed arousal-specific mechanisms or self-specific mechanisms that may support enhanced memory. The proposed research brings together two cognitive aging researchers with expertise in self-referential processing (Angela Gutchess) and emotional processing (Elizabeth Kensinger) and a quantitative psychologist with expertise in structural equation modeling and multi-level modeling (Ehri Ryu). The proposed research uses behavioral, event-related potential, and functional magnetic resonance imaging methods to test two main hypotheses. First, that there is a shared set of cognitive and neural mechanisms engaged for the encoding of self-referential information and emotional information (Aim 1). Second, that aging will preserve the recruitment of these mechanisms while disrupting many of the processes engaged during the encoding of neutral and non-self-referential information (Aim 2). By bringing together two domains of cognitive aging research that have traditionally proceeded independently, the proposed research is likely to shed new light on socioemotional processing and memory systems across the adult lifespan. Moreover, by focusing on areas of relatively preserved memory function with aging, the proposed research has the potential to elucidate the types of mechanisms that can be harnessed to maximally improve memory performance across the adult lifespan."
"9145188","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intravitreal injection has become the standard of care for drug delivery to the back of the eye.  While this method administers drug to the eye, it does not target drug delivery within the eye to the sites of therapeutic action, specifically in the choroid and retina.  This leads to inefficient use of the drug and possible side effects at off-target sites, especially in the anterior segment.  Moreover, repeated intravitreal injections are associated with side effects including endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and cataracts.  In this proposal, we seek to target drug delivery to the sites of therapeutic action in choroid and retina by injecting drugs into the suprachoroidal space (SCS) using a microneedle.  The SCS is a potential space between sclera and choroid that can be accessed selectively and in a minimally invasive way using a microneedle measuring hundreds of microns long.  Drug targeted into the SCS bathes the choroidal surface and adjacent retina, rather than distributing drug throughout the posterior segment, as occurs after intravitreal injection.  A few studies, mostly from our laboratories, have demonstrated feasibility of drug delivery to SCS.  This multidisciplinary project will provide the first in-depth study of suprachoroidal drug delivery targeted using microneedles and thereby develop novel drug delivery technologies that set the stage for clinical translation.  This project will study drug delivery to the SCS to improve treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.  We will study administration of bevacizumab, a macromolecular antibody drug in widespread clinical use for this indication, and pazopanib, a small-molecule, anti-angiogenic drug under investigation to treat CNV.  Our preliminary studies indicate that drug administration to the SCS offers superior tissue-specific targeting to the posterior segment and especially to the choroid and adjacent retina.  Based on these findings, our long- term objective is to develop minimally invasive, targeted drug delivery methods that are superior to intravitreal injections, in order to enhance drug efficacy, while minimizing drug and injection-related side effects in treating CNV.  In this study, we will test the hypothesis tha suprachoroidal drug delivery offers a safe route of administration for sustained and effective therapy of posterior segment diseases such as CNV.  The project has three specific aims:  1) Design and fabricate a minimally invasive microneedle device and determine its effect on targeted suprachoroidal delivery.  2) Determine the effect of drug physicochemical properties and sustained- release formulations on drug pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in the tissues of the back of the eye after suprachoroidal delivery.  3) Determine the efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal delivery of a small molecule drug and a macromolecule drug for sustained-release treatment of choroidal neovascularization.  In addition to improving CNV therapy, the outcomes of this project will provide innovative targeted solutions for treating other posterior segment disorders including diabetic retinopathy, dry AMD, retinitis pigmentosa, and uveitis."
"9225678","Project Summary Over the past half-century, biologists have generated a critical mass of knowledge and many compelling hypotheses about how chromatin, a collection of proteins and RNA scaffolded to DNA, regulates gene expression. This knowledge has the potential to transform our understanding of development and disease and spur new therapeutic strategies. To realize this potential, new experimental tools are needed to directly test existing hypotheses and reveal the functions of chromatin components. Of particular use would be approaches that directly and specifically track the biochemical and biophysical states of chromatin in live cells. This would unlock our ability to study dynamic changes in chromatin state in response to cellular perturbations. Observing intracellular events in temporal sequence would also enable functional studies demonstrating changes in gene regulation in direct response to changes in chromatin state. Towards this goal, we will develop small proteins that bind specific biochemical chromatin modifications. These binders will be genetically encoded, enabling their use in live cell microscopy. The development of these chromatin binders will support a new frontier in chromatin research. They will build upon the information garnered from static maps of chromatin state and expand our understanding of chromatin into both the temporal and spatial dimensions."
"9118550","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most universities in Africa are limited by the lack of resources and expertise for conducting, promoting and building capacity in research to address the above health challenges. The very few available qualified academic professionals have teaching and clinical obligations with little or no protected time for research. In addition, promising researchers who travel overseas for further training rarely return home due to the lack of well-established academic career paths, and the limited number of available local mentors, especially in the emerging field of HIV-comorbidities.The overall objective of our proposed training program is to build a critical mass of the next generation of top South African HIV co-morbidities researchers who can independently conduct, and promote the use of, locally relevant research, become independent and successful investigators. The Specific Aims are to equip junior faculty and post-doctoral students: 1) to gain knowledge in research methodology, research ethics and responsible conduct of research: 2) to conduct locally driven research that addresses locally relevant research questions in HIV-associated Cardio-Vascular Disease, Neuropsychiatry, and Chronic Kidney Disease; 3) to gain skills in scientific presentations and writing, grantsmanship, mentoring and research management; 4) to develop close engagement with the public, policymakers and stakeholders in order to translate research findings into clinical practice and public health policies. We will achieve these aims through a well-coordinated and comprehensive training program at Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa, to enhance research capacity in HIV comorbidities, including co-mentoring and short-term training in partnering institutions (University of Cape Town, Johns Hopkins University, Pittsburgh University and Harvard School of Public Health. The strategies utilized to build and enhance research capacity will include: didactic coursework, mentored high-quality research, experiential learning, pilot research grants, workshops/conferences, seminars, HIV comorbidities journal clubs, and website resources. Both face-to-face and distance learning techniques will be used. An Executive Committee (EC), after consultation with a Training Advisory Committee (TAC), will approve the recruitment, research, monitoring and evaluation of at least 6 high quality trainees, who will each be provided a developmental pilot research grant and 25% to 50% of protected research time for 5 years. Each trainee will have an individualized career development plan that will be monitored and tracked throughout their tenure and after completion of the program. Trainees will develop this plan in conjunction with their mentor(s)."

The WV Bureau for Public Health and our other partners identify disparities related to tobacco and to obesity and metabolic disease (OMD) as top health priorities. Since 1994, the WV Prevention Research Center has collaborated with these partners to transform public health policy and practice through community-engaged research and evaluation, with emphasis on tobacco and OMD. We propose to expand our impact through the following Specific Aims: (1) grow and sustain a multi-disciplinary academic-based center for innovative, community- engaged health promotion and disease prevention research and evaluation; (2) collaborate with state and local health departments, community agencies and other community partners to address state-identified health priorities and disparities; (3) foster, conduct, and translate community-engaged applied prevention research and evaluation to improve public health outcomes, practice and policy; (4) strengthen the capacity of public health practitioners, faculty, staff, students, community members, and partner organizations to conduct and apply prevention research to address practical public health problems; and (5) partner with state and local departments of health and education to: (5a) define and document current school physical education (PE) and recess practices among elementary schools in WV and compare student health and academic outcomes based on school practices; (5b) compare the impact of two school-based PE and activity interventions to standard PE based on student- and school-level outcomes; and (5c) rapidly translate research findings into environmental and policy recommendations at the state and local levels to increase student access to effective physical activity and PE. Aim 5 relates to our applied childhood obesity intervention project that addresses a CDC Winnable Battle. It also addresses gaps about the efficacy/effectiveness of prevention strategies for a priority population (i.e., rural) and a gap identified in the physical activity interventions' review in the Guide to Community Preventive Services. This multi-method project involves primary and secondary data analysis, including direct (accelerometer) and observed measures of student physical activity levels, aerobic fitness, academic achievement, and health risk factors such as overweight/obesity and elevated blood pressure. It employs a cross sectional design (Study Aim 1) and a randomized control trial (Aim 2); Aim 3 addresses knowledge translation. We hypothesize that accomplishment of all five Aims requires mutually-beneficial engagement with state/local public health and education, communities, providers, and to ensure partner trust and research relevance, and facilitate the rapid translation of applied research and evaluation to public health policies and practices that address key health disparities. We expect to provide fair, sustainable, and cost- effective research, training, and service by delivering tangible products that can be used to improve population health and vitality for years to come."
"9114895","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Background: Schizophrenia is a disabling illness, characterized by severe impairments in social, occupational, and community function. There is also ample evidence of significant cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, and these cognitive impairments directly relate to poorer functional outcomes. An increasing number of reviews and meta-analyses provide support for the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in schizophrenia, and cognitive rehabilitation services ar proliferating across the nation. In individuals with schizophrenia, the (real-world) effectiveness f this and other psychosocial treatments is diminished by lack of motivation for treatment, leading to poor treatment engagement and/or dropout. Motivational interviewing is a brief, clinically-feasible approach that has been successfully used to increase adherence to and efficacy of various treatments, and our pilot data suggest that it may also be effective in improving adherence to cognitive rehabilitation.  Objectives: Our primary objective is to evaluate whether motivational enhancement can improve adherence to cognitive rehabilitation in Veterans with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Additional objectives are to examine potential mechanisms of action (mediators) and predictors of treatment effects (moderators) associated with providing motivational enhancement for cognitive rehabilitation.  Methods: One hundred twenty Veterans with schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses will be randomized to receive either brief motivational interviewing (MI) or a sham control interview (CI), both of which will be followed by 4 months of cognitive rehabilitation. Booster MI or CI sessions will be administered monthly over the course of the cognitive rehabilitation. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted at baseline and end of cognitive rehabilitation, with additional assessments of task-specific intrinsic motivation,  cognitive training task performance, cognition and functional ability at key points throughout the study.  Significance: Improving adherence to cognitive rehabilitation can lead to enhanced cognitive function, which would in turn allow individuals to better take advantage of other psychosocial treatments, resulting in better community functioning. The proposed project will advance a line of research aimed at increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of psychosocial treatments in decreasing disability, improving community function, and promoting social integration in Veterans diagnosed with psychotic disorders. If found efficacious, brief motivational interviewing could also be adapted to enhance adherence to other forms of rehabilitation in Veterans with psychosis or other serious mental illnesses."
"9074436","Abstract ? Core A (Pathology Core)  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a uniquely challenging neoplasm because of the formidable  complexities of its histopathology, and limited tissue availability and quality. The pathologic analysis of murine  PDAC, and its cognate human counterpart, is an integral component for all projects of this P01. Broadly  speaking, these activities include evaluation of genetically engineered mice (GEM), including mice with  temporally regulated, compartment-specific disruption in epithelial and / or stromal components; analyses of  tumor promoting signaling pathways with cell-type specific localization to either neoplastic cells per se, or  within the host response in the tumor microenvironment (TME); identification and multi-dimensional  assessments of cellular components within the TME; and the cross-species validation of observations between  GEM models and human tumor samples. The Pathology Core (Core A) will collect, maintain, archive and  record all human and mouse PDAC-associated biological resources. These materials include serially  passaged patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) created from primary and metastatic human PDAC, and a  repository of annotated low-passage PDAC cell lines. Core A will work in close collaboration with the  Project Investigators to achieve three specific aims: i) to provide histology services and consultative expertise,  including centralized review in the pathologic evaluation of mouse and human pancreatic neoplasms; ii) to  provide infrastructure and technical expertise for a variety of immunohistochemical, immunofluorescent and in  situ hybridization assays with quantitative image analysis; and iii) to generate, characterize and maintain PDX  models, as well as early passage tumor and stromal cells cultures for use by the Projects and Core B  (Experimental Therapeutics). A testament to this Core?s progress stems from the creation of >165 PDXs and  >30 low passage PDAC cell lines during the previous cycle. Core A?s leader is Dr. Anirban Maitra at MDACC,  assisted by Co-Investigator Dr. Huamin Wang - both with long-standing expertise and a strong publication  record in the histopathological and molecular assessment of human and murine PDAC tissues. In addition,  Core A brings together expertise from our partner institution, Harvard (Dr. Bardeesy, site PI at MGH), who is a  prolific investigator in PDAC biology and an expert in GEM models thereof. Of note, despite the geographic  distance, there exists outstanding published evidence for collaboration between this tightly knit team. To  facilitate a seamless administration of Core A activities, we have instituted a system of regular communication  through teleconferences, Skype and use of telepathology resources that enables the three significant  personnel involved in the Core (Maitra, Wang and Bardeesy) to coordinate and serve the needs of this P01.  Core A will build upon the solid foundation of prior and ongoing interactions between investigators at MDACC  and Harvard, in order to facilitate a highly successful P01 outcome."
"9236018","Project Summary Spina bifida (SB) is a congenital birth defect that has multi-systemic effects on physical, neurocognitive, psychological, and social functioning and requires affected individuals to manage and adhere to a complex medical regimen, while at the same time managing a unique array of cognitive and psychosocial comorbidities. Nonadherence in this population can result in costly, life-threatening health complications (e.g., pressure ulcers, acute renal failure), but has received little attention in the research literature. The goal of this project is to identify targets for self-management, adherence, and health care transition interventions for youth with SB, which can eventually be applied to other pediatric populations, especially those with serious CNS conditions (e.g., CP, epilepsy). This study represents a significant new addition to the Chicago Healthy Adolescent Transition Study (CHATS) and has the following aims: (1) to test the utility of an innovative longitudinal conceptual model of medical self-management and adherence during the adolescent and late adolescent developmental periods, and (2) to identify how critical self-management constructs (e.g., the transfer of medical responsibility from parent to child) are linked with the successful transition from pediatric to adult health care settings. The current study builds on a study that began in 2006 when the participants were ages 8-15 years. Funding of this proposal would enable this research team to: (1) complete longitudinal data collection (Time 5) on the self-management and medical adherence of adolescents and emerging adults with SB (ages 16-23 years) in the context of past and present biological, neuropsychological, social, and psychological functioning, and (2) begin data collection (Time 6) on the transition to adult health care when the entire sample reaches emerging adulthood (ages 18-25 years). This study utilizes a developmentally-oriented, longitudinal model of medical adherence and self-management based on prior models focused on other pediatric populations. Evaluation of the model will be accomplished with multi-method, multi-informant research methods, including daily phone diaries, observed family and peer interactions, audio-recorded interviews, neuropsychological tests, medical chart reviews, and questionnaire measures completed by mothers, fathers, youth, peers, teachers, and medical providers, as well as a comprehensive assessment of health complications. Theory-driven, innovative analyses will be possible with multiple longitudinal data points, including the following: (1) longitudinal tests of moderated meditation models including early individual and environmental self-management factors (Times 1-4), modifiable self-management mediators and moderators (Time 5), and changes in adherence and health complications (Times 5-6), and (2) investigation of associations between successful self-management and the successful transition to adult health care, as mediated by individuals' readiness for the transition to adult care. Based on the findings of this research, future grant proposals will test the feasibility and efficacy of a two-pronged intervention that will include a self- management/ adherence intervention as well as a clinic-based intervention to facilitate the transition to adult health care. Moreover, findings will support the development and dissemination of clinical guidelines for parents and health professionals, with a focus on self-management skills and the transition from pediatric to adult health care settings."

"9000523","PROJECT-005: TRANSLATIONAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM (TT)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Translational Therapeutics Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center  (OSUCCC), led by David Carbone, MD, PhD and Denis Guttridge, PhD, unites an outstanding team of 55  basic, translational and/or clinical researchers from 17 departments within the Colleges of Business, Medicine,  Engineering, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Medicine at Ohio State University. This Program is a continuation of  the 15 year-old Experimental Therapeutics (ET) Program that included both liquid and solid tumors. However,  as the result of a strategic effort to grow the solid tumor presence in the OSUCCC, we successfully recruited  an additional 38 solid tumor physicians, basic scientists, and physician-scientists during this last funding  cycle, 16 of who came into the ET Program. We also transitioned to new leadership in the departments of  radiation oncology and pathology, as well as in the divisions of medical oncology, surgical oncology and  gynecologic oncology, each with expertise in translational medicine and each a member of this Program. With  more emphasis on translation and less emphasis on experimental pharmacology, we renamed the ET Program  ?Translational Therapeutics (TT)?. Under the leadership of Drs. Carbone and Guttridge the TT Program has  seen significant progress during the last cycle, producing 874 peer-reviewed publications among which 9% are  in high impact (>10) journals, 28% from intra-programmatic collaborations, 43% from inter-programmatic  collaborations; 59% are multi-institutional and 86% are collaborative publications. TT Program members have  collaborated on programmatic grant submissions and have been awarded 2 NCI P01s, a U01, a U54 SPORE,  and a U10 programmatic grant focused on solid tumor biology, as well as two T32 training grants. As a  consequence of these and other collaborative efforts, the TT Program has $8.8M in current annual direct costs  from peer-reviewed grants of which $7.3M (83%) is from the NCI. The TT Program is well-integrated with the  clinical teams via participation in the multidisciplinary Disease Specific Research Groups. As such, there were  5,253 accruals to interventional clinical trials during the last funding cycle of which 4,357 (83%) were  therapeutic; 2043 (47%) of the latter resulted from investigator-initiated clinical trials. The overall goal of the  TT Program is to pursue solid tumor biology in order to develop and translate promising preclinical studies into  innovative clinical trials for the successful prevention, diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors. This goal will be  achieved by performing the following specific aims: 1) Identifying alterations in solid tumor signaling pathways  to develop targeted therapeutics; 2) Identifying and therapeutically targeting tumor-host interactions; and 3)  Improving upon or developing new approaches for determining prognosis, selecting appropriate therapy and  evaluating the response to treatment. Future directions include continued strategic recruitments and heavy  leveraging of the OSUCCC's Drug Development Institute (DDI) to move a number of our exciting compounds  in the TT Program into the clinic for a variety of solid tumors."
"9165265","PROJECT ABSTRACT Ventral hernias are a frequent complication after abdominal surgery, occurring in nearly 33% of the over two million patients undergoing laparotomies in the United States each year. Currently, hernia repairs using synthetic meshes and biologic grafts have demonstrated only limited success with 24-43% of repairs failing to heal. Biologic grafts are recommended in complicated hernias where synthetic meshes are contraindicated. However biologic grafts often prematurely lose strength and integrity resulting in hernia recurrence. The only current strategy to increase biologic graft durability involves chemical cross-linking of collagen. However, such cross-linking reduces graft biocompatibility and frequently elicits an adverse host response. Hence, there is an unmet need for biologic grafts that are both biocompatible and mechanically durable.  Our preliminary work demonstrates the feasibility of using a novel hydrogel coating to modulate cellular infiltration into a biologic graft as a potential strategy to mitigate graft resorption. A non-resorbable tyramine- substituted hyaluronan (TS-HA) coating on a biologic graft (dermis) prevented cell attachment in vitro and reduced cellular infiltration, resorption and hernia occurrence at 8 weeks in a rat hernia repair model; however, the non-resorbable TS-HA coating was associated with a moderate foreign body reaction and encapsulation. The objective of this proposal is to design and investigate resorbable TS-HA coating formulations as a biocompatible strategy for improving graft durability and hernia repair outcomes. We hypothesize that transiently inhibiting cellular infiltration from inflamed visceral/peritoneal tissues during the initial inflammatory phases of wound repair (0-4 weeks) will mitigate premature graft resorption, but subsequently allow constructive remodeling in the absence of foreign body reaction and encapsulation, leading to improved durability and ultimately repair outcomes. Our approach will be to design TS-HA coatings with varying resorption rates and apply these coatings to the visceral surface of a commonly used biologic graft for hernia repair - allograft human acellular dermis matrix (HADM) (Specific Aim 1). We will investigate graft resorption, cellular and regenerative extracellular matrix (ECM) outcomes, herniation and biomechanical properties of TS- HA coated- and uncoated-HADM grafts (current clinical standard) in the well-established rat intraperitoneal hernia repair model (Specific Aim 2). If successful, this high risk/high reward proposal will address the primary limitation of poor durability of biologic grafts without compromising their inherent ?biologic? benefits. Results from this study will support future efforts to investigate TS-HA hydrogel coatings for improving the durability of biologic grafts used in other soft tissue repair applications such as rotator cuff tendon or pelvic floor repair."

Effectively engaging patients in ACOs will be critical to their success. Using a patient centered outcomes research (PCOR) engagement framework, this project proposes a novel investigation of system- level patient engagement, defined as integrating patients' preferences, values, and priorities into the design and governance of health care organizations. Medicare regulations require a beneficiary representative on ACO leadership boards as part of system-level engagement. Whether this effectively represents all ACO patients remains unknown, and ACOs have flexibility to develop novel methods. This proposal integrates qualitative and quantitative research to elicit patient preferences about system-level engagement in order to fill this knowledge gap and design a new patient engagement intervention. Working within Medicare ACOs led by academic medical centers, it will accomplish four aims: AIM1 will define a taxonomy of existing engagement strategies in use by ACOs and collect rich qualitative data about these strategies (e.g., regarding successes and challenges) from ACO leaders. AIM2 will elicit beneficiary representatives' perceptions of system-level engagement. The information gained from AIMS1-2 will be disseminated to assist ACOs' ongoing development of system-level engagement methods. It will also inform AIM3, which will elicit patients' expressed preferences regarding system-level engagement and assess their knowledge and attitudes toward ACOs via an in-depth study of 5 urban ACOs. Information from AIMS1-3 will be used to design a novel system-level engagement strategy and evaluate its feasibility in AIM4. The candidate is an Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins in the Division of General Internal Medicine (GIM) and the Berman Institute of Bioethics. His long-term career goal is to become an independent clinician investigator whose innovative PCOR enhances patients' experiences of care, improves health outcomes, and lowers costs through ethically-designed, meaningful patient engagement. He has a unique background as a practicing internist with PhD training in philosophy who in 2013 completed a joint fellowship in GIM and bioethics and health policy. In the short-term, he seeks additional training necessary for PCOR, focusing on advanced qualitative methods, survey design, and the theory and practice of patient engagement. His career development plan meets his unique training needs via didactic courses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, practical research experience, and a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team comprising expertise in PCOR, patient engagement, health system reform, and ACOs. The mentorship team includes Drs. Jeremy Sugarman, Albert Wu, Ruth Faden, Gerard Anderson, and Scott Berkowitz. The institutional environment for the project includes several institutes and centers at Johns Hopkins. First is the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics (BI), an internationally recognized leader in empirical research on the ethics of medicine, public health, and health policy. Recent emphases of BI research include a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) funded evaluation of stakeholder views of comparative effectiveness research (CER) and an effort at engaging stakeholders in the move toward Learning Health Systems (both under Ruth Faden), as well as research eliciting stakeholder views within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory (under Jeremy Sugarman). Second is the Division of GIM, which supports over 90 faculty members with diverse research interests. GIM is an exceptionally active division with a track record of successfully training junior faculty. It includes a GIM Methods Core that provides research consulting services, such as study design and statistical analysis. Third is the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHBSPH), an international leader in public health research and education. JHBSPH is home to the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research (CHSOR, directed by Albert Wu). CHSOR is devoted to research on the organization and financing of health services, including their impact on care quality and costs, with a recent focus on PCOR, CER, and patient engagement. JHBSPH is also home to the Center for Hospital Finance and Management (directed by Gerard Anderson), which specializes in policy-relevant research on payment reform and other approaches to reducing health care costs. A final key part of the institutional environment is the Johns Hopkins Medicine Alliance for Patients (JMAP), the Johns Hopkins Medicare ACO, which was approved in December 2013. Collaborating with JMAP and its executive director, Scott Berkowitz, affords the opportunity to study engagement in ACOs real-time and to ensure the project addresses issues of concern to ACO implementation. This project synergistically integrates these institutional components and applies them to a novel health care system reform context: system-level patient engagement in ACOs. Its findings - though ACO focused - will be relevant to health system reform generally and provide a strong foundation for future PCOR studies examining the comparative effectiveness of different system-level engagement strategies in terms of health outcomes, patient satisfaction, and costs."
"9046620","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants."
"9080728","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and AIDS has had a devastating effect on family food security and household wealth in sub-Saharan Africa through the debilitation of the most productive household members, decreased household income, and increased caregiver burden. Children under five living in households affected by HIV and AIDS are at particularly high risk for  food insecurity and its subsequent negative impacts on nutrition and health outcomes. While there is widespread agreement that interventions to improve food security and reduce poverty may improve ongoing responses to the HIV epidemic, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the effectiveness of such interventions on the nutritional, health and neurobehavioral development outcomes of HIV-affected children. Such interventions are most needed in settings such as Nyanza Region in Western Kenya: a largely rural, agricultural area characterized by high levels of poverty, HIV, food insecurity, and child mortality. Here, we propose to leverage the infrastructure of a recently funded cluster randomized controlled trial (NIMH R01MH107330) designed to determine the effectiveness of a multisectoral agricultural intervention on improving HIV clinical and other health outcomes of HIV-infected adults in Western Kenya (the `parent study'). We propose to assess the impact of the intervention on nutrition, health, and neurobehavioral development outcomes for HIV-affected children. The parent study will include 8 matched pairs of health facilities, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms, enrolling 44 HIV-infected adult participants per facility (N=704 adults, 50% female) and followed for 2 years. The proposed study will enroll and follow all HIV- affected children (enrolled at age 6- to- 36 months) and their primary caregiver (age >18 years) who reside in compounds of participants in the parent study (1:1 ratio, intervention and control). The study will  include a minimum of 352 children (n=176 per study arm) with their primary caregiver. Children's HIV status will be ascertained, and children will be assessed at regular intervals for two years for the outcomes of interest. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: To determine the effect of the intervention on nutritional, health, and neurodevelopment outcomes of HIV-affected children under 5 years old. Aim 2: To understand the pathways through which the intervention may improve nutritional, health, and neurobehavioral development outcomes of HIV-affected children. Aim 3: To evaluate the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention with respect to children's health outcomes (in coordination with the parent study's analysis for adults). By addressing the root causes of food insecurity and poverty, the intervention may contribute to improvements in child nutrition, health and neurobehavioral development. Our project is responsive to several priority areas of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief as well as those of the World Health Organization regarding care and treatment for children affected by HIV and AIDS. Results from the proposed study will provide the needed evidence to promote scale-up of an integrated, multisectoral approach, if it is shown to be effective."
"9235482","Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastric function characterized by delay in gastric emptying, frequently associated with chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, and malnutrition that may require nutritional support. Gastroparesis has a devastating impact on quality of life and predominantly affects younger women. In the past 5 years, the Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) has made a series of important contributions (see below) to improve our understanding of this disorder and advancing the goals of patients, physicians and the NIH for management of gastroparesis. Yet, much remains to be learned about its etiology, natural history, treatment strategies, and clinical course, which is the rationale behind our response to the Continuation of the Gastroparesis Consortium RFA-DK-10-502. The biggest barrier to effective therapeutic approaches to gastroparesis is our lack of knowledge about either its pathogenesis or its pathophysiology. Further, the correlation between the major symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pain, and current methods to measure change in gastric function (electrical, motor activity, meal emptying times) is poor at best. Finally, we do not understand the long-term outcomes of these patients and whether outcomes differ on the basis of etiology, symptom severity, and degree of emptying abnormalities. Consequently, our approach to these patients is erratic and treatment has been empirical and only partially effective, if at all, in relieving the major symptoms. The mission of the GpCRC is completely aligned with the recommendations of the National Commission on Digestive Diseases;5 specifically, Research Goal 2.6 relates to gastroparesis and states: Understand the noxious visceral signaling causing nausea and vomiting related to gastric neuro-electrical and/or motor dysfunction and the bi-directional brain-gut interactions. Gastroparesis provides an archetypal disease for investigative inquiry. Chronic vomiting, a debilitating and socially isolating digestive symptom, creates potentially life-threatening disruptions in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and compromises nutritional status. Chronic nausea remains a significant hidden disability. Nausea and vomiting usually occur in tandem and overlay with other Gl symptoms as well as presenting in numerous digestive diseases. More effective treatments for nausea and vomiting would improve quality of life and physical functioning in a vast array of illnesses. A paucity of research exists for defining peripheral noxious signaling of nausea and vomiting related to primary Gl motor/sensory disturbances. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1. Complete the current GpCRC registry; 2. To continue the GpCRC core lab, responsible for anatomic and related studies on tissue sample of patients with Gp syndromes; 3. Continue pharmacologic studies on patients with Gp syndromes; 4. Continue device studies for patients with the Gp syndromes; and 5. A new multicenter study, based on several GpCRC ancillary studies and other pilot data."
"9049055","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and as lifespans continue to extend, the incidence of cardiovascular deterioration and heart failure in humans has dramatically increased. With prolonged aging there is significant remodeling within the cellular microenvironment leading to pathological alterations of myocardial tissue structure such as fibrosis and hypertrophy. These alterations largely result from deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that adversely affect the mechanical properties of the tissue and lead to decreased contractile performance. Studying age-related heart failure in genetically tractable models is critical in order to determine what genetic influences and cellular mechanisms result in the decline of cardiac performance with age. Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, has been used previously as a model organism for cardiac genetics due to the relative conservation of human genes; however, it is also an ideal model for studying age-induced cardiac decline due to its short life span. The multilayered design of the heart provides a simpler structure in which to study how any age-associated ECM remodeling alters mechanical coupling between layers via modified ECM-costamere-sarcomere mechanotransduction to adversely impact cardiomyocyte contraction. Preliminary data suggests a correlation between ECM remodeling and contraction through reduced diastolic diameter and increased arrhythmicity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis previously used for measuring passive myocardial stiffness in Drosophila has also identified differences in the stiffness and thickness of the ECM layer between the ventral muscle and underlying cardiomyocytes. From these data, I propose that age-related ECM remodeling, i.e. ECM composition and assembly changes, alters the adhesive cross talk between fly heart layers, leading to distinct genotype-specific cardiomyopathies. I will first [1] examine ECM compositional, structural, and mechanical changes between the ventral and cardiomyocyte muscle layers in Drosophila strains to assess the effect of ECM on age-associated diastolic decline. I then will [2] functionally assess the contribution of major cardiac ECM proteins in mediating cell-ECM adhesion between layers during aging. Using the Drosophila cardiac aging model I hope to gain a better understanding of how in vivo cell integrin-ECM cross-talk affects mechanoelectric coupling of layers within cardiac tissue."
"9257926","Title: Nucleotide Excision Repair and Crosslink Repair - From Molecules to Mankind PI: Bennett Van Houten Meeting title: Third EU-US Workshop on Dynamics of DNA repair enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair and interstrand crosslink repair: from molecules to man? Smolenice Castle, Slovakia, May 11-17, 2017 Abstract: The purpose of this workshop is to bring together scientists from the EU and US to discuss our current understanding of how protein machines assemble and sort through genomic DNA to identify specific damaged sites which are repaired through the two critical repair pathways: nucleotide excision repair or interstrand crosslink repair. Several of the enzymes perform dual functions in both pathways, thus combining these two topics in one meeting provides tremendous synergy and is the unique feature of this workshop. Many endogenous agents, environmental toxicants and chemotherapeutic agents cause DNA damage that is repaired through these two mechanisms. The importance of the repair pathways acting on these forms of damage is underscored by the fact that their loss or dysregulation is associated with a variety of devastating heritable human conditions including cancer, neurodegeneration, premature aging and severe developmental abnormalities. The workshop will move from molecules to man and include a discussion of the disease syndromes associated with poor repair of these damage substrates. The main objective of this workshop is to fully address the problem of damage recognition and processing involved in nucleotide excision repair and interstrand crosslink repair by generating an understanding of the current state of the science and then articulate where the science will go once current technical and scientific hurdles are overcome. The main goals of this workshop are to: 1) highlight the state of the science and current technologies being used to study this problem; 2) exchange ideas between scientists in the EU and US; and 3) provide a forum that allows scientists in the local region an opportunity to meet and engage with scientists from the EU and US who are driving the field."
"9109977","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 will prepare the candidate for a career in clinical and translational migraine research focused on identifying mechanisms involved in migraine triggers by examining both clinical and biological phenotypes and linking them to appropriate treatments. To this end, the proposed training plan and research project will explore the hormonal modulation of migraine among women while simultaneously providing in depth experience in clinical epidemiology and biostatistics as well as in reproductive endocrinology. The training plan includes course work and tutorials involving internationally recognized mentors in each area. The research plan takes advantage of a large and rich data set from an NIH funded longitudinal multi-site study, the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN) to assess the influence of sex hormones on headache throughout the menstrual cycle and across the menopausal transition. Migraine is a neurological disorder with significant public health burden. It affects more than 36 million Americans with the annual economic impact in the U.S. estimated to be more than $36 billion (direct medical costs and lost productivity). Migraine is predominantly a disorder of women that has long been linked with sex hormones. However, sex hormones have complex functions that undergo significant changes over the course of women's reproductive lifespan. It has been challenging to study the impact of women's reproductive hormone cycles and the menopause transition on migraine, due to the lack of well characterized daily hormone cycles in women with migraine. Epidemiologic studies show that migraine prevalence increases around the age of menarche, as hormones begin to cycle, and that it declines after menopause. Within menstrual cycles, for the majority of women with migraine, headache attacks are more likely during the two days preceding the onset of bleeding and for the first 3 days of menses. However, although migraine is often attributed to drops in estrogen levels, estrogen withdrawal does not fully explain migraine occurrence across the menstrual cycle. There are limited data regarding the relation of hormonal patterns over the menstrual cycle to migraine, or the relative contributions of estrogen and progesterone. Even less is known regarding the relation of hormone patterns to migraine as women transition through menopause. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in women's vulnerability to hormones, with some women being severely affected by migraines in relation to hormonal fluctuation, while others are minimally or not at all. An ideal way to study the relative contributions of estrogen and progesterone to migraine is to compare ovulatory cycles, where estrogen and progesterone cycle in predictable patterns, with anovulatory cycles where estrogen continues to cycle in the setting of a blunted progesterone profile. No studies have used this approach, and no studies have assessed the relation of hormone cycles to migraine in relation to the stages of the menopause transition. The SWAN study has characterized daily hormone levels as well as daily headache symptom data, and has done so for one menstrual cycle each year for up to 10 years, as these women transitioned from pre- or early perimenopause to postmenopause. The K23 proposal focuses on using 264 women with history of migraine in this unique data set to increase our knowledge of how hormone fluctuations relate to migraine symptoms during the menstrual cycle and across the menopausal transition. Despite the magnitude of public health impact of migraine in women, there is a lack of clinical data regarding hormonal underpinnings of migraine and tremendous heterogeneity regarding the triggering of migraine. Better understanding of the effects of daily hormonal fluctuations on migraine occurrence over the course of menstrual cycle as well as over the menopausal transition can lead to improved parsing- of migraine endophenotypes. This improved awareness will lead to more effective and appropriately timed hormonal treatment of women with migraine."
"9202299","Project Summary  Exposure to insecticides is ubiquitous in the developing world, where women who perform farming  activities throughout pregnancy are routinely exposed.  Although several birth cohort studies in  the U.S. have shown persistent neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal organophosphate (OP)  insecticide exposure, the neurodevelopmental pathways and timing of exposure leading to adverse  outcomes is not clear.  Thus, regulatory agencies have been reluctant to change risk assessment  standards or provide specific recommendations about exposures to pregnant women.  The proposed  longitudinal birth cohort study in Thailand will: 1) build capacity of Thai researchers to develop  innovative and competitive studies of pesticide related neurotoxicity 2) measure metabolites of OP  and pyrethroid (PYR) insecticides during each trimester of pregnancy, and 3) evaluate the impact of  prenatal OP (and PYR as exploratory analysis) insecticide exposure on neurodevelopmental  trajectories from birth to age 3.  In collaboration with Chulalongkorn University (CU) in central  Thailand and Chiang Mai University (CMU) in northern Thailand, 300 pregnant women will be  recruited. Eight serial urine samples, 4 serial blood samples, and umbilical cord blood will be  collected during pregnancy to document temporally-resolved insecticide exposure during each  trimester. The Brazelton Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale will be administered to offspring at  birth followed by tests of visual attention, regulation of emotion, memory and inhibitory control  to determine how the ?cascade? of neurologic development ultimately affects overall cognitive  function (e.g., Bayley-III). Capacity building activities include development of core analytic  laboratory facilities at CMU and neurodevelopmental facilities at CU along with courses to promote  grant writing and international scientific publications."
"9143136","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This goal of this project, Eliminating CLABSI in Ambulatory Patients, is to determine whether use of 70% isopropyl alcohol embedded protective caps on central lines, layered on top of reliable use of best practice Maintenance Care for central lines, is associated with reduction in ambulatory central line- associated bloodstream infections in a high-risk population of pediatric hematology/oncology patients. The Children's Hospital Association, a 200+ member, not-for-profit organization of children's hospitals, has developed, sustained and spread quality transformation efforts focused on CLABSI elimination in hospital settings. The Association's CLABSI work is supported by an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) grant (R18 HS019590 Eliminating CLABSIs in Chronic Central Lines) to reduce CLABSI in hospitalized, non-intensive care unit (ICU) children. Preliminary analyses show a roughly 30% decrease in CLABSI rates in this high risk, hospitalized, but non-ICU population. The Association's Pediatric ICU CLABSI effort, involving over 70 PICUs, has resulted in CLABSI rates dropping dramatically from 5.5 infections per 1,000 central line days to approximately 1 infection per 1,000 central line days. Despite these successes, it remains unknown what generalizable best practices should be with chronic central lines in the home setting and how effective involving patients and caregivers across multiple institutions in CLABSI reduction efforts will be. Our proposal will build on ongoing AHRQ-funded work with 24 children's hospitals. We will use a cluster-randomized, cross over design, clinical trial to evaluate a promising new intervention to reduce CLABSI among children with chronic central lines in the home setting."
"9283852","Project Summary/Abstract Sexual violence (SV) is a highly prevalent, significant public health problem resulting in serious health, economic, and social consequences. Like other forms of violence, SV is preventable. Through its Rape Prevention and Education (RPE) program, the CDC has funded states to strengthen the SV prevention efforts of community organizations. However, the evidence base for these efforts is weak, and how best to prevent SV perpetration remains unclear. Our study will rigorously evaluate an ongoing RPE-funded program, Wise Guys: The Next Level (WGNL), which addresses SV perpetration by addressing known risk and protective factors, such as rape culture and unhealthy masculinity, gender stereotyping, communication and consent in relationships. WGNL is based on an evidence-informed theory of change and is implemented by Children's Home Society of North Carolina (CHSNC), a well-established community-based organization that has been working with men and boys since the 1990s. CHS currently implements WGNL in numerous sites that serve boys and young men at high risk for SV perpetration. In Year 1, our research team will work with CHSNC and the North Carolina Coalition Against Sexual Assault, as well as our Research Advisory Board, to identify, refine, and document the core components and activities of WGNL and formalize its implementation by CHSNC personnel. In Years 2 to 4, we will use a cluster-randomized design to randomize WGNL implementation by site and time. A total of 520 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be evaluated at pre-program (baseline), immediate post-program (2-month), and 12-month follow-up. The evaluation will be designed to measure the effect of WGNL on the primary outcome of preventing SV perpetration and, secondarily, on preventing dating violence, bullying, sexual risk behavior, and harassment. We will document the implementation costs of WGNL to inform future research and SV prevention interventions. Our proposed research addresses several research priorities identified in the CDC Injury Research Agenda for 2009-2018, including ?evaluating approaches to prevent SV that target high-risk populations and shared risk factors with other health outcomes? and ?evaluating the effectiveness of SV prevention approaches with substantial uptake and informed by evidence, but without evaluation research evidence.? Our research team has a long history of collaboration with practitioners in the SV prevention community. Our use of a practice-informed evidence research paradigm will optimize dissemination of study results to the practitioner community, and increase the probability that this program, if found to be effective, can replicated with fidelity and sustainability in other communities."
"9348966","Summary Women have a higher risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men, and 70% of the 5.4 million Americans that have been diagnosed with AD are women. Despite the clear epidemiological evidence for this sex-specific risk increase, the neurobiological basis for this sexual dimorphism is unclear. Convergent findings from our group and others indicate that stress contributes to the pathogenesis of AD through its effects on corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) transmission. Sexual dimorphism exists at the second messenger level for CRF receptor 1 (CRF1) transmission, in that CRF1-Gs signaling is favored in females while CRF1-?-arrestin-2 signaling is favored in males. This sex bias in CRF1 signaling likely results in different phosphorylation patterns among downstream targets associated with AD neuropathy, and so provide a mechanistic explanation for the difference in the risk of AD between men and women. Consistent with this mechanism, our preliminary data demonstrate that amyloid plaque development is much greater in female than male transgenic mice (APP+/CRF+/tTA+; or TT), in which both human APP and CRF are overexpressed in the forebrain. We now propose to extend these findings by investigating the hypothesis that chronic stress increases the risk of AD neuropathology in female transgenic mice due to sexual dimorphism in CRF1 signaling pathways and sex-specific protein phosphorylation patterns. We will utilize two stress-related AD mouse models (TT mice and isolation-stressed Tg2576 mice) to test our hypothesis. First, we will confirm the increase of amyloid plaque and cognitive deficits in females compared to males determine the degree to which plaque development and cognitive deficits can be prevented in female and male mice by suppressing CRF release or blocking CRF1 transmission. Then, we will interrogate CRF1's downstream effectors in primary cortical and hippocampal neuronal cultures derived from male and female mice, to investigate the degree to which Gs-PKA signaling selectively promotes the development of AD neuropathy during administration of exogenous CRF, CRF1 antagonists, and PKA inhibitors. Further, we will demonstrate the sufficiency of increased Gs-PKA signaling to promote AD pathology using the two mouse models and a virally-mediated DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) that is specific for Gs signaling (AAV-CaMKIIa-HArM3D-IRES-mCitrine). Finally, we will perform a quantitative phosphoproteomic assay to identify the sexually dimorphic phosphorylation patterns associated with increased in AD-like neuropathy and CRF1 signaling in both TT mice and stressed Tg2576 mice. This study would be the first to demonstrate the plausibility of a mechanism that could explain the increased risk of AD in women, and thus provide a mechanistic framework and novel targets for treatments that are sex- specific."
"9201831","Glaucoma is a diverse group of chronic diseases that causes irreversible damage to the optic nerve and is a leading cause of blindness affecting 67 million people worldwide. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people who receive ?proper? treatment for glaucoma still experience loss of vision. The only proven method of treating glaucoma is to reduce the pressure in the eye (Intraocular Pressure; IOP). Advanced glaucoma must achieve IOP in the low teens to stop progression. Unfortunately, less-invasive therapies like anti-glaucoma drugs and laser surgery do not commonly achieve these low IOPs; therefore, surgical intervention is required. Standard glaucoma surgeries are suboptimal with unpredictable outcomes and high complication rates. Camras Vision has created a biocompatible microchannel shunt capable of regulating IOP. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the prototype can be used to set in vitro pressure based on the number and length of microchannels within the outlet tube. The key to the Camras Shunt?s success is its design to drain aqueous humor externally, thereby, avoiding failure due to scarring within the drainage site associated with all other glaucoma surgeries. In this Fast-Track application, we will create a new generation shunt, the Titratable Camras Shunt (tCS), to enable precise control of IOP. In Phase I, we will construct a tCS prototype consisting of two outlet tubes (initially sealed with sutures), each containing a single microchannel, that allows for noninvasive manipulation postoperatively. Opening and closing of individual tubes controls and adjusts the target IOP range. Additionally, the tubes can be trimmed in 0.5 mm increments to fine-tune the IOP postoperatively. In vitro fluid dynamic testing (Aim 1) will be used to assess the ability to set pressure ranges to 10-14 mmHg with one open channel and 6-10 mmHg with two open channels, and to use tube trimming to reduce resistance 3-5% with each cut of the outlet tube. The feasibility of precisely controlling IOP in vivo (Aim 2) will be assessed in cynomolgus monkeys, which exhibit similar ocular fluid dynamics as humans, over 3 months in partnership with Dr. Carol Toris (University of Nebraska Medical Center). Success and justification for progression to Phase II will be indicated by the ability to set in vivo IOPs to 10-14 mmHg and 6-10 mmHg, maintain IOP lowering in a 2-month follow-up period (IOP does not increase more than ± 2 mmHg), reduce IOP by 3-5% with tube trimming with no evidence of adverse effects to the monkeys. In Phase II, we will optimize scale-up manufacturing in partnership with Sil-Pro Medical Manufacturing Solutions. The manufactured devices will be tested after sterilization (by radiation or ethylene oxide) based on FDA guidelines for ?Aqueous Shunts - 510(k) Submissions,? which will first include flow, stability, uniformity, and mechanical testing at Camras facilities (Aim 3). Biocompatibility/toxicity testing to evaluate safety (Aim 4), which includes systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, chemical testing, and 6-month rabbit ocular biocompatibility assessments, will be conducted at NAMSA, a GLP (good laboratory practice)-approved CRO with extensive ophthalmic experience. Success will be indicated if the final form tCS meets or exceeds guidelines set forth by the FDA for Aqueous Shunts to enable Camras Vision to submit a 510(k) application. Once commercialized, we anticipate that the tCS will make glaucoma surgery as accessible as cataract surgery, which is known for its elegant surgery, effectiveness, and minimal complications. Moreover, the proposed shunt should enable ophthalmologists to target IOP with a quick and simple procedures (tube opening and trimming) that can be maintained via routine follow-up outpatient visits."
"9266693","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an RNA virus of the flavivirus genus that is causing an emerging global epidemic. ZIKV infection has been strongly associated with neurological disorders, including congenital microcephaly, in which brain size is severely reduced. Moreover the CDC has recently concluded that ZIKV causes microcephaly. The severity of ZIKV-associated microcephaly is suggestive of an early insult to brain development. In human microcephalic brains, ZIKV RNA has been detected in neurons and prospective glia. In mouse models of ZIKV infection, virus has also been detected in these same populations. ZIKV has also been shown to infect neural stem cells impacting their growth and survival. During early stages of fetal brain development, neural stem cells produce neurons and shift to glia production as development proceeds. Neural stem cell dysfunction is thought to be an underlying cause for genetic forms of microcephaly. Altogether this suggests a potential mechanism to explain why ZIKV infects both neurons and glia. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that ZIKV infection targets embryonic neural stem cells, altering their cellular behavior and transcriptome. Using a novel set of assays developed in our labs, we will pursue two aims. First, we will determine how ZIKV impacts neural stem cells including production of new viable progeny. Second we will define the host mRNAs dynamically regulated by ZIKV infection in neural stem cells. Upon completion, these aims will elucidate a fundamental understanding of ZIKV biology, particularly within the developing nervous system, essential information for beginning to control the ZIKV epidemic."
"9206421","Project Summary/Abstract The epigenome is the ensemble of chemical modifications of DNA and chromatin that modulates genomic activities such as the transcription of messenger RNA, which further serves as the template of protein syntheses. The epigenome plays instrumental roles in gene regulation during human development and in healthy as well as disease conditions. Although the genome is nearly identical in each cell in the human body, epigenomes are highly dynamic across tissues and between cell types composing the tissues/organs. The current knowledge of the epigenome is largely built on analyses of human tissues without distinguishing the potential distinct epigenomes of individual cells. The heterogeneity of certain biological processes, such as the reprogramming of somatic cells to the highly medically valuable induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), also requires the capability of analyzing the epigenome and transcriptome of single cells. A powerful approach for studying epigenomic regulation is to profile multiple components of the epigenome (e.g. DNA methylation or histone modifications) and the transcriptome from the same sample. Such multi-dimensional analysis of single cells is highly challenging since most current methods are uni-dimensional. High-throughput sequencing based methods will be developed by the project to analyze multiple epigenomic components, including the DNA methylome and chromatin accessibility, and the transcriptome of single human cells. These methods will be first developed using cultured human cells and later adapted to primary human tissues. As a model for assay development, the methods will be applied to study single cell epigenomic diversity during the somatic cell reprogramming process that generates iPSCs. If successfully developed, these methods will greatly facilitate epigenomic studies of diverse cell types in complex human tissues and in heterogeneous diseases such as cancer."

"9352914","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Corneal infection with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) causes herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK), a leading cause of infection-induced corneal blindness worldwide. Despite intensive research and substantial progress in understanding the pathogenesis of HSK, the management of this condition continues to be challenging. One significant hurdle is our poor understanding of the role of neuropeptides, secreted by abundant corneal nerve fibers, in the development of HSK lesions. Lack of such knowledge is an important problem because neuropeptides are well known to regulate both inflammation and tissue repair. The objective of this application is to determine what regulates substance P (SP) neuropeptide levels in the cornea after ocular HSV-1 infection, and how SP interactions with its receptor NK1R control the viral load and affects the development of HSK lesions. We will approach these questions in a mouse model by using SP-/- and NK1R-/- mice. We recently reported that blocking SP-NK1R interactions in the absence of replicating virus (clinical period) significantly reduced the development of HSK lesions. However, lack of SP-NK1R interactions during active viral replication in the cornea (pre-clinical period), enhances the severity of HSK lesions, as noted in SP- /- and NK1R-/- mice. Our preliminary results showed delayed viral clearance and reduced levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF), a corneal wound healing factor, in NK1R-/- mice. On the basis of our preliminary results, we hypothesize that SP, produced in HSV-1 infected corneas by macrophages and corneal nerves, promotes corneal tissue repair and regulates the influx, survival, and function of innate immune cells involved in viral clearance therefore, enhancing SP-mediated effects during active viral replication should reduce the development of severe HSK lesions. Three aims are proposed to address our hypothesis. In aim 1, experiments will be carried out to determine the role of corneal macrophages and sensory neurons in regulating the levels of SP peptide in HSV-1 infected corneas during the pre-clinical and clinical periods of HSK, respectively. In aim 2, experiments will be carried out t determine whether SP-NK1R interactions regulate viral load in the cornea by promoting the migration, survival, and functions of dendritic cells (DCs), inflammatory monocytes (IM) and natural killer (NK) cells in HSV-1 infected cornea. In aim 3, we will determine whether enhancing SP-mediated effects during the active viral replication period through topical application of EGF alone, or in combination with subconjunctival administration of SP, modulates the development of severe HSK lesions. The information generated by this study could aid in the development of novel pharmaceutical strategies to reduce HSV-1 induced chronic inflammation by promoting viral clearance and corneal tissue repair."
"9352903","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to capture the progression of events and responses to these events in the everyday life of middle-aged and older individuals, when they are still in the labor force and during and after their transition int retirement. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) has provided major insights into the lives of middle-aged and older individuals based on interviews every two years. The proposed study aims to advance further understanding through the use of intensive data collection and an innovative design that allows very detailed and comprehensive data collection proximal to events hypothesized to impact health and wellbeing, including but not limited to retirement. First, we plan to administer the core HRS instrument every two years in the Understanding America Study (UAS, a probability Internet panel), so that we have direct comparability with the HRS. Second, we will monitor important events in the lives of older UAS respondents with brief, monthly assessments via the Internet, which will include anticipated events (e.g. retirement, job change, change in marital status) and unanticipated events (e.g. deaths, illnesses, job change); these assessments will signal an immediate intensive burst of data collection in order to better link changes in life circumstances, health, behaviors, and well-being. Third, the intensive assessments will track multiple domains of variables on a daily basis over an entire week, including daily pain, fatigue, physical functioning, stress, wellbeing, exercise, diet, social interaction, sleep, and cognitive function. Fourth, the event-based burst measurements will be embedded in the context of regular, bi-annual intensive measurement bursts, which serve as baselines for evaluating the impact of events. Fifth, we plan to conduct experiments within the intensive assessments of the feasibility and utility of wearable sensors, some of which may be adopted for permanent use in the study design. Overall, the goal is to provide a much richer picture of people's daily lives both before and after retirement and other life events that will enable the study of pathways to many outcomes, such as financial and subjective wellbeing, health, cognitive functioning, and social engagement. We expect these data to be a valuable resource for the research community as it moves to more internet interviewing and use of novel measurement devices."
"9263196","Abstract Among adult dementias, a large proportion are either due to or associated with small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain. The incidence and prevalence of SVD, which may be anticipated by aging, hypertension and diabetes, is on the rise, and causally linked to the rising incidence of dementia and age-related neurological disability. Despite the fact that diagnostic MRI can track SVD progression during a premanifest period and potential therapeutic window of years to decades, no treatments are yet available.  The pathophysiology of SVD is presently poorly understood. A widening of perivascular spaces (PVS) and white matter hyperintensities on neuroimaging are strongly associated with SVD. The perivascular expansion in SVD appears to correspond structurally with the perivascular spaces of the glymphatic system, our recently described system of glial-mediated lymphatic-like convective flow that directs interstitial fluid fluxes in the brain. The glymphatic system is analogous to the lymphatic system in peripheral tissues, which clears excess interstitial fluid and waste products from the brain. Glymphatic fluid transport pathways circulate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF), and relies on the aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-defined water channels in astrocytic endfeet to achieve parenchymal entry. Astrocytic endfeet effectively enclose the vasculature and thereby create a network of interconnected donut-shaped tunnels around the brain's arteries, capillaries, and veins. The existence of an astrocyte-enclosed perivascular space is recognized as a unique anatomical feature of the CNS, but its functional importance has only recently become apparent. Since a hallmark feature of SVD is the structural remodeling of the perivascular space, we here propose to ask, based on a compelling set of preliminary observations, if an increase of glymphatic fluid exchange plays an essential role in SVD pathobiology. The proposed studies will address the following questions: Aim 1 will map glymphatic activity in several experimental rodent SVD models, including CADASIL, hypertensive rats and mice (SHR and BPH/2J mice). Aim 2 will use MRI to assess the roles of blood pressure fluctuations, glymphatic influx or efflux, and BBB permeability on glymphatic transport and pathological fluid accumulation in SHR and controls. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that interventions which promote normal glymphatic function will slow myelin loss and the cognitive impairment in SVD. The experiments will directly correlate the benefits of anti-hypertensive treatment, exercise, and insomnia treatment with improvements in glymphatic transport.  To our knowledge, this application constitutes the first formal study focused on glymphatic functions and the perivascular space in SVD. The proposed studies will address key gaps in our understanding of SVD. Our hope is to provide novel mechanistic insight into the pathological events that leads to myelin loss in SVD."
"9092392","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism-associated genetic mutations produce altered learning abilities by perturbing the balance between stability and plasticity of synaptic connections in the brain. Such an imbalance may contribute to the rigid, restricted behavioral repertoire, insistence on sameness, and at times savant-like behavior seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Motor dysfunction is a common and early symptom of ASD. Motor learning and with it the ability to form a new behavioral repertoire is essential for children with ASD in order to socially connect and communicate. These children often have a very restricted movement repertoire and require intensive therapy in order to improve and learn new motor skills. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a transcriptional regulator that contributes to the  maintenance of neural circuit homeostasis through the activity-dependent modulation of gene expression and splicing. Its duplication causes MECP2-duplication syndrome, an 100% penetrant monogenic cause of autism, which leads to progressive intellectual disability, autism, motor dysfunction, spasticity, and epilepsy in males. Mice engineered to overexpress MeCP2 at twice normal levels exhibit a similar neurological phenotype. Remarkably, early in postnatal development these animals exhibit enhanced motor learning and memory (Collins et al., 2004), which over time progresses to motor dysfunction, spasticity and epilepsy. Such enhanced motor learning phenotype is shared across several models of autism, and is studied using rotarod training as a paradigm for consolidation of repetitive motor behaviors (Collins et al., 2004; Kwon et al., 2006; Nakatani et al., 2009; Rothwell et al., 2014). Here, we focus on primary motor cortex (area M1), which is known to contribute to motor learning. We will use chronic, in vivo, 2-photon imaging with the sensitive chronic calcium indicator GCaMP6s to follow dynamic patterns of neuronal activity elicited during locomotion in area M1. The study will start at the pr- symptomatic stage, will include a period of motor skill (rotarod) learning in which mutant animals perform better than littermate controls, and will terminate into the time period of motor regression. Tuning curves relative to the speed of locomotion, pairwise synchrony between different cell types (functional connectivity) and reliability of firing will be followed during otor skill learning and correlated with performance and motor skill acquisition memory. Mice with selective expression of the MECP2 duplication in pyramidal neurons versus inhibitory interneurons will be characterized behaviorally and studied. Specific aim 1: Study how MECP2-duplication (Tg1) mouse area M1 circuits change during motor learning at the pre-symptomatic stage. Specific aim 2: Follow how MECP2-duplication Tg1 area M1 circuit function changes from the pre-symptomatic to the post-symptomatic stage. We aim to forge a link between patterns of M1 circuit dysfunction and abnormal motor behavior in this model of the MECP2 duplication syndrome."
"9230014","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes burden and disparities require the adoption, dissemination and implementation of evidence-based strategies involving both clinical and community partners in alignment with a consistent set of goals that are advanced by multi-sector stakeholders, including front-line public  health agencies, federal agencies, health providers and payors. The proposed application seeks to establish an innovative public-private partnership between the currently funded New York University (NYU) Prevention Research Center (PRC) and the City University of New York School of Public Health (CUNY SPH) that leverages existing collaborations in public health practice and research collaborations between partner institutions and their local, state, and federal public health agencies. The proposed NYU- CUNY PRC focuses on improving the health of communities at risk for CVD disparities through the adoption, dissemination and implementation of integrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies to advance goals of the Million Hearts Initiative. Our focus will be on Asian and Hispanic American communities, which share commonalities related to immigration, migration, acculturation, language access, and cultural diversity. For the Core Research Project, the NYU-CUNY PRC is partnering with a large health plan to test integrated combinations of community health worker (CHW) models and electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical interventions for CVD prevention in South Asian communities, with an aim.to advance implementation of the Million Hearts Initiative. PRC research activities align with CDC strategic priorities of disseminating health systems interventions to improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and preventive services and improve community-clinical linkages. In addition, the PRC efforts will support efforts to improve physical activity and nutrition, a core component of the Million Hearts Initiatie and a CDC-defined winnable battle. The PRC also aligns with EHR intervention efforts by local and state public health agencies and incorporates a population health surveillance perspective. PRC activities will contribute to understanding of how best to reduce CVD health disparities in Asian and Latino American communities through research, community engagement and training involving the full range of public health practitioners, community partners, academic researchers, and students of public health and medicine. The NYU-CUNY PRC application harnesses the vast breadth of population health resources and expertise across NYC and builds upon the partner institutions' rich foundation of community engagement and strong governmental linkages to address cardiovascular prevention among diverse Asian and Hispanic communities."
"9360155","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic illness in the US and associated with significant health care burden. Despite advances in treatment, asthma control in children remains generally poor. Poor control is associated with physiological and behavioral factors as well as with environmental exposures. While research efforts have been devoted to studying the impact of physiological and behavioral factors on asthma, research on the effects of environmental exposures in children with asthma is limited. Recent advances in sensor technologies offer new ways to measure environmental exposures and improve asthma research. However, use of sensor data in research remains uncommon and multiple barriers exist. Sensor data are complex, being variable in structure from sensor to sensor, high volume and acquired at a high frequency (e.g. every minute or more), and multi-dimensional, with sensor data linked to geo-spatial location, time, and description of exposures. Further, sensors lack standards for data collection and data exchange of environmental exposures, lack common data elements, have inadequate interfaces for families, and lack of secure communication modalities for data transmission. Moreover, little effort has been made to integrate sensor data with clinical data, making it difficult to study the actual effects of the environment on asthma. The proposed PRISMS - Informatics Federation Architecture Center provides standard-based, open access architecture and standardized processes for acquisition, integration, and management of sensor data, along with clinical data from longitudinal assessments of asthma symptoms, quality of life, health care usage, and other asthma related outcome metrics. Specifically, we propose to develop three synergistic and tightly integrated projects that make up an innovative sensor monitoring system, including: Project 1: Develop infrastructure and software to facilitate data acquisition and information exchange. We will develop a platform for mobile apps to support data extraction from the child's home and environment sensors, and data processing and user-friendly interface for data presentation to the participants. Project 2: Develop a high-resolution data integration platform that will provide the common core, allowing sensor data to be integrated with clinical data, and mechanisms for securely transmitting data to the PRISMS data coordinating center. This project will leverage existing Open Further architecture, open source frameworks that promote code reusability and interoperability. Project 3: Develop a platform for researchers with flexible user interface to configure a variety of experimental designs. We will use user-centered design to develop both user and researcher interfaces. These projects are tightly integrated, linked by the architecture in project 2. Overall, these projects will standardize data collection from environmental various sensors, data integration with clinical data and presentation to enhance research to improve our knowledge of the impact of environmental exposures on children with asthma."
"9164988","Medication errors in the operating room are much more prevalent than traditional incident reports have indicated. In fact, our recent study demonstrated that one in twenty perioperative medication administrations, and every second operation, involves a medication error (ME) and/or adverse drug event (ADE). With more than 50,000 operating rooms conducting 27 million operations annually, this suggests that approximately 15.75 million perioperative MEs occur annually in the U.S. alone. Almost half of these lead to observed patient harm and the remainder have the potential for patient harm. More than two thirds of the harm caused by perioperative medication errors is serious or life-threatening. While not yet widely used in operating rooms, clinical decision support systems have been shown to prevent medication errors and associated patient harm in other patient care areas, and alerts and specific drug decision support have the potential to prevent more than 50% of MEs and 95% of ADEs in the operating room. The primary goals of the proposed research is therefore to design, build and implement platform-independent clinical decision support in the perioperative setting and to evaluate whether the decision support improves patient safety by preventing MEs and/or ADEs. Evidence-based medication-related clinical decision support rules for the operating room will be designed, prioritized and tiered, and finally validated by expert panel using a modified Delphi Approach. The decision rules will be used to develop and implement a perioperative clinical decision support tool that interfaces with existing electronic health records, using user feedback for iterative redesign and optimization. We will study the unintended consequences of the technology implementation with an interrupted time series analysis complemented by qualitative analysis of semi-structured user interviews. Finally, we will conduct a randomized controlled trail to assess the incidence of MEs and ADEs with and without the clinical decision support system, using our previously-described observational technique for ME detection. I will perform the proposed research within the Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, working closely with my mentor Dr. David Bates, a world renowned expert in patient safety, informatics and medication errors, and Chief of the Division of Internal Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, our partner hospital. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team of collaborators and consultants from across Harvard University that have deep expertise and international reputations in patient safety, medical informatics, device interoperability, and qualitative and quantitative statistical methods. This research will be complemented by formal coursework at Harvard University as well as career development workshops at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. This combination of intensive research, mentoring and formal education will provide the necessary background for me to become a successful, independent researcher in patient safety, with a focus on the use of informatics to reduce the incidence of perioperative medication errors."
"9148089","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The K22 applicant, Dr. Jacob Garza, obtained his Ph.D. in Pharmacology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (Supervisor: Dr. Xin-Yun Lu) supported by an F31 Individual Predoctoral NRSA fellowship. His thesis research focused on mechanisms underlying the antidepressant-like effects of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. He subsequently completed three years of postdoctoral training in neuroscience at the same institution studying neural stem cell regulation under the support of an NRSA T32 Institutional Research Training Grant. To diversify his research training, Dr. Garza accepted a new postdoctoral position in November 2013 in the Department of Psychiatry at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the laboratory of his primary mentor on this application, Dr. Tracey Petryshen. This new position falls within his research interest in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, and expands his training to human psychiatric genetics and molecular neuroscience.  Dr. Garza's immediate goals for this award are to obtain training in the following areas: 1) human genetics, 2) iPSC and human neural progenitor cell models, 3) genome editing technology and 4) clinical, neurobiological, and genetic aspects of autism spectrum disorder. In order to accomplish this, he has assembled a spectacular team of experts in each of the fields in which he will acquire training and gained support from world-class researchers. The mentoring committee is highly diverse and incorporates faculty members from a range of positions. The laboratories of the primary mentor (Dr. Tracey Petryshen) and the co-mentors (Dr. Mark Daly and Dr. Stephen Haggarty) are located within the MGH Center for Human Genetic Research (CHGR). These three investigators are also affiliated with the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. These institutions are located in close proximity to Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard Medical School and its teaching hospitals (of which the MGH is the flagship), and numerous other universities and research institutes. This incredibly rich scientific environment offers an outstanding training opportunity through interactions with leading researchers in autism research.  Dr. Garza's long-term career goal is to establish himself as an independent investigator at an academic institution. He envisions maintaining a strong, well-funded research program focused at identifying mechanisms of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and would like to incorporate aspects of basic science and translational research. The environment at MGH is excellent for establishing collaborations between clinical and basic researchers and is extremely beneficial for Dr. Garza's long-term goals.  The proposed research project focuses on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a severe developmental neurological disorder that affects as many as 1 in 68 children. ASD is typically characterized by abnormal cognition, inhibition of social behaviors and onset of focused, isolated, or repetitive behaviors. While neuroanatomical studies have suggested abnormal brain connectivity and development of key structures involved in executive function, the underlying causes are not known. This lack of knowledge hinders the identification of new molecular targets for the development of effective treatments. Recent large-scale patient genomic studies have identified candidate genes that are highly associated with ASD, including the ankyrin-2 gene (ANK2), which has repeatedly been implicated by ASD exome sequencing studies. ANK2 encodes the ankyrin-B membrane associated scaffolding protein that plays an integral role in neuronal function, particularly axon guidance and growth, thus disruption to ankyrin-B may have critical consequences for brain function. This proposal will characterize the functional consequences of three loss-of-function mutations in ANK2 that were recently discovered in ASD patients. Aim 1 will utilize human neuronal model to study the mutation effects on neuronal development and morphology. Aim 2 will examine the impact of the most severe mutation on the function of neural circuits regulating behaviors that are abnormal in ASD. Both of these aims will be completed during the training phase of this award. During the independent phase of this award, Aim 3 will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate mice with germline mutations in ANK2 that are present in ASD patients, and study the effects on brain development and ASD-like behaviors. The experiments utilized in this project will incorporate a wide array of research techniques including genomic engineering using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, adeno-associated viral vector delivery to the mouse brain, quantitative PCR, animal behavior analysis related to ASD, and development of a human neural progenitor cell model. The expected outcome of the research aims is dissection of the mechanisms of ANK2 in neural impairments underlying ASD, which is critical for improving our understanding of this disorder and developing effective interventions and treatments."
"9136074","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) has been a leader in protecting and advancing the health of New Yorkers through a comprehensive network of public health activities and services. The complexity of the state, from densely populated urban, to rural and suburban areas, the diversity of the state with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, warrants a public health system that is comprehensive and flexible to govern the state's public health successfully. Since the EHS-Net's inception in 2000, there have been a number of critical barriers to overcome. In regards to foodborne outbreak situations and environmental assessments, the geographic size of NYS can be challenging when coordinating a rapid and effective response. Over the past number of years, some state and local departments have experienced as much as a 30% reduction in staff due to retirements and attrition. To overcome these barriers, in part, the specific aims of this project involves engaging and strengthening the partnership with other State and local partners from environmental health, disease surveillance and laboratory authorities to improve environmental assessment data collection and foodborne disease outbreak investigations, establish and implement program evaluations and compare to national standards and disseminate educational materials to the public through a variety of mechanisms. This will allow Local Health Departments (LHDs) and State personnel from numerous agencies to apply best practices and interventions using national standards and new forms of technology identified by EHS-Net, the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR), Centers of Excellence and other Rapid Response Teams (RRT) to improve the overall health and safety of New Yorkers. The nature of outbreaks and investigations has changed considerably with the implementation of new laboratory techniques such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Sporadic cases of illness across many jurisdictions can now be linked to a common source by using PFGE technology and WGS, the complete DNA make-up of an organism can be determined to enable us to better understand variations both within and between species. These new technologies, including computerized sharing of information, will allow us to perform basic foodborne pathogen identification during foodborne illness outbreaks and apply it in novel ways that have the potential to help reduce foodborne illness. The use of these technologies and our collaboration across programs will improve investigations of illness clusters or outbreaks."
"9360195","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for HWWTP, HDPTP and ECWTP funds to support a training partnership linking two of the largest U.S.-based industrial unions with rapidly expanding immigrant worker centers. The Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), the SCEO's training entity, brings together the USW, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the Labor Institute (LI), and the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Make the Road New York (MRNY). In the next five years through these three submissions, the TMC will provide more than 65,000 workers and community residents with over 950,000 hours of training to help prevent toxic releases, fires, explosions, injuries, sickness and death. Through our proposed HWWTP five-year program, we will conduct 2,745 courses that will reach 55,950 workers, managers and community residents with 633,700 hours of training. To prevent fatalities, injuries, illnesses and releases of hazardous substances, we will focus WTP training and mentoring on H&S committee members and other activists who are in a position to help achieve concrete and lasting institutional changes at hundreds of U.S. worksites and communities. For our worker center partners, the focus will be on building a robust and widely dispersed H&S training capacity (in English and Spanish) for immigrant day-laborers and temporary workers who face a myriad of hazards on their ever-shifting worksites. The HDPTP program will establish a multi-lingual team of trainers (Specialized Emergency Response Trainers - SERTs) who are prepared to go anywhere at any time to provide training to emergency response and clean-up workers and community members engaged in massive man-made or weather-related disasters. To achieve this goal will dramatically increase the supply of Spanish language OSHA-certified Master Trainers who can conduct the full-range of HWWTP-related OSHA courses. We also will establish a SERTs infectious diseases working group to provide training expertise on donning and doffing high-level protective clothing and the proper use of related equipment to protect health care and hazardous waste workers. Our HDPTP program will offer 400 classes that will provide 9,050 at-risk workers and community residents with 119,000 contact hours. In the ECWTP program we will support and enhance workforce development programs conducted by MRNY in Queens and Brooklyn, NY, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute (APRI) in Pittsburgh, PA to place unemployed and underemployed workers in decent-paying occupations in construction, environmental cleanup and other green jobs. After providing 15 weeks of training for up to 450 workers over the term of the award, we will place at least 75 percent of these participants in good green jobs. Target Populations: The TMC has access to over 1.2 million USW/CWA workers and managers at facilities located in each U.S. state as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. They work in oil, chemical manufacturing, nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, pulp, paper, automobile parts, appliance manufacturing, cement, metal manufacturing, construction, rubber, plastics, shipbuilding, light manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, electrical manufacturing and health care. Approximately 850,000 of these workers are potentially exposed to hazardous substances covered by OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910, EPA 40 CFR 311, and DOT 49 CFR 171-177. The day laborers and temporary workers we will reach are employed in virtually every kind of clean-up activity, especially during emergencies, in addition to construction, car washes, cleaning, home care, warehousing and distribution. MRNY has over 16,000 members at its centers in New York in Bushwick, Jackson Heights, Port Richmond, Midland Beach, and Brentwood, Long Island. It is opening new centers in NJ, CT and PA. NDLON is a network of 45 day-laborer organizations in fifteen states and it estimates that approximately 5,000 workers pass through its centers nationwide each day."
"9212216","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Outreach Core of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to implement and evaluate, Cancer Care Connect, an innovative enhanced care coordination model for cancer survivors that links health system patient navigators (HSPNs) and survivorship care plans (SCPs) with community-based patient navigators (CBPNs) to improve satisfaction with care, satisfaction with navigation services, and quality of life among cancer survivors. The accomplishment of the study's goal will be facilitated by the Partnership's decade-long history of recruiting, training, and engaging lay community health workers/advisors to promote age-appropriate cancer screening, healthy lifestyles, and enrollment in cancer clinical trials. The patient navigation model used by the Partnership has been successful in the context of cancer prevention, and now it will be expanded to cover the entire cancer continuum, from diagnosis through survivorship. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to extend patient care coordination from the health system to the community using community navigation and SCPs. Following a baseline assessment, patients with a HSPN and SCP will be linked to a CBPN, and the impact of the combined health system-based and community-based navigation will be evaluated at multiple time points. We anticipate that cancer survivors receiving the Cancer Care Connect will increase satisfaction with care, increase satisfaction with navigation services, and improved quality of life. "
"9139503","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cerebral cortex is the seat of higher brain function, responsible for sensory perception, cognitive processes, voluntary movement, and consciousness. Abnormalities of the human cerebral cortex cause neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. A key feature of the functional anatomy of the human cerebral cortex is its organization into functionally distinct regions along its tangential dimension. During brain development, highly heterogeneous cell types must precisely assemble into unique neural circuits both within and between these areas to control complex behaviors and cognitive processes. The molecular mechanisms that encode cortical projection neuron subtype identity and synaptic specificity remain poorly understood. This proposal details a 3 year plan for postdoctoral research and professional development under the mentorship of Dr. Nenad Sestan, Professor of Neurobiology at Yale University. The fellow will investigate the mechanisms that form the molecular basis for intra-cortical projection neuron heterogeneity and projection identity. The fellow will build on his existing expertise in neurodevelopmental biology, microscopy, histology, and cell biology. He will further develop new expertise in  the structure and function of the developing cerebral cortex, neural circuit tracing, transcriptional profiling,  single-cell sorting, and advanced mouse genetic technologies by pursuing the following specific aims: 1.)  Characterization of intra-cortical projections in association areas of auditory cortex (A2), 2.) Transcriptional profiling and characterization of intra-cortical projection neuron subtypes in A2, and 3.) Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that establish intra-cortical projection neuron heterogeneity in A2. The expertise of Dr. Sestan in cortical development and genomics, mouse genetics, and studies of long-range projection circuitry will provide the scientific guidance and technical capabilities necessary to ensure successful completion of these aims. The fellow and the sponsor have also developed a detailed plan for professional skills development. The research and training plan proposed here, along with the fellow's choice of mentor, will provide excellent training towards the fellow's goal of an academic career studying the developmental neurobiology of the cerebral cortex and its dysfunction in disease."
"9153003","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are two overarching objectives of this postdoctoral training proposal. First, the proposed work and training plan will provide a promising young scientist with training in academic research and will provide career development opportunities to facilitate her achievement of becoming an independent scientist. Second, the overall scientific aim is to test a novel approach for improving respiratory motor function after cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) - a life-threatening problem with limited treatmen options and no cure. The proposed studies focus on coupling two novel methods to improve respiratory recovery following a high cervical SCI: overexpression of spinal BDNF using AAV-based gene therapy and intermittent hypoxia. A highly unique feature of the proposed work is the use of a multi-electrode array to record individual spinal interneurons. As a field, we know almost nothing about how the propriospinal network - likely a key part of SCI rehabilitation - is altered following cSCI. Additionally, many therapeutic strategies including intermittent hypoxia and gene therapy are progressing without a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which these therapies modulate the activity of the propriospinal network. Defining the spinal circuitry after chronic cSCI is essential for designing evidence-based respiratory rehabilitation and spinal cord repair approaches. The two specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To test the hypothesis that controlled overexpression of spinal BDNF modulates the activity of cervical spinal interneurons to enhance the excitability of the network and promote recovery following cSCI.; and 2) To test the hypothesis that following cSCI, overexpression of spinal BDNF coupled with IH act synergistically to alter the excitability of cervical spinal interneurons and enhance the efficacy of respiratory neuroplasticity. To test our hypotheses, we will use an established rodent model of cSCI (C2 hemisection; C2Hx) and a multi-disciplinary approach including in vivo neurophysiology, AAV-based technology, multi-electrode arrays, histology, and behavioral outcome measures. If successful, the proposed research will make transformative advances in the approach to treating respiratory dysfunction after cervical spinal cord injury."
"9144351","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite being identified in the 1999 Institute of Medicine report 'To Err is Human' as a central facet of patient safety and quality improvement, diagnostic errors (missed, delayed or incorrect diagnoses) remain understudied and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Limited pediatric-focused research on diagnostic errors highlights the significance of the problem in children: 54% of pediatricians report making a diagnostic error at least monthly and 45% report making a diagnostic error that harms patients at least annually. Errors in diagnosis were the most prevalent cause in closed pediatric malpractice claims. Few studies investigate pediatric diagnostic errors and even fewer attempt to reduce them. This grant proposes to conduct a multisite, prospective, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial testing a quality improvement collaborative intervention within the American Academy of Pediatrics' Quality Improvement Innovation Networks (QuIIN) to reduce the incidence of pediatric primary care diagnostic errors. The proposal will focus on 3 specific, high-risk, ambulatory diagnostic errors each representing a unique dimension of diagnostic assessment: evaluation of symptoms (missed diagnosis of adolescent depression), evaluation of signs (missed diagnosis of pediatric elevated blood pressure) and follow-up of diagnostic tests (delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory results). This proposal specifically responds to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice NOT- HS-13-009 designed to improve diagnostic performance in ambulatory care settings, and focuses on children, an AHRQ priority population. We will test whether a quality improvement collaborative, consisting of evidence- based best-practice methodologies, mini-root cause analyses, data sharing, and behavior change techniques, is associated with a reduction in these 3 specific diagnostic error rates in a randomized national group of pediatric primary care practices. This proposal will enhance the epidemiologic understanding of ambulatory pediatric diagnostic errors through baseline data collected from the quality improvement collaborative and the control group. This research will serve as a potential foundation for projects aimed at global reductions of pediatric diagnostic errors across settings and diagnoses."
"9167853","Project Summary/Abstract Organ transplantation remains the single most effective treatment for end-stage organ failure, and in 2014, approximately 30,000 organs were transplanted despite the well over 123,000 men, women and children needing the lifesaving operation. Consequently, detecting the onset of organ rejection is an important part of clinical management, and is critical for the survival and health of the recipient. The invasive biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing graft injury, yet it lacks sensitivity and specificity, and detects pathological changes at advanced and irreversible stages of allograft damage. Thus there remains a need for noninvasive and predictive biomarkers that indicate damage when changes are occurring at the molecular level before changes in tissue morphology. This proposal aims to develop activity-based probes that are engineered to be administered intravenously and then amplify diagnostic signals into urine at the earliest stages of rejection. Proteases play central roles in immunity and their activity mediate organ rejection; these include granzymes secreted by anti-graft CD8 T cells, caspases activated by cells undergoing apoptosis, complement activation by antibody-mediated rejection, and matrix metalloproteinases upregulated during fibrosis. We will develop activity-base probes called synthetic biomarkers that are made of a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates conjugated to the surface of a nanoparticle core. After infusion, synthetic biomarkers carry out a precise chain of events to detect organ transplant rejection: they accumulate at sites of disease, present their surface-conjugated peptides for local proteases to cleave, and release cleavage fragments into urine for multiplexed detection by mass spectrometry. Synthetic biomarkers may dramatically increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity; the former, by amplifying detection signals via protease turnover combined with urinary enrichment, and the latter, by mass-barcoded multiplexed analysis to identify combinations of peptides that detect disease with increased specificity. We will used activity-based synthetic biomarkers to identify predictive biomarkers in animal models of acute cellular rejection and costimulation independent acute rejection. If successful, this platform technology may have additional applications across a broad landscape in biomedicine including monitoring the efficacy of immunotherapies, bacterial infections and point-of-care diagnostics."
"9127232","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In addition to being pests, blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes spread deadly infectious diseases including malaria, West Nile virus, yellow fever, and dengue fever between humans. Understanding the mechanisms by which mosquitoes are attracted to human hosts is therefore an important public health issue. One method of personal protection from mosquito bites is the synthetic molecule DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). Although it has been in use for more than 60 years, we still lack a complete understanding of the mechanism of action of this insect repellent. It is known that DEET repellency has at least two components: a volatile effect and a contact-mediated effect. Previous work has shown that the volatile effect of DEET requires the highly conserved insect olfactory co-receptor orco. However, the mechanisms of DEET contact chemorepellency are currently unknown. In Preliminary Studies, I showed that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes found DEET and other bitter substances unpalatable when mixed into sucrose solutions. However, the bitter taste of DEET does not account for its repellency because bitter substances applied to skin did not interfere with mosquito biting, while DEET prevented most bites. To determine which appendages sense DEET on contact, I carried out experiments in which only the proboscis had access to skin. Under these conditions, mosquitoes blood-fed on DEET-treated skin. This suggests that the proboscis is not sufficient to mediate DEET contact chemorepellency. To test if the legs are necessary for sensing DEET on contact, I occluded the hairs containing sensory cells on the legs with glue. Mosquitoes with glue-covered legs blood-fed on DEET-treated skin, indicating that the legs are required to sense DEET on contact. These Preliminary Studies lead to the Hypothesis that chemoreceptors in mosquito legs drive the contact repellency of DEET. The Objective of this proposal is to identify the DEET contact chemoreceptor(s). I propose two Specific Aims to test this Hypothesis and achieve this Objective. In Specific Aim 1, I will use bioinformatics to identify candidate genes expressed in the leg that may mediate DEET contact chemorepellency. In Specific Aim 2, I will generate and behaviorally characterize mosquito strains with targeted mutations in candidate DEET contact chemoreceptors. I hypothesize that mosquitoes with mutations in DEET contact chemoreceptor(s) will be less repelled by DEET, will spend more time on DEET-treated arms, and will bite DEET-treated arms more frequently. The research training plan will develop my skills in bioinformatics, genome modification, and behavioral analysis. The health- relatedness of this work is that mosquitoes and other biting arthropods spread deadly diseases to humans. A better understanding of insect chemosensation and mechanisms of repellency may lead to the design of better, longer-lasting arthropod repellents that will reduce the spread of infectious diseases."
"9124489","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sleep/wake cycle is regulated by circadian control of sleep timing and homeostatic control of sleep need. Whereas many details of circadian clock function are known, the molecular and anatomical basis of sleep homeostasis is a mystery. In this proposal, the overall research goal is to use a novel, high-throughput assay involving thermogenetic manipulation of specific arousal circuits in the fly brain to interrogate mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis. This assay involves transient activation of temperature-sensitive TrpA1 channels in select arousal-controlling neurons in the fly brain. In these animals a mild heat pulse at night stimulates behavioral arousal, thus depriving animals of sleep, which causes subsequent homeostatic recovery sleep the next day. My lab has found that only a subset of wake-promoting neurons is able to elicit sleep homeostasis, indicating that this subset likely falls within a homeostatic circuit, and this work has led to the development of  sleep homeostasis circuit model in which the activity of sleep-promoting (S) neurons is upregulated following sustained activity of wake-promoting (W) neurons. Consistent with the existence of S neurons, I have found that electrically silencing specific neurons with transgenic potassium channels suppresses sleep homeostasis without obviously affecting W neuron function or daily fluctuations in the sleep/wake cycle. Goals of this proposal are to describe the roles of molecules and changes in neuronal activity that contribute to sleep homeostasis and to determine the contribution of sleep homeostatic molecules and circuitry to learning and memory. The experiments in aim 1 focus on localization and functional relevance of two genes, identified in a thermogenetic screen, that are required for sleep homeostasis. I will use RNAi knockdown against these genes in different areas of the brain to refine where their expression is required for functional sleep homeostasis. In Aim 2 I will identify additional components of sleep homeostasis circuitry by screening for neurons which, when electrically silenced, selectively suppress homeostatic recovery sleep. I will also express different genetically encoded fluorophores in distinct identified components of sleep homeostasis circuitry to determine their anatomical relationships. In Aim 3 I will address the role of sleep homeostasis in short-term learning and memory using a robust aversive-taste training assay. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate sleep need may improve our understanding of homeostatically controlled processes in the nervous system and open the door to pharmacological intervention in sleep disorders that currently detract from human health and well-being."
"9144331","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is epidemic in the United States and other countries and poses a significant health and economic burden. As CA-MRSA is now the predominant MRSA clone in the community and in many healthcare settings, clinicians and infection control practitioners face new challenges. The community is now an important and expanding reservoir for the spread of virulent CA-MRSA strains into hospitals, likely increasing the severity of nosocomial MRSA infections. Existing infection prevention strategies are based on risk factors associated with the transmission of traditional healthcare-associated MRSA strains. To effectively mitigate the spread of contemporary CA- MRSA strains in both healthcare and community settings, we must first understand the transmission dynamics of this epidemic clone, identify factors associated with acquisition and infection, and determine the significance of environmental surface contamination in the spread of the organism.  The clustering of CA-MRSA infections in households makes this a logical setting in which to study CA- MRSA transmission dynamics. Our prior studies revealed a high prevalence of MRSA colonization in household contacts of children with MRSA disease and demonstrated that decolonization of all household members resulted in a decreased incidence of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) in index patients and household contacts compared to decolonization of the index patient alone. Pediatric patients with CA-MRSA infection and their household members will be recruited to participate in a one-year prospective natural history study of CA-MRSA household transmission dynamics. Commonly handled household objects and surfaces, and pet dogs and cats, will be cultured. Serial colonization status and infection incidence in participants will be ascertained over 12 months. Molecular typing will be performed on all recovered MRSA isolates to illuminate the directionality of transmission and to determine whether infecting strains resemble endogenous colonizing strains, strains recovered from household contacts, or strains recovered from environmental surfaces. Using mixed effects logistic regression modeling, the relationships among risk factors at multiple levels (including household colonization pressure, host behavioral practices, and contamination of household surfaces and pets) will be elucidated to identify factors conferring the greatest risks for CA-MRSA colonization, infection, and transmission. Subsequently, study participants will be randomized into an intervention study to compare the effectiveness of decolonization measures (application of nasal mupirocin and dilute bleach water baths) in preventing recurrent SSTI when these measures are performed by all household members compared to decolonizing only household members with a history of SSTI in the prior year (as determined during the natural history study). Colonization status and infection incidence will be followed for an additional 12 months. These studies will inform optimized interventions to reduce the burden of CA-MRSA colonization and disease."
"9307090","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy, results from compression of the median nerve under the transverse carpal ligament at the wrist. It is an important occupational health problem because the frequency and severity of CTS cause more disability than virtually any other upper extremity disorder (Foley 2007). The ultimate goal of this research proposal is to reduce the incidence as well as the severity of CTS in working populations by elucidating the causes of both.  Few prospective epidemiologic studies have the potential to assess the exposure-response relationships between biomechanical and psychosocial risk factors and either CTS or subsequent disability using rigorous case criteria and individual level exposure estimates. Even fewer are prospective with sufficient power to assess incidence and address sources of healthy worker survivor effect (HWSE) bias. HWSE has been shown to cause downward bias in occupational studies, and is a particular challenge in studies of musculoskeletal disorders such as CTS that are accompanied by discomfort (Arigghi 1994; Eisen and Robins 2001; Eisen 2005). There have been recent attempts to address the HWSE, using g-estimation in a mortality study of chronic heart and lung disease (Chevrier 2012), and inverse proportional treatment weights in a study of occupational asthma (Dumas 2013). However, there are no published longitudinal studies of CTS or subsequent work disability that address HWSE bias. In fact, other than a single cross-sectional study of garment workers (Punnett 1996), HWSE has not been taken into account when studying musculoskeletal disorders (Punnett 2004). If the workers exposed to repetitive and forceful movements consequently who develop CTS (including median nerve symptoms) are more likely to leave such work then those who remain exposed will be at lower risk. Such self-selection based on health status can reverse the causal direction and result in underestimation of the association between biomechanical risk factors, CTS, and subsequent work disability.  The objective of this research is to estimate the association between biomechanical exposures, work psychosocial exposures, and CTS or CTS-related work disability while adjusting for downward bias from the HWSE. To address right truncation, inverse proportional censoring weights will be used in the analysis. To address left truncation, a sensitivity analysis will be performed by varying the date of hire criterion for entry into the pooed cohort. Adjustment for confounding from time-varying variables will utilize inverse proportional treatment weights. This approach to reducing HWSE bias has not been performed in a study of CTS or subsequent work disability because most studies of musculoskeletal disorders are not of adequate size or complexity. The findings of this research will help clarify the relationships between biomechanical, work psychosocial risk factors and the severity of CTS and CTS-related work disability that can facilitate the development of comprehensive prevention strategies."
"9175692","Cilia are protrusions of the cell membrane with sensory (primary cilia) or motor (motile cilia) function. In astrocytes and ependymal cells, primary and motile cilia regulate cell division and migration, and propel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), respectively. Ciliary dysfunction leads to astrocytic overgrowth (astrogliosis) or ependymal cell malfunction and hydrocephalus. It is vital for the function of cilia in cell signaling and motility that cilium number, length, and intraciliary or intraflagellar transport (IFT) of cargo proteins are dynamically regulated. A critical barrier in understanding this regulation is the lack of knowledge on dynamically activated factors in ciliogenesis and cilium function. Although cilia are membrane structures, research so far has focused on the role of proteins in the regulation of cilia, and little is known about the role of lipids in this process. Our research goals are to determine how membrane lipids and proteins interact in the regulation of cilia and how modulation of lipid metabolism can be utilized to support the function of cilia in astrocytes and ependymal cells. Our central hypothesis is that the sphingolipid ceramide regulates cilium length and IFT, which is critical for the function of cilia in astrocytes and ependymal cells. Our objectives are to 1) test that cilia are regulated by ceramide-associated protein complexes; 2) define these complexes by using a novel technique to pull down ceramide enriched- and cilium-derived membrane vesicles and covalently crosslink a bifunctional ceramide analog to its interacting proteins to identify ceramide binding domains; 3) test that induction of receptors in cilia is regulated by ceramide; and 4) test that astroglial activation and ependymal cell function is regulated by ceramide in vitro and in vivo. Our expected outcomes include 1) determining ceramide species that promote ciliogenesis and support cilium function, and how the generation of ciliogenic ceramide is regulated; 2) defining a mechanism of cilium extension and IFT regulation by interaction of ceramide with atypical PKC, GSK-3?, and HDAC6; 3) defining SMase activation in vesicle transport pathways and their function for ceramide flux to the cilium; 4) identifying proteins and protein domains that associate with ceramide; 5) determining that transport and activation of signaling proteins in cilia, in particular of the sonic hedgehog pathway, are regulated by ceramide; and 6) defining a mechanism by which ceramide regulates astrocyte activation and ependymal cell- driven CSF flow. The impact of this project is on defining a fundamental and novel mechanism in basic neuroscience and membrane biology, which has broad implications for our understanding of the regulation of cilia by lipid-protein interaction and the importance of this regulation for the function of astrocytes and ependymal cells during brain development and aging. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that ceramide stabilizes cilia in astrocytes and ependymal cells. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ceramide regulates IFT and receptor activation in cilia. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that ciliogenic ceramide regulates astrocyte and ependymal cell function."

"9133065","PROJECT SUMMARY Autism and spectrum disorders (ASD) are serious and debilitating neurodevelopmental disorders that incur substantial suffering for patients and major challenges to our health care system. It is now estimated that ASD affects about 1 in 68 children, with a male:female ratio of 4:1. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to ASD, but environmental factors have been understudied. Because environmental factors are potentially modifiable they should be a research priority. This effort has been hampered by the challenges of acquiring accurate and relevant exposure measures in large, unbiased, epidemiologic cohorts. Among the many environmental exposures to which humans are exposed, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDs) have perhaps the best-known effects on neurodevelopment in pediatric populations. Several of these chemicals, particularly when exposure is prenatal, have been linked to autism-related phenotypes, and sex- differences in these associations have been documented. EDs have been shown to affect GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, which have prominent roles in ASD. Therefore, EDs are promising candidates as environmental triggers for ASD. To our knowledge, no prior study has been able to robustly link prenatal ED exposure to ASD. The goal of this application is to determine whether prenatal exposure to five classes of EDs impacts ASD risk. To achieve this, we will use stored samples from a serum biobank in southern Sweden and link these to population-based registries that include individual-level perinatal, diagnostic, medical, and demographic information (117,318 births in the years 1998-2007). We will randomly select and validate 600 ASD cases (oversampling females to include 200 females, 400 males) and 600 controls with similar sex and birth year distributions. By measuring concentrations of 38 EDs in five chemical classes in maternal serum samples we will address the following three integrated specific aims: First, determine the associations between ASD risk and prenatal serum concentration of our target EDs and their mixtures; Second, determine whether gender modifies sensitivity to prenatal ED exposure resulting in sex-dimorphic ED-ASD associations; Third, determine whether concentrations of EDs, singly and in combination, contribute to differences in ASD phenotype and their severity."
"9256807","Project Summary Obesity is a global epidemic that is linked to a number of devastating diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Studies of obesity and adipose tissue function can help us comprehend these diseases and identify possible strategies to prevent them. Thermogenic adipocytes are a type of fat cell that upregulates a thermogenic program in response to cold stimuli. This upregulation of the thermogenic program causes adipocytes to disperse energy as heat, as opposed to storing it. Thermogenic adipocytes recently have been identified in adult humans, and studies have shown that active thermogenic adipocytes in humans are correlated with improved metabolic parameters, suggesting that these cells are a promising target for diabetes and obesity therapies. My preliminary data show that treatment of adipocytes with the transient receptor potential cation channel A1 (TRPA1) agonists cinnamaldehyde (CA) and allyl isothiosyanate (AITC) increases thermogenic gene expression. I hypothesize that TRPA1 mediates a thermogenic response in adipocytes and that TRPA1 agonism will improve cold tolerance and counteract obesity. I propose to study the thermogenesis- associated changes in mouse and human thermogenic adipocytes in response to TRPA1 activation and the effect that TRPA1 agonism or knockout has on regulating thermogenesis and glucose metabolism in vivo. Aim 1: To characterize the mechanisms by which TRPA1 mediates regulation of thermogenesis at the cellular level. My preliminary data have shown that both mouse and human subcutaneous adipocytes upregulate thermogenic gene expression in response to treatment with the TRPA1 agonists CA and AITC. Additionally, both mouse and human subcutaneous cells upregulate thermogenic gene expression in response to cold exposure. In this aim I will characterize the mechanisms by which TRPA1 agonism upregulates thermogenesis in fat cells by investigating the role that TRPA1 agonism plays in regulating both mitochondrial function and lipolysis. Aim 2: To determine the role that TRPA1 plays in regulating whole-body metabolism. Past studies have shown that inducing thermogenesis in thermogenic fat can counteract obesity and improve glucose metabolism. In this aim I will use mouse models to investigate the role that TRPA1 knockout or agonism has on regulating the thermogenic response to cold and improving glucose metabolism by studying the effects that TRPA1 agonist oral gavage has on regulating thermogenesis in fat tissue and in counteracting high fat diet induced obesity."
"9330505","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is sequentially cleaved by ß- and ?-secretases to generate amyloid ß-peptide (Aß) in the brain - a central player in Alzheimer's disease. APP cleavage by ß-secretase-1 (BACE-1) is the rate-limiting step for production of Aß. Aß is believed to exert its toxicity on neurons while in a soluble and oligomeric state, prior to deposition as insoluble fibrils in brain. Thus, for reasons related to bth pathophysiology and therapeutics, understanding mechanisms and pathways of Aß generation from APP is a major focus of many laboratories. An intriguing aspect of Aß production is that its release is dependent upon neuronal activity - enhanced synaptic activity results in more Aß release. Though pathways involved in trafficking and cleavage of APP in neurons are of obvious importance, the vast majority of previous studies on APP/BACE-1 trafficking have been carried out in non-neuronal cells. These findings may not always be applicable to neurons, which are highly polarized and are known to have very different trafficking mechanisms. Furthermore, inferences on how neuronal activity modulates APP processing by BACE-1 require work in neurons. The prevailing view is that at presynaptic terminals, heightened synaptic vesicle recycling that accompanies high synaptic activity results in increased internalization into endosomes of APP where proteolysis by secretases take place. However, our recent studies using live neuronal imaging showed rather surprising results in that APP and BACE-1 normally traffic in distinct vesicles - perhaps preventing unabated cleavage - but converge in dendrites upon activity-induction. This led us to propose a new model whereby neuronal activity brings together APP and BACE-1 in dendrites where the two molecules interact. Only subsequently are these two molecules sorted into axons to distal terminals. Experiments in this proposal will examine a number of predictions that emanate from this working model and dissect the trafficking pathways of APP and BACE-1; revealing their relationship to amyloidogenesis and neuronal activity. Four Aims are proposed: 1) Test the hypothesis that APP and BACE-1 are first conveyed into dendrites in distinct carriers after biogenesis. 2) Determine specific neuronal subcellular site(s) of APP/BACE-1 interaction and Aß release. 3) Determine the biogenesis and molecular composition of the axonal APP/BACE-1-carrying organelle. 4) Visualize APP/BACE-1 associations in brains and in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Collectively, results from these studies will provide new insights into the trafficking pathways of APP and BACE-1 and demonstrate how neuronal activity modulates these pathways to enhance APP cleavage and Aß release."
"9206965","The implementation science literature underscores the challenges associated with moving research to routine practice, and acknowledges the importance of building the literature base to facilitate scale-up of evidence- based practices. In our proposed U19, our interdisciplinary research team is committed to working with HIV+ youth and youth at risk of infection to improve their health and well-being and to develop the IS field by employing three types of effectiveness-implementation hybrid designs, all addressing self-management: 1) a Type 1 design (Belzer and Brown) in which the primary aim is to determine the effectiveness of clinical intervention with a secondary aim to better understand the context for implementation; 2) a Type 2 design (Parsons) in which the primary aims are to determine both the effectiveness of the clinical intervention and the feasibility and utility of an implementation strategy; and 3) a Type 3 design (Naar), in which the primary aim is to determine the utility of an implementation strategy with a secondary aim on assessing effectiveness on cascade-related outcomes. Consistent with our overall goal of advancing implementation science, our team has established an Implementation Science Core (ISC) to maximize efficiencies across projects and has adopted an implementation conceptual model, Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment (EPIS), to ground implementation planning, research, and measurement across the studies. In particular, the Research Projects will examine EPIS inner and outer context factors across phases?from exploring ways to improve fit to characteristics that may influence active implementation, such as the sociopolitical context, leadership, facilitator attitudes toward evidence-based practices, fiscal viability, and acceptability and feasibility of interventions. Specifically, the ISC will: (1) facilitate and support a unified approach to implementation science research particularly as it applies to self-management by HIV+ or at risk youth; (2) provide resources to support early career and other investigators in the newly developed ATN4 with implementation science issues related to their studies; and (3) increase dissemination of interventions, support materials, and implementation study findings relevant to adolescent HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. The inclusion of the ISC provides an opportunity for synergy across Research Projects to systematically expand the implementation science research related to youth HIV self-management interventions, a contribution to field and to those looking towards avenues of scaling up such interventions."
"9267191","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal structural and functional connectivity (interaction between brain regions) is central to the pathophysiology of psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Modern neuroimaging techniques and analytic strategies provide an unprecedented capacity to more fully characterize the functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Individuals with psychotic illness and their unaffected relatives have abnormal connectivity, suggesting that at least a portion of psychotic disconnectivity is associated with genetic predisposition for the diseases. Imaging-based connectivity endophenotypes are ideally suited to aid the functional characterization of putative risk genes, allowing us to move beyond a genotype-phenotype association to delineating mechanisms that give rise to psychotic illnesses. Recently, large-scale exome sequencing in individuals of European ancestry provided the strongest evidence to date for specific genetic variants that increase risk for psychosis. These primarily rare mutations were spread across gene networks involved in neuronal processes, including calcium channels and postsynaptic signaling. Our goals are to replicate these promising genetic findings in a different ethnic group, African-Americans, and determine whether and how these gene sets impact psychotic disconnectivity. African-Americans, an underserved population, have ~32% more highly deleterious non-synonymous rare variants in these networks than individuals of European ancestry, improving our power to detect rare variants. Our aims are to: (1) use modern MRI acquisition and analysis techniques based on the Human Connectome Project to document psychotic disconnectivity in 750 African Americans (375 with a psychotic disorder and 375 demographically matched comparison subjects). We will test hypotheses that diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis are associated with reduced global functional connectivity but intact global structural connectivity, combined with aberrant connectivity between specific regions or tracts; (2) conduct whole exome sequencing (WES) to test the influence of rare non-synonymous variants from genes in previously identified gene sets on psychosis risk using a network-centered analysis strategy. We will test hypotheses that the voltage-gated calcium ion channel, and the ARC-associated scaffold protein and the NMDAR postsynaptic signaling complexes influence diagnostic and dimensional indices of psychosis; and (3) apply this same network-centric test to determine if gene sets implicated in illness risk also influence functional and structural psychotic disconnectivity. Linking these genetic pathways to psychotic disconnectivity will provide mechanistic insights into the genomic influences on psychotic illness. Our collaborative application includes sites at Yale/Hartford Hospital (DC Glahn PI), Stanford (RA Poldrack PI) and Texas Biomedical Research Institute (J Blangero PI). Our results should bolster our understanding of the genetic architecture of psychotic illness and provide important clues for traversing the chasm between identified genetic networks and the behaviorally defined disorder."
"9242212","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system."
"9074407","ABSTRACT  Despite more than three decades of intensive effort, currently no effective anti-RAS therapies have reached  clinical application. The history of anti-RAS drug discovery has been marked by missteps and mistakes, due in  large part to our incomplete understanding of the full complexities of RAS. There remain many perplexing  issues that until recently have been ignored by the field. We argue that if these issues remain unresolved, this  will compromise the success of anti-RAS drug discovery. In Project 1, we challenge the perception that ?all  RAS mutations are created equal?. Our studies focus on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), arguably  the human cancer most addicted to mutant KRAS, to pursue three key issues. First, there is the still-prevalent  assumption that the highly related RAS proteins (HRAS, KRAS 4A/4B and NRAS) are largely functionally  equivalent proteins. Therefore, it is perplexing why there is exclusive mutation of KRAS in PDAC. Does this  simply reflect the inability of carcinogenic assault to cause mutational activation of HRAS and NRAS in PDAC?  Or alternatively and more provocatively ? despite their significant functional similarities, do mutant HRAS and  NRAS not have the capability to drive tumor initiation and progression in the pancreas? Second, a survey of  all cancers finds that there are 134 distinct cancer-associated missense mutations found in KRAS, with 99% at  one of three mutational hotspots (G12, G13 and Q61) ? do they all cause equivalent perturbations in protein  function and have equivalent capabilities to drive cancer development? In PDAC, there is a near-exclusive  occurrence of G12 mutations, with G13 and Q61 mutations rare ? does this simply reflect DNA mutation  frequencies or do G12 mutations cause distinct perturbations that favor their presence in PDAC? Finally, while  there are six possible single base change missense mutations at each hotspot, the frequencies are not  uniform, and can exhibit striking cancer-type differences. Do the different amino acid substitutions at each  hotspot cause distinct perturbations in protein function that then translate to different capabilities to drive  cancer development? We propose three aims that will provide further clarity for these three issues. We will  determine if: (1) KRAS G12R is distinct among G12 mutations and exhibits mutation-specific regulation and  effector dependencies and driver functions in PDAC; (2) there is a biological basis for why KRAS G13  mutations are rare in PDAC; and (3) KRAS Q61 mutants are biochemically and biologically distinct from KRAS  G12 and G13 mutants and have distinct consequences for KRAS protein function in PDAC. We propose that  ?all RAS mutations are NOT created equal? and that mutation-specific biochemical and/or signaling properties  can be exploited for mutation-selective therapeutic strategies. Project 1 studies are tightly interrelated and  highly synergistic with Projects 2-4, in both scientific themes and experimental strategies.   "
"9193140","Consortium for large-scale production and phenotyping of knockout mice (UM1) ABSTRACT: The long-term goal of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) is to develop a resource of targeted mutations in mice for every protein-coding gene in the mammalian genome that the research community can use to elucidate gene function in human biology and disease. We have formed a consortium of two Institutes (Baylor College of Medicine and MRC Harwell). This application describes our plan to generate null alleles for 1500 mouse genes using CRISPR/RGN genome editing technology and validate each line using established QC procedures. We will cryopreserve all mutant strains and deliver germplasm to the MMRRC repositories. These mutant alleles represent a gold standard resource of mutant alleles for the wider community, and an important foundation for future research and translational studies using the mouse models created. We will perform broad-based adult phenotyping on all mutant lines, and for the first time incorporate an ageing component for a significant fraction of mutants, the latter involving an additional testing component from 12 months onwards. We will also assess homozygous lethal and subviable lines in an embryonic phenotyping pipeline, It is apparent that there is a relationship of mouse lethal (essential) and subviable genes with human disease loci. All allele and phenotype data will be submitted in real time to the Data Coordination Center, ensuring that all of the BasH data is disseminated to the wider biomedical scientific community. We will continue our R&D program to introduce appropriate methodological and technological developments from production to phenotyping. BasH will continue to pilot improvements in Cas9 RGN for the production of more sophisticated alleles, and in parallel ensure that developments in cryopreservation approaches at Baylor and Harwell are integrated into the production pipeline. We will also continue our major projects in improving and enriching the adult and embryo phenotyping pipelines, focusing on areas such as metabolomics, behavioral phenotyping and home cage monitoring, with the aim of providing more complex and longitudinal data. Baylor College of Medicine and MRC Harwell have the established expertise, experience, and resources to efficiently and cost-effectively meet this goal."
"9307019","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant proposal is to perform a clinical study which will allow the first foldable and injectable artificial cornea, the KeraKlear, to be used in the United States market for treatment of corneal blindness. This device may be implanted through an incision size that is approximately 1/10th the size of the incision that is required for the most popular artificial cornea available in the U.S. The smaller incision size is expected to allow a much quicker surgery for patients and a more accelerated recovery as compared to the currently available artificial corneas. In addition, the KeraKlear artificial cornea may be implanted in many patients with cornea blindness without penetration into the anterior chamber. This avoids two of the most serious complications of artificial cornea implantation including internal infection of the eye (endophthalmitis) and severe bleeding (expulsive hemorrhage). The use of the KeraKlear artificial cornea also avoids the common complications of corneal transplantation including high astigmatism, corneal graft failure and corneal graft rejection. Finally, the KeraKlear would enable the treatment of cornea blindness in a much larger number of patients. Currently, corneal transplantation is limited to about 100,000 per year worldwide because of the lack of suitable donor corneas. This represents only 1% of the 10 million people worldwide who have cornea blindness in both eyes. By making the KeraKlear artificial cornea available a significantly larger percentage of the cornea blind patients around the world could be treated."
"8998776","Natural killer (NK) cells are a major lineage of human lymphocytes with vital functions in innate immunity,  adaptive immunity and hematopoietic cell transplantation. These functions are mediated by the diverse  interactions of highly polymorphic HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules with equally polymorphic killer immunoglobulin-  like receptors (KIR). They are complemented by the conserved interactions of HLA-E with CD94:NKG2  heterodimers. The genes encoding KIR receptors and HLA ligands segregate independently, thereby  generating unique and diverse genotypes within families and populations. Phenotypically, this produces  functionally distinct NK-cell repertoires, a natural variation that has profound effects on susceptibility to  infection and autoimmunity, on reproductive success, and the outcome of HCT. In SA1 we will extend  retrospective statistical analyses of KIR and HLA variation in HCT to the highest levels of allele-level resolution  and precision. We have developed a novel target capture and next-generation sequencing methodology with  compatible bioinformatics tools. These will be used to determine complete KIR haplotype sequences and  define allelic and allotypic variation throughout the KIR locus. In SA2 we will perform high-resolution analysis of  immune reconstitution following HCT. Three cohorts will be studied -- HLA-matched, HLA-mismatched, and  HLA-haploidentical transplants ? by comparing the mature NK cells of the donor to the reconstituting NK cells  in the transplant recipient. Longitudinal differences in immune phenotype will be assessed and compared.  Functional capacity of the NK cells will be tested by challenge with target cells expressing self, altered-self,  non-self and missing-self HLA class I. Early, intermediate and late stages in immune system reconstitution will  be evaluated. We will assess the reconstituted NK-cell response to exogenous stimuli (the CD16 directed-  BiKEs and IL-15/IL-15R?-Fc superagonist complexes also studied in Projects 2 and 3) at the different stages.  All analyses will consider KIR and HLA genotypes and CMV status. NK cells mature to acquire functional  immunity through a process called education. SA3 of this project will analyze mature, educated NK cells and  determine their functional capacity to recognize and respond to target cells expressing self, non-self, altered-  self, and missing-self HLA class I. To achieve this goal, we will develop a high-throughput assay to assess NK-  cell responses to an extensive cell panel, in which each member cell expresses a different HLA class I  allotype. From these data, predictive rules for education, based on the KIR and HLA genotype and CMV status  of individuals, will be defined. Mass cytometry will be used to analyze NK cells and other lymphocyte  subpopulations for individuals with selected combinations of KIR, HLA and CMV status. The results from this  project will exponentially increase knowledge of the genetic factors influencing the outcome of HCT. Our long-  term goal is to obtain complete immunogenetic and biological understanding of the parameters affecting NK  cell education. This knowledge should inform a wide range of studies aimed at improving human health.   "

In 2013 NaRCAD initiated an AHRQ-supported annual conference series to allow the sharing of knowledge and help guide and improve the field within the evolving health care landscape . We propose to improve and expand this conference series with annual meetings from 2016 through 2018 to focus on enhancing the impact of academic detailing on health care improvement initiatives. In hosting these conferences we will continue to provide a forum for the community of professionals working on academic detailing and clinical outreach education to the US health care community. The annual sessions showcase best practices in academic detailing and raise the visibility of the role of academic detailing in quality improvement. The conference series also sustain and expand NaRCAD's network of academic detailing programs, allowing for further The conferences feature a mix of formal plenary presentations from leaders in the field with discussion and breakout sessions that provide ample time for interaction; both session types will address the current state of knowledge, share best practices and identify emerging issues in the field. Organizations and individuals will be able to submit their work for presentation at the conference sessions. growth of this important approach.  The conferences will be valuable for a wide variety of stakeholders who will participate, including public and private organizations using academic detailing, Medicaid agencies, policymakers, public health agencies, academics, insurers, non-profits interested in health care improvement and consumers. The conference proceedings will serve as educational materials for the greater academic detailing community in the US. Materials from the conference, as well as professionally prepared video presentations, will be freely available online in our Resource & Learning Center after the conference, serving as long-standing resources as well as promotional items. As the only established meeting of both national and international academic detailing organizations, our continued conference series helps strengthen academic detailing practice and improve healthcare quality. Ultimately, the sharing, deliberations and lessons from these meetings lead to practice changes for academic detailing worldwide and improve the readiness of the healthcare system to enact change."
"9143988","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Precise timing of ovulation is required for reproductive success. Ovulation is triggered when estradiol switches from negative feedback action on the pituitary and hypothalamus to positive feedback, initiating a surge of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion that causes a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) release, which triggers ovulation. Our understanding of the neurobiological changes underlying the switch from negative to positive feedback is incomplete. High levels of estradiol are essential and, in both humans and rodents, the LH surge tends to occur at a specific time of day. GnRH neurons, however, do not express the estrogen receptor required for feedback, thus estradiol-sensitive afferents likely convey estradiol information to GnRH neurons. Likewise, time-of-day information is relayed directly or indirectly from the central mammalian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Our working hypothesis is that GnRH neurons switch from negative to positive feedback by integrating multiple changes to their synaptic inputs and intrinsic properties. To test this hypothesis, we will use three separate approaches in three aims. In Aim1, we will test the hypothesis that SCN neuromodulator vasoactive intestinal peptide acts directly on GnRH neurons to change intrinsic properties resulting in increased action potential firing rate. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that changes to transcription and translation occur during the transition from negative to positive feedback. To test this, we will use isolate mRNA transcripts bound to GFP-tagged ribosomal subunits that are targeted to GnRH neurons using cre recombinase under the control of the GnRH promoter. This will allow us to profile the entire transcriptome during this feedback transition. The differences we observe may have a role in modifying intrinsic properties that mediate the switch. In Aim 3, we will develop a mathematical model of a GnRH neuron that incorporates all the individual changes to intrinsic properties and synaptic transmission observed in the literature and in Aims 1 and 2. While electrophysiological experiments are limited to manipulating one or two variables at a time, mathematical models have the advantage of being able to integrate and simultaneously manipulate all variables. By iteratively adjusting conductances, we will be able to predict which combination or combinations of properties reproduce the switch from negative to positive feedback. This model will generate testable hypotheses. Our long-term goal is to advance the fundamental understanding of the signals required for neural control of ovulation, and how perturbations to this system lead to infertility. The mathematical models we develop here to integrate estradiol and SCN signals will help us to devise protocols to understand the integration of other signals, such as metabolism, into reproductive function. Furthermore, this research will train me in RNA isolation and profiling electrophysiological techniques and hypothesis generation using mathematical modeling. This training is essential for my evolution into an independent wet and dry lab physician scientist."
"9225456","PROJECT SUMMARY    Advancing age is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) due largely to adverse changes to  arteries. A major feature of arterial aging is the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction as assessed  by a decline in endothelium-­dependent dilation (EDD). Impaired EDD with advancing age is caused by reduced  bioavailability of the vasodilatory and vascular protective molecule nitric oxide (NO), secondary to oxidative  stress. A major contributor to age-­associated vascular oxidative stress is excessive production of mitochondrial  reactive oxygen species (mtROS).  As such, therapies that reduce mtROS may improve vascular endothelial  function and decrease CVD risk in middle-­aged/older (MA/O) adults.  Mitoquinone (MitoQ) is a mitochondria-­targeted antioxidant that, in contrast to traditional exogenous  antioxidants, accumulates at levels 100-­1,000-­fold higher in the mitochondria vs. cytosol of cells, and reduces  mtROS-­mediated oxidative stress in vivo. Preclinical findings from our lab indicate that 4 weeks of MitoQ  supplementation in the drinking water completely restores NO-­mediated EDD in old (26-­28 mo) mice, and  reverses the age-­related increases in aortic mitochondrial superoxide production and oxidative stress. The goal  of the current study is to translate our preclinical findings to MA/O adults. We propose a randomized,  double-­blind, placebo-­controlled cross-­over pilot study to provide the first evidence for the efficacy of  oral MitoQ supplementation to improve NO-­mediated EDD in healthy MA/O adults (60-­79 yr;? n=21) with  baseline endothelial dysfunction. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which MitoQ may improve EDD in this  group, we will employ innovative translational techniques to assess endothelial cell mtROS production,  mtROS-­mediated suppression of EDD, and systemic and/or vascular endothelial cell markers of mitochondrial  function, oxidative stress, and inflammation.   Hypothesis 1: 6 weeks of oral MitoQ supplementation will increase NO-­mediated EDD in MA/O adults.  Hypothesis 2: Improved EDD with MitoQ treatment will be mediated by reduced endothelial cell mtROS  production and mtROS-­related suppression of EDD, and will be associated with decreased vascular  endothelial and systemic oxidative stress.   This investigation will combine clinically relevant functional assessments with innovative mechanistic  analyses to investigate a novel intervention approach for reducing mitochondria-­derived oxidative stress  and improving NO-­mediated EDD in MA/O adults with endothelial dysfunction, but free of clinical disease.    "
"9072858","ABSTRACT  Pathway analysis of genomic data?the use of prior knowledge about how genes function together in biological  systems?plays an increasingly critical role in gaining biological insights from large-scale genomic studies, and  particularly in cancer research. However, even the richest source of computer-accessible biological pathway  information, the Gene Ontology (GO), is very incomplete, hampering pathway analyses. Over the past three  years, the GO Consortium has developed a project that has shown that, by utilizing a rigorous phylogenetic  approach, we can increase the amount of knowledge for human genes by five-fold through careful use of  experimental data obtained in model organisms such as the mouse, fruit fly, and yeast. The GOC project,  however, relies on expert human biologists, and will not scale to the entire human genome. Here, we propose  to develop a computational approach that leverages the experience gained in the GOC project. We will  develop an accurate, scalable computational solution to the gene function inference problem, which will  dramatically increase the amount of biological information that can be used in analysis of genome-scale human  datasets. In brief, the task is to integrate knowledge obtained from experiments across multiple organisms, in  the context of the family tree that relates the genes, by constructing a probabilistic model of function  conservation and divergence. The main application of the probabilistic model will be to infer the function of  human genes, from experiments in other organisms. While each gene family will have a specific model  depending on its own, unique history, to avoid overfitting we will estimate only a small number of parameters  that are shared across all families. We propose to use the same, rigorous model of functional evolution as  employed in the GOC project, which is based on evolutionary gain and loss of different kinds of functions (e.g.  a catalytic function, binding function or even participation in a biological process or pathway), using not only  GO annotations but additional information such as protein domain structure and active sites. We will use the  manually-curated examples from the GO Consortium as a training set for developing, as well as a test set for  assessing, our computational inference method. We expect that this work will result in a dramatic increase in  the number of GO annotations for human genes, resulting in much more informative results from pathway  analysis, thus generating additional insights into human disease risk, progression and potential therapies.  While our approach is general, we will focus manual validation on cancer-related pathways in order to ensure  applicability specifically in cancer research."
"9029985","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia is a developmental disorder of vision that affects 3-5% of children in the US. The goals of our work are to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the visual deficits and to evaluate specific hypotheses for the neural disorder. We study a nonhuman primate model for the human visual system so that we can directly assess the neural correlates of developmental visual disability without compromising the visual welfare of any child. The proposed work aims to evaluate the neural disorder of amblyopia with a series of matched behavioral and neurophysiological studies. Since amblyopia is predominantly a disorder of spatial vision, we plan to target the ventral visual cortical pathway. The framework for the research is to contrast two mechanistic hypotheses: 1) amblyopia is a disorder arising primarily at the first stages of cortical processing that is then passed along through subsequent levels of processing, essentially unmodified, or 2) amblyopia results from a cascade of deficits that emerge from a series of changes in cortical processing as signals traverse the ventral pathway. The planned experiments will directly evaluate neural activity as it relates to amblyopic performance deficits in ventral stream cortical areas V1, V2, and V4. We will use tasks ranging from low-level to higher-order to capture the range of individual losses in these three areas: Monocular and dichoptic contrast masking, second order contrast discrimination, naturalistic texture discrimination, and Gabor contour integration, as well as basic characterization of the first-order spatial deficit. The same stimuli will be employed for behavioral and neurophysiological testing in individual subjects. The recordings will be conducted in awake, behaving amblyopes with multi-electrode Utah arrays placed in the three ventral stream areas simultaneously. The goal is to record single and multi-unit activity simultaneously in foveal representations of the three target visual areas; we will also separately assess responses in the parafoveal visual field representation of V4. We will use population decoding and correlational analyses to compare behavioral performance and neural activity between the eyes of amblyopes, between amblyopes and controls, between different visual areas, and across specific visual tasks. The results will be used to evaluate and refine the current views on the neural disorder in amblyopia. In addition, we will learn about the neural mechanisms underlying form perception in normal individuals. Our research will ultimately inform efforts to treat and prevent amblyopia development in children."
"9222109","Project Summary Epilepsy is one of the leading neurological disorders in the United States, affecting more than 479,000 children and over 2 million adults. Approximately 30% of epileptic patients have poor seizure control despite antiepileptic medications and are potential candidates for neurosurgical intervention. Early identification and referral of children who are potential surgical candidates is complex and while relevant guidelines exist, there is no standard process to efficiently identify those patients meeting criteria for neurosurgical intervention. Given the large corpus of note-based data available in the electronic health record (EHR), it is challenging for providers to efficiently retain and process all the pertinent patient information. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been successfully used to evaluate clinical notes and make recommendations in the research setting. However, NLP techniques are rarely integrated into practice to provide real-time clinical decision support. We developed and retrospectively evaluated a NLP system to help identify those patients who meet neurosurgical criteria and therefore enable surgical consults and evaluations to occur sooner. Knowing clinical decision support can improve outcomes of care, our proposed research will implement NLP into clinical practice and develop a decision support mechanism to improve the time to surgery for eligible patients. The objective of this project is to implement NLP directly into clinical care and determine the most effective decision support mechanism for provider adherence to epilepsy surgical consult recommendations. The long- term goal of this project is to reduce the time to initial surgery evaluation for patients with intractable epilepsy by integrating NLP-classification criteria into clinical practice. This project is one of the first in the field to study the integration of NLP recommendations into clinical care. We will use a human factors engineering framework to design and to analyze two different alerting methodologies for the best-fit for clinical workflow to produce the optimum provider adherence while reducing alert fatigue. Epilepsy progress notes can be classified across hospitals, and if successful, the system will be implemented in additional pediatric institutions around the United States."
"9203373","Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions of old age, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment. In this application, we propose to investigate the role of aging in the development of SVD in a mouse model of CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), the most common genetic form of cerebral SVD. CADASIL is caused by dominant mutations involving cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the Notch 3 receptor, and is characterized by progressive degeneration smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the small penetrating arteries of the brain and accumulation of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) in vessel walls. CADASIL patients start suffering recurrent ischemic strokes in their thirties or forties, and progressive cognitive impairment and dementia starting in their fifties or sixties. Based on the observations that: 1) patients with loss-of-function Notch 3 mutations do not have overt vascular developmental abnormalities, and 2) heterozygous patients develop SVD much later in life than homozygous patients, we hypothesize that the requirements for Notch 3 signaling are higher in old age than during development or at younger ages. Therefore, it seems likely that aging will influence experimental outcomes related to Notch 3 signaling manipulation, and that older mice will be better models to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking Notch 3 signaling to SVD. In order to study this, we propose to test the hypothesis that the impact of manipulating Notch 3 signaling on SVD-relevant phenotypes in mice will change with age. In order to test our hypothesis, we will utilize mice that we generated and characterized in previous publications (Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2008; Arboleda-Velasquez et al., 2011), including a Notch 3 knockout and two knockin models that allow inducible expression of either wild type human Notch 3 or human Notch 3 carrying the C455R CADASIL mutation, which lies in the Notch 3 ligand binding domain (LBD) (Arboleda- Velasquez et al., 2002). Our analyses of these model mice show that the C455R mutation impairs signaling in vitro and in vivo, leads to a robust SMC pathology, and (like other published CADASIL mutations located in the LBD, C428S) displays dominant-negative properties. In the UH2 phase of the project, we plan to: 1) breed mice carrying Notch 3 mutations and age them out to 24 months for use in the UH3 phase of the project and 2) determine feasibility by examining Notch 3 transgene expression in vessels of aged mice. During the UH3 phase of the project, we propose the following experimental goals: 1) to examine how age affects the impact of manipulating Notch 3 signaling on SVD by monitoring the progression of SVD phenotypes and changes in SMC gene expression in aged and young wildtype and Notch 3 mutant mice; and 2) to monitor the ability of an inducible wildtype human Notch 3 transgene to rescue SVD phenotypes as mice age. Ultimately, these studies are designed to establish whether old mice carrying mutations in Notch 3 are a more appropriate model to study SVD and whether the impact of manipulating Notch 3 signaling on SVD-relevant phenotypes in mice will change with age."
"9353043","Elucidation of the decades? long period of time during which Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies begin to develop prior to the appearance of cognitive symptoms (i.e., ?preclinical? AD) has been largely driven by the study of disease biomarkers. Such biomarkers are now being used to more precisely define various stages within this preclinical period in order to better understand the pathologic processes taking place during this early stage and to better inform the design and interpretation of prevention trials aimed at identifying diseasemodifying therapies that have the best chance of preserving normal cognitive function. Data from ACS Project 2 contributed to the finding that preclinical AD (defined by CSF biomarkers) in older individuals (? 65 yrs) increases the risk for developing symptomatic AD in a stage-dependent manner. In addition, changes in amyloid-related markers (Aß42) over time were observed in early middle-aged participants (45-64 yrs), whereas changes in tau and ptau181 were observed in those in mid middle-age (55-64 yrs) and coincided with initial declines in cognition. As the current ACS cohort is aging, we are now poised to evaluate biomarker trajectories in individuals as they progress from being biomarker-negative to biomarker-positive (preclinical AD) to cognitively impaired (symptomatic AD). The proposed experiments are designed to evaluate the utility of CSF markers for identifying those individuals with preclinical AD who are in the transition period from cognitive normality to impairment. Novel markers of synaptic dysfunction will be evaluated in addition to the traditional markers of core AD pathologies. CSF tau and ptau181 will be compared with tau PET imaging to validate their utility as presumed markers of neurofibrillary tangles. Finally, in an exploratory aim, we will utilize the innovative method of Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK) pioneered by Dr. Randall Bateman to evaluate the potential of a plasma (and CSF) Aß kinetic measure as an indicator of brain amyloid pathology. Aim 1. Continue to measure CSF concentrations of Aß40, Aß42, tau, ptau181, YKL-40, and VILIP-1, as well as novel markers of synaptic dysfunction, Neurogranin and SNAP-25. Aim 2. In longitudinal analyses, assess the annual rate of change in CSF biomarker concentrations as a function of AD risk (age, family history, APOE?4 status) and their relationships with baseline and future rates of change in other CSF markers. Aim 3. Correlate fluid biomarker measures (and rate of change over time) with clinical and psychometric performance (Clinical Core), novel tau imaging as assessed by T807 PET (Project 1), attentional control measures (Project 3), and structural neuroimaging (via MRI) and amyloid PET (via florbetapir) (Project 4).

"9029742","Project Summary  Over the past decade, we have been building, parsing and wrangling systems for extracting neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment biomarkers from high-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) imagery at 1 mm3 scale which are discriminating. At the same time, large and complex data sets and networks of segmented structures are becoming increasingly available to the research community such as Predict-HD, Track-HD, ADNI, and SchizConnect. Neuroscientists and clinicians are interested in tracking biomarkers which characterize rates of atrophy in anatomical networks, onset of or changepoint times of spread through the networks, and prediction of risk to conversion as determined by clinical symptoms. These wrangling and modeling methods are novel. Our biomarkers are extracted via brain mapping technologies based on diffeomorphometry, the study of morphological change via diffeomorphic tracking of anatomical coordinate systems at the sub millimeter scale. Like stereology, diffeomorphometry discovers high-dimensional features signalling neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment via tight integration of random field based statistical methods via large deviation empirical probability estimators calculated via high-dimensional permutation testing. Family-wise rates are calculated for group comparisons, and have been advanced changepoint modelling allowing us to explicitly estimate the spread of progression of anatomical feature change through the networked structures associated to neurodegeneration - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Huntingdon's Disease (HD) and neurodevelopment - Schizophrenia (SZ) and Attention Deficit and Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). These tools will be disseminated and tested via MriCloud.  We will perform three specific aims. Aim 1 will use our MriCloud architecture to deploy a Multi-Atlas Brain Mapping module for mapping an ontology of approximately 400 structures to T1 and DTI data. The architecture will support many atlases which are matched across a broad range of age from pediatric to geriatric groups, and as well as several diseases. Aim 2 will deploy a Statistical Shape Diffeomorphometry module consisting of pipelines for a) generating templates of structures from populations of cross-sectional datasets, b) data reduction to templates for cross-sectional and longitudinal geodesic mappings, and c) multiple hypothesis testing procedures based on vertex, Laplace-Beltrami basis functions and PCA basis functions. Users with their own ontology definitions of the subcortical structures will be able to generate population templates and visualize the statistics in template coordinates. Aim 3 will generate a webportal for users to use modules from Aims 1 and 2 to examine abnormalities in networks of structures such as the striatum, thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus."
"9353945","Efforts to predict corneal ectasia risk secondary to keratoconus or refractive surgery will be greatly facilitated if the measures of corneal biomechanical properties are made available in vivo to improve current diagnoses based on structural (i.e., topographic and tomographic) evaluations alone. For example, mechanical weaknesses (overall or regional) identified in patients? corneas (with or without topographical abnormalities) could alert physicians to closely monitor the condition and potentially initiate interventions to arrest ectatic progression. Clinically, the ability to acquire spatially resolved biomechanical information is still lacking. Many approaches have been proposed, but they often rely on an external force to deform the cornea in order to induce a mechanical response. In addition, most methods do not explicitly address the influence of the intraocular pressure (IOP) on the measured properties. In this project, we aim to build an ultrasound elastographic technique, termed as the ocular pulse elastography (OPE), to characterize the cornea?s response to the cyclic variation of IOP at each cardiac cycle, i.e., the ocular pulse. The baseline IOP and ocular pulse amplitude, which are all measurable in vivo, will be used in combination with the biomechanical measures from OPE to derive the intrinsic tissue biomechanical properties that are independent of the IOP parameters. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that the OPE technique, based on high frequency ultrasound radiofrequency data analysis, can provide a strain resolution of 0.05% and better, making it possible to reliably measure small in vivo strains induced by an ocular pulse of a few mmHg. In the proposed research, we will (1) validate the OPE technique for mechanical characterization of the cornea; (2) evaluate the sensitivity of OPE in detecting clinically relevant corneal stiffening; (3) define the distribution and variance of OPE-derived corneal stiffness parameters in normal human subjects and their age-associated changes; and (4) test the prediction that corneal biomechanical properties are altered in keratoconus and develop OPE-based biomechanical indices for keratoconus. The first two aims will investigate the relationship between OPE measures and those from traditional mechanical testing, as well as the effects of physiological variables and sensitivity, to build our knowledge of OPE in human eyes under controlled experimental conditions (i.e., in donor eyes) and provide optimal parametric settings and framework for acquiring and interpreting in vivo data. The last two aims of the proposed research will bring the knowledge and technique from the bench to the bedside to acquire in vivo data from normal corneas and those with keratoconus, as the first step of establishing OPE?s clinical use and identifying new, sensitive biomechanical metrics for ectasia risks. The proposed research will address the need for in vivo volumetric biomechanical evaluation of the cornea, leading to a clinical tool for identifying and monitoring biomechanical instability or weakening to aid the diagnosis and treatment of ectatic disease. More broadly, the proposed research will impact the field of ocular biomechanics, by generating in vivo techniques and data to better understand how biomechanics are involved in the health and disease of the eye."

This study plans to roll out in the core area of Shimoga District of Karnataka in the first year to optimize on resources and roll it out to Kerala in secon y ear and Tamil Nadu in the third year. The additions from Kerala and Tamil Nadu would be 200 each. So at the end of 3rd year the intake in the study shall be 800.        Patients and/or parents/guardians will be asked to participate at the time of initial presen tation, after determination by the treating clinician that a Blood profile including Complete Blood Count and Blood Culture as well as for those with neurological syndrome lumbar puncture is clinically indicated for patient management. Hospital laboratories routinely perform Gram stain, glucose/protein levels, cell count, and bacterial culture (where media/reagents are available) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained via lumbar puncture from patients with AFI. This study would look for pathogens by using ELISA based serological tests and subject the specimen to a battery of other tests to lead to pathogen detection.        In our study, clinical samples will be tested for a variety of etiologies associated with AFI such as, Bacterial pathogens (Leptospira, Salmonella, Brucella, Lyme borrelia, S. pneumoniae, H.influenzae, N. meningitidis, Shigella, Campylobacter etc.  ), Rickettsial group of organisms (Scrub typhus, Spotted fever group, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma etc.) and Viruses ( KFD, Dengue, Japanese Encephalitis, West Nile Virus, Chikungunya virus, Tick borne Encephalitis virus, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus, Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Adenovirus, Coronaviruses, Enteroviruses, Diarrhoeagenic viruses etc.) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analyses of patient blood, CSF, Throat swab and Stool samples will be used to identify additional pathogens known to cause Acute febrile illness. Clinical samples also will be tested for unknown pathogens using PCR- sequence based pathogen discovery techniques."
"9120161","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Enormous progress in basic and translational FXS research has allowed identification of neuronal pathway targets for treatment of the underlying disorder. The most well-studied of these has been pharmacological (using mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs)) and genetic reduction of excessive mGluR5 translational pathway signaling to correct abnormal synaptic plasticity, dendritic morphology, cellular signaling, electrophysiological, cognitive, social, behavioral and even growth phenotypes in FXS models. Human early phase trials of mGluR5 NAMs fenobam (Neuropharm), AFQ056 (Novartis) and RO4917523 (Roche) have suggested possible benefit in FXS, but larger phase IIb studies of AFQ056 and RO4917523 failed to meet primary behavioral outcomes in adolescents/adults. These trials may have failed due to lack of measurement of core FXS phenotypes of cognition and learning in a sufficiently young population over a long enough period of time. The proposed project will seek to determine whether the human mGluR5 NAM trials failed because the animal model is not adequate or because the trials were not conducted in a way that benefit could be seen in a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Indeed it may be that the benefits of translational work from preclinical models of NDDs can never be realized via standard drug development pathways. This NeuroNEXT trial seeks to use an innovative exploratory design to change the paradigm for translation of targeted treatments in FXS and determine whether AFQ056 can improve language learning in 100 very young (age 3-6 years) children with FXS during participation in an intensive language learning intervention (LLI), as a surrogate for enhanced neural plasticity. The trial will use a double blind placebo-controlled parallel flexible- dose forced-titration design with a 4 month placebo-lead-in, randomization to AFQ056 or placebo and titration to maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 6 months treatment with AFQ056/placebo combined with the LLI, an open- label extension with re-titration to MTD followed by 6 months of treatment of all participants with LLI and AFQ056, and follow up off AFQ056 at the end of the trial. The study will seek to assess effects of AFQ056 versus placebo on developmental (language, cognitive, adaptive and maladaptive) functioning in young children with FXS receiving the LLI (Aim 1), evaluate safety and tolerability of long-term exposure to AFQ056 in young children with FXS (Aim 2), validate biomarkers that interrogate neural functioning (event-related potentials and eye tracking) and cellular pathway signaling during treatment with AFQ056 and/or LLI and correlate these with developmental outcomes (Aim 3), validate the LLI by evaluating its effects on trajectories of language, cognitive, adaptiv, and maladaptive functioning (Aim 4). If the design is successful, this trial can serve as a model for future trials of mechanistically-targeted treatments operating on neural plasticity in other NDDs, and can accelerate the process of bringing needed treatments to these disorders with high unmet need."
"9163360","Project Summary / Abstract Water fluoridation is a population health intervention used in Canada and the United States to control tooth decay. The safety of administering fluoride via public drinking water is uncertain. Recent human studies suggest that exposure to fluoride in drinking water may alter thyroid function, increase blood lead levels, lower IQ, and increase the risk of developing ADHD. Still, many of the human studies included groups who were exposed to higher levels of fluoride and they often lacked a comparison group or sensitive measures of behavior or learning. Given widespread exposure to fluoridated water, the US National Research Council concluded in a 2007 report that rigorous epidemiological research is urgently needed to address the controversy about the safety of this public health intervention. The aim of this study is to determine if prenatal and childhood exposure to fluoride impacts learning abilities and behavioral problems in young Canadian children, with particular emphasis on vulnerable populations. The present proposal will build upon an exceptional national pregnancy cohort study: ?Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals? (MIREC). The MIREC cohort is ideally suited to address the research objectives because the requisite information (urine during pregnancy and child outcomes) was collected in a large sample that varied as a function of municipal water fluoridation. Fluoride concentrations will be measured using stored urine samples obtained from a sample of 1960 pregnant women living in ten large Canadian cities ? half of which add fluoride to municipal water. Out of 1207 participants who were approached, standardized questionnaires assessing behavioral outcomes are available for 898 children (74% of sample) living in select cities across Canada. In addition, standardized cognitive assessments, or IQ scores, are available for 610 of the children in the birth cohort. The study will also examine whether neurodevelopmental outcomes differ among children who ingested infant formula using fluoridated versus non-fluoridated water. Finally, we will examine whether serial urinary fluoride concentrations in pregnant women are higher in women who live in communities that fluoridate their municipal drinking water. The results of this study will inform public health officials and decision makers about ?real-time? fluoride levels of pregnant women living in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities. It will also provide important information about whether fluoride exposure adversely impacts children?s behaviors or learning abilities. This information will direclty impact decision making concerning the safety of water fluoridation among vulnerable populations and is therefore an area of high"
"9306396","ABSTRACT Asthma and sickle cell disease (SCD) are two chronic conditions associated with increased pediatric mortality, morbidity and health care utilization in the United States. The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), in partnership with the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program (VCHIP), the Pacific Sickle Cell Regional Collaborative (PSCRC) and the California Health Institute has created the ?IMPLEmenting MEasures NeTwork (IMPLEMENT) for Child Health Network?. The IMPLEMENT Network will evaluate, in 10 different states, two sets of quality measures recently developed by the Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) in asthma and SCD. The overarching goal of this project is to rigorously evaluate and refine these PQMP measures so that they can be appropriately applied by practitioners, administrators and purchasers to improve health care quality. Our Specific Aims are (Aim 1) to assess the feasibility of implementing the PQMP measures within the Medicaid patient populations. We will partner with Medicaid or state agencies in 4 states (CA, OR, VT, MA). Feasibility will be based on the measurement burden in implementing the PQMP quality measures and whether significant differences can be measured at the state, health plan or provider level. (Aim 2) We will assess the usability of the PQMP measures in driving and defining quality improvement (QI) goals for asthma (in CA, VT) and for SCD through the Pacific Sickle Cell Regional Collaborative (in CA, OR, NV, AZ, WA, AK, ID,HI). We will use the PQMP measures in pediatric QI collaboratives in a variety of settings. We will define usability as the ability of the PQMP quality measures to (i) help create and identify feasible strategies for improvement; to (ii) help evaluate overall improvement during plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles; and to (iii) be responsive to QI initiatives. (Aim 3), Based on work from Aims 1 and 2, we will promote the dissemination of the PQMP measures by submitting the quality measures that meet endorsement criteria to the National Quality Forum (NQF). To ensure that we have a broad perspective in our evaluation, we have recruited multidisciplinary Advisory Cores that include experts from professional organizations (American Board of Pediatrics), family advocacy groups, QI networks, Medicaid agencies and Accountable Care Organizations. In addition to knowledge about the feasibility and usability of PQMP measures, the IMPLEMENT Network anticipates making several work products publicly available for dissemination as appropriate, which will facilitate the use of the measures submitted. This includes measure ICD10 codes, programming (data preparation and analysis), abstraction tools and updated technical specifications. The completion of the aims listed above by the IMPLEMENT Network will lead to important improvements that can potentially improve pediatric care and outcomes for all children. These measures will help improve the quality of care for pediatric asthma and sickle cell disease, as well as help administrators, payors and consumers identify higher value care, which will lead to a healthier population."
"9137683","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe, rapid-onset disease characterized by a rapid loss in renal function leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Frequent causes of AKI include ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and acute drug or toxicant exposure. Despite attempts to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat AKI, few have been successful, and mortality has remained unchanged for several decades. Therefore, novel targets must be examined for the development of useful therapies for AKI. It has been shown that renal proximal tubule cells exhibit severe mitochondrial dysfunction and depletion of mitochondrial proteins following toxicant exposure or I/R injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to oxidative stress and persistent energy depletion, which exacerbates injury and impairs energy-dependent repair, leading to end organ damage and failure in a variety of tissues. Our laboratory has demonstrated that injured renal proximal tubules can recover if they are induced to generate new mitochondria through mitochondrial biogenesis (MB). In addition, our laboratory has identified several compounds capable of inducing MB in vitro and in in vivo models of AKI. Among these compounds are several b2 adrenergic receptor (b2AR) agonists; however, not all b2AR agonists were found to induce MB. The capacity of these compounds to induce MB biogenesis did not correlate with affinity, but did correlate with the capacity of these compounds to increase levels of cGMP. In turn, cGMP has been shown to induce MB by increasing the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1a (PGC1a), the master regulator of MB. We hypothesize that biogenic b2AR agonists stimulate MB and promote recovery of renal function by inducing a specific receptor conformation that leads to the production of cGMP. This hypothesis will be addressed through the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the effects of mitochondrial biogenic agonists-induced effects on the b2AR that lead to a biogenic conformation. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoblot analysis will identify b2AR phosphorylation sites required for the induction of MB. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of Gas- and Gai-dependent signaling pathways in the generation of cGMP and the induction of MB. Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA will identify the relevant signaling pathways for the induction of MB. Non-MB b2AR agonists will be used as controls. Aim 3 will determine the b2AR signaling pathways found in Aims 1 and 2 in the recovery of renal function following I/R injury using b2AR KO mice and pharmacological inhibitors. These results will further support the approach of using drugs that induce MB to accelerate recovery of renal function after AKI."
"9207209","ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish a Coordinating Center (CC) for the next phase of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) sponsored by the NIH. The objective of ATN is to increase awareness among at-risk youth of their HIV status and, for those with HIV, achieve linkage, engagement and retention in the care continuum. Many challenges are faced by adolescents during their transition to young adulthood, resulting from developmental changes, peer influences, identity, and self-esteem formation. Risky behaviors among adolescents, which include engaging in unprotected sexual encounters or sharing nonsterile injecting drug paraphernalia, increase their likelihood of acquiring HIV infection. In the 2013 US Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBSS), 34% of US high school students reported sexual intercourse during the prior 3 months, of which only 59% indicated condom use during last sexual intercourse. The YRBSS also found that only 13% of students had ever been tested for HIV infection. Given the global burden of new HIV infections among young people, greater involvement of adolescents in biomedical and behavioral HIV research is essential. However, significant individual, operational, and community-level barriers have been recognized to engaging adolescents in clinical prevention trials, which include insufficient understanding of research, need for parental consent, lack of access, mistrust and stigma associated with research participation. The new ATN is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating U19 investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for ATN projects. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies, comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include ATN information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to ATN by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the ATN. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for collaboration and extraordinary research productivity from protocol development through research data sharing."

"9137502","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and its complications are among the largest contributors to healthcare costs, cost growth, and patient morbidity and mortality. Diabetes is often not timely diagnosed. When it is diagnosed, patients often fail to comply with a complex treatment regimen. The health burden of diabetes falls disproportionately on the poor and on ethnic minorities.  A central goal of our project is to examine how the ACA expansion of Medicaid will affect diabetes diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes among the newly enrolled. We will do so using the natural experiment that results from some states expanding Medicaid and others choosing not to do so; combined with detailed, longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) for a large population of 9 million persons in four expansion and five non-expansion states.  The combination of a multi-state shock to Medicaid eligibility and large-scale access to EHR is unique. Prior studies of adult Medicaid expansions have been small-scale, short-duration, lacked detailed health records, or a combination of these limitations. The best available study, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, compared 6,000 new Medicaid recipients to 6,000 controls in a single state, for a two-year period. The Oregon research found large increases in diabetes diagnosis and use of diabetes medication, but no significant change in blood sugar levels. Yet any effect of Medicaid on outcomes will emerge slowly. In contrast, we estimate that we will have 100-150,000 new Medicaid recipients, 5 years of pre-treatment data to establish baseline health and match treated individuals to controls, 6 years of post-treatment data in the study period (with potential follow-up after that), and several treated state, with different Medicaid programs, and potential to expand to additional states. This will let us study both near- and medium term outcomes, and assess whether treatment effects vary with personal characteristics or the nature of the Medicaid program.  A second project goal is to innovate in causal inference methods. We will combine difference-in-differences (DiD), matching, and multiple imputation methods. We will use matching and multiple imputation methods to match control persons in non-expansion states, to match to new Medicaid enrollees in expansion states. We will use distributed lag regressions to map the emergence of any treatment effect over time. DiD, matching, and multiple imputation methods have not to our knowledge been combined in a single study. This combined design will be useful in studying other health insurance expansions."
"9223968","Abstract  Systematic reviews constitute the highest quality of evidence and form the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Such reviews now inform everything from national health policy guidelines to bedside care. However, systematic reviews are extremely laborious to produce; researchers can no longer keep pace with the massive amount of evidence now being published.  Semi-automation of systematic review production via machine learning (ML) has demonstrated the potential to substantially reduce reviewer workload while maintaining comprehensiveness. However, it is unlikely that machines will fully supplant human reviewers in the near future. Rather, human experts will probably remain in the loop, assisted by automated methods. Methods that exploit the intersection of human workers and ML models in the context of systematic reviews have not been explored at length. Furthermore, we believe there is substantial untapped potential in harnessing distributed crowd-workers to contribute to systematic reviews, and thus economize expert reviewer efforts. This novel avenue has largely been neglected as a means of increasing the efficiency of review production.  We propose addressing this gap by developing and evaluating novel, hybrid approaches to generating systematic reviews that jointly incorporate domain experts (systematic reviewers), layperson workers recruited via crowdworking platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk and volunteer citizen scientists, while simultaneously capitalizing on ML models.  This innovative, hybrid approach will be the first in-depth exploration of intelligent ML/human systems that aim to reduce the workload in the production of biomedical systematic reviews. Our strong preliminary work demonstrates the promise of this general strategy.  "
"9170234","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disease risk is governed by complex interactions between an individual's genetic background and environmental exposures, yet very little is currently understood about how environmental factors influence the genome. Recent studies suggest that dietary exposure, a key environmental factor with roles in the pathogenesis of obesity, type-2-diabetes (T2D), and other complex diseases, modulates gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. It is therefore likely that the epigenome, defined here as the overall epigenetic profile of an individual in a given cell type, represents a dynamic, reprogrammable interface through which dietary exposure shapes cellular function and disease susceptibility. Here we propose to comprehensively characterize the epigenome in individuals at high- and low-risk for developing T2D during the course of short- term overfeeding. Personalized epigenome profiles will be generated by mapping both chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and integrated with transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. This proposal represents the first personalized, integrative epigenome mapping study of its kind. We hypothesize that changes in diet will correlate with measurable, dynamic epigenetic signatures, which will provide important insight into the mechanisms underlying gene-environment interactions and yield clinically-relevant biomarkers for both exposure and disease."
"9295236","In this proposal, we address the enormous challenges common complex diseases pose for genomic analysis and the enormous opportunities surmounting them offers for advancing healthcare. The common genetic disorders proposed for study here are believed to have extreme locus heterogeneity, requiring the analysis of large numbers of samples to comprehensively identify the genomic variants underlying them. We propose that a combination of deep population studies and joint analysis of SNPs, indels, and structural variants both in coding and noncoding regions will provide the next level of understanding of common genetic disorders. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be critical to this next-generation approach to the genomics of complex disease. WGS will need to be accompanied by the technical ability to generate and handle very large data sets, a particular focus and strength of NYGC. WGS will also need to be accompanied by new statistical tools and algorithms, which will be developed by the strong core group committed to this proposal.  An overarching goal of this proposal, one that capitalizes on the power of WGS, is to identify disease- associated variants at the individual nucleotide level. In many cases pathogenic mutations fall in noncoding regions of the genome, which can only be fruitfully explored with WGS. A major effort will be put into building new computational strategies to functionally annotate noncoding transcribed sequences, and to build new datasets to enable such strategies, opening new frontiers of understanding of disease-related regulatory variants. We will explore a wide spectrum of human variation using the WGS platform, including rare variants of modest to large effect, de novo variants of large effect, and common variants of small effect. We will combine available RNA and epigenomic datasets to predict modes of action of risk and identify protective alleles. These results, combined with the integration of environmental and clinical data, will enhance our understanding of genetic risk for common disease and lay the groundwork for utilization of personal genomics in disease prevention and treatment, including the delineation of pathways for drug development.  Many of the population cohorts proposed for study are from New York, which harbors the most diverse population in the world. Analyzing diverse populations is a critical component of comprehensive common disease analysis, as effect sizes of individual alleles are believed to vary in different populations due to gene- gene interactions. Using the genetic admixture present in different populations from NY and throughout the United States, we will conduct the first systematic study of these interaction effects in many phenotypes.  These aims will be accomplished through widespread collaborations, with genomicists, physicians, and patients, organized through a focused team at NYGC. They will be enriched by the collaboration and support from independent Foundations."
"9203659","PROJECT SUMMARY Introduction of combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) in the mid 90th has significantly decreased the rate of mortality and enhanced the quality of life of HIV-infected individuals. However as the HIV+ population ages, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and neurologic complications are increased, which reflects the complex pathophysiological interactions in this population. Identification of early biomarkers that could identify subjects at higher risks for these complications would help better manage aging HIV-infected patients. We have recently identified the over-expression of proinflammatory isoforms of the novel cytokine IL-32 as a robust biomarker that can predict control failure in HIV-infected subjects with a history of slow disease progression. IL-32 is an inflammatory cytokine that induces multiple other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1? and TNF?; all of which are involved in CVD. IL-32 over-expression in vascular tissues is directly associated with CVD. The mechanism(s) behind the over-expression of IL-32 in HIV infection, particularly in treated subjects, remain elusive. IL-32 is part of the innate immune response to viral and bacterial infections and therefore, heightened expression is likely mediated by residual HIV replication under cART but also by other microbial agents that might egress from a dysbiosed gut, weakened in the event of Th17 cell depletion. In this proposal, we aim to demonstrate that over-expression of the proinflammatory isoforms of IL-32 results in cardiac complications that increase with aging. As we showed that IL-32 could robustly predict disease progression in HIV infection several years in advance, we expect to establish the same predictability for cardiac complications. In Specific aim 1, we will take advantage of two large cohorts (The Canadian Cohort of HIV and Aging (CCHA) directed by Dr Cecile Tremblay and the WIHS cohort, directed by our co-applicant Dr Robert Kaplan) to generate a map of expression for the different isoforms of IL-32 in young versus old HIV-infected men and women. We will correlate these measures with a panel of well-established inflammatory biomarkers and subclinical clinical CVD markers such as calcium score, IMT as well as with CVD clinical outcomes. In Specific Aim 2, we will study the interplay between IL-32 expression and HIV reservoirs and residual viremia by comparing young and old groups of HIV infected individuals from the same cohorts. We also aim to study the ability of HIV residual replication to up-regulate IL-32 pro-inflammatory isoforms expression and to down-regulate the less inflammatory ones. In Specific aim 3, we will investigate the impact of intestinal dysbiosis on the induction of IL-32 proinflammatory isoforms by intestinal epithelium. We will also determine the impact of IL-32 production on Th17/Treg ratio at the mucosal and systemic levels in correlation with HIV-related CVD. Together, the overarching goal of this project is to demonstrate that IL-32 is a central player in systemic inflammation and a mediator of CVD and that this cytokine can be used as a predictive biomarker for disease but also as a therapeutic target to modulate inflammatory processes and tackle HIV reservoirs."
"9168204","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposal is to phenotype early- to mid-gestational mouse embryos by segmenting select organ systems in 3D data sets acquired in utero with high-frequency ultrasound (HFU). The International Mouse Phe- notyping Consortium (IMPC), which includes the NIH Knockout (KO) Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), will generate 20,000 mouse strains in the next decade, including many important models of human structural birth defects and congenital diseases. The development of phenotyping methods that provide for ef?cient pipeline analyses of defects in embryonic growth in the KO mouse strains is a high priority for this effort. An in utero 3D imaging approach, enabling volumetric and longitudinal analyses of a variety of organ systems over a range of early- to mid-gestational stage mouse embryos, would provide added bene?t and critical additional in vivo data not currently available. Commercial HFU systems are widely available in many research centers largely thanks to the NIH-funded Small Animal Imaging Research Programs and Shared Instrumentation Programs. HFU is therefore an excellent candidate modality to provide in utero 3D image data that can be quantitatively analyzed and archived to support the KOMP2/IMPC embryonic lethal phenotyping pipeline and future phenotyping efforts. We propose to develop and validate in utero 3D HFU image-acquisition protocols and image-processing meth- ods that permit noninvasive, longitudinal studies of embryonic development and, in particular, the detection and characterization of KO phenotypes. Volumetric HFU data will be collected in utero from mouse embryos staged between E9.5 to 15.5 in order to establish a database of normal development. Algorithms will be developed to segment 3D regions and extract parameters that quantify embryonic stage and identify regional changes between normal and KO embryos. We will acquire data with a custom, annular-array system and with a VisualSonics Vevo 2100. The ?ne-resolution annular-array data will be used to initially develop the image-processing algorithms and then the algorithms will be adapted for Vevo 2100 data. We will compare the quantitative parameters derived from the segmentation results obtained from the two scanners to ensure that the Vevo 2100 is able to provide equivalent mutant detection and quanti?cation. Initial testing will be undertaken using wild-type and En1 and Gli2 mutants that have known defects. Finally, the acquisition and processing protocols will be applied to 3D Vevo 2100 data from 5-10 KOMP2 KO mouse lines with embryonic defects in a variety of organ systems to validate the HFU methods for detecting and characterizing phenotypes in these mutant embryos."
"9135964","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute respiratory infections (ARI) including influenza-like illness (ILI) can result in significant morbidity and mortality, direct medical expenses including outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and indirect costs due to lost work and school days. New population-based studies assessing the incidence and etiologies of ARI/ILI need to be conducted as ARI/ILI incidence and transmission as well as factors associated with ARI/ILI epidemiology have changed since previous population-based studies were conducted decades ago. Likewise, modern diagnostic techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) expands the potential for greater knowledge regarding the epidemiology and etiology of viral ARI/ILIs; in previous historical studies in an estimated 75% of ARI/ILI-associate samples no virus was identified. Specific Aims: 1) Identify incidence of ARI and ILI in a representative population-based community sample; (2) Identify the etiology of these ARIs and ILIs; and (3) Assess individual and household factors associated with incidence and transmission of ARI/ILI. Secondary aims: (1) Assess differences in prevalence and etiology of ARI/ILI between this study's community population and those seeking acute care; and (2) Determine effectiveness of influenza vaccination on prevention of influenza illness in the study's community sample. Methods: Three hundred households will be followed for at least a year, maintaining a surveillance population of approximately 1000 individuals per year. Households will be identified by randomly sampling an existing cohort of households currently enrolled in a community-based survey study already recruited via a random, stratified sampling of households in the Washington Heights/Inwood area of Northern Manhattan. ARI/ILI surveillance will be conducted twice-weekly using text messaging with phone follow-up. Nasopharyngeal swabs will be obtained from ill household members and analyzed to identify ARI/ILI associated viruses via multiplex RT-PCR. Individual and household factors associated with ARI/ILI incidence and transmission will be assessed using general estimating equation regression models. Comparing this study's data with hospital data will assess differences in prevalence/etiology of ARI/ILI between community populations and those seeking acute care. Laboratory data will be combined with our pediatric/ adult immunization registry to determine seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed influenza using a case-control analysis. Outcomes: The primary outcomes will be (1) incidence and prevalence of ARI/ILI; (2) etiologies of ARI/ILI; (3) factors associated with ARI/ILI incidence and transmission. Secondary outcomes will include (1) differences in the prevalence and etiology of ARI/ILI between community population and those seeking acute care; (2) influenza vaccine effectiveness in prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza.  If successful this project could provide important new information to help plan ARI/ILI interventions including new vaccines, vaccination strategies, and surveillance for viral pathogens, including future outbreaks."
"9254379","ABSTRACT The EEG PatchTM is a single channel, (2 electrode) wearable, patch-like device designed for long-term, EEG recording in people with epilepsy to be used in their everyday environment. To maximize the treatment of epilepsy, it is critical to capture important day-to-day changes in EEG activity for long periods including the occurrence and duration of epileptiform events such as spike-wave discharges and seizures. Having access to a more complete record of a person?s seizures may improve the treatment strategy to balance the side-effects of anti-seizure medication with seizure control. Due to a lack of long-term EEG data, clinicians are forced to rely on seizure diaries, a method of self-reporting seizures that has been shown to be inaccurate and often misleading, simply because the person does not realize they have had a seizure.

"9338997","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups. A multitude of genetic studies in AD have identified multiple AD associated genes and loci, but a large portion of the genetic influence on AD remain unknown. The Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) will use large-scale sequencing efforts to increase our knowledge about the genetic variation that influences AD, particularly rare genetic variants that enhance AD risk or protect against AD. Substantially underrepresented in these efforts, however, is the generalization of current and future findings in African Americans (AA).  AA have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Despite steady improvement in the overall health of the U.S. population, individuals within these underserved groups continue to be vulnerable to lapses in care and are at increased risk for health problems. Health disparities have had an especially profound negative effect on the overall health of AA. AA have disproportionally higher health-risk factors, limited access to health services, and ultimately poorer health outcomes and life expectancies than NHW. The determinants of the health disparities seen in AA are many, including public health policy, clinical practices, and social, economic, cultural and/or language factors. One promising avenue for reducing health disparities is the use of precision medicine to improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. However, genomic medicine relies on participation from diverse populations in both research and clinical applications.  Through this application, we will address this important issue by conducting genomic studies of AD in AA. In response to RFA AG-16-002, we are proposing a set of experiments that will complement and extend the activities and results of the ADSP Discovery and Replication phases, thereby addressing the issue of health disparities in AD research. Specifically we propose a family-based study in AA that parallels the family-based efforts in the ADSP Discovery phase and that will enhance and extend current ADSP efforts to a broader AD community. Specifically, we will 1) Expand our existing AA family dataset; 2.) Generalize and refine ADSP risk and protective loci in familial AA AD. 3.) Prioritize variants by admixture mapping and bioinformatics analysis and 4.) Perform multi-locus analyses providing insight into functional implications of the known risk and protective loci and identifying possible additional genic targets. Our overall goal is to identify targets for therapeutic development that will either  prevent or significantly delay the onset of AD."

Vivreon Biosciences is an innovative life sciences company that is developing a series of novel small molecule, Ca2+ channel inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Our lead compound series achieves neuroprotection by an entirely new mechanism ? inhibition of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels to block microgliosis. Vivreon seeks NIA funding to bridge the gap between discovery and development. We will optimize our promising lead compound series through medicinal chemistry. Upon successful completion of the program, our preclinical candidate will be the first to specifically target the CRAC pathway for neuroprotection in AD, thus comprising an entirely new tool in the battle against AD. Vivreon has discovered a lead compound series with oral bioavailability that penetrates into the central nervous system (CNS) very efficiently, shows no neurotoxicity in the Irwin test of CNS integrity, and demonstrates neuroprotection in a mouse model of microgliosis (experimental autoimmune encephalitis). The lead series inhibits microgliosis by blocking CRAC channel activity with nM potency; suppressing M1 NF-?B activity, while preserving M2 phagocytosis. We will improve on these favorable properties through medicinal chemistry lead optimization followed by biological screening. Our lead presents several routes for modification that could lead to improved drug-like properties, and these routes will be pursued to identify a preclinical candidate molecule suitable for future Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies. The candidate will be identified using an animal model suitable for AD (5XFAD, Dr. Blurton- Jones, University of California, Irvine). The final aim for this proposal is synthesis and characterization of the first CRAC channel inhibitor for AD therapy."
"9174860","Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) refers to brain injury resulting from reduced blood and oxygen flow to a baby's brain near the time of birth. HIE affects up to 12,000 newborns each year in the U.S. Half of affected infants have a bad outcome including death, cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment despite receiving hypothermia, the only available treatment. Cerebral palsy is the most common long term neurodevelopmental impairment in survivors of HIE. Each year in the U.S., new cases of HIE resulting in cerebral palsy impose an estimated economic burden of $1.7 billion in lifetime costs. Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine with remarkable neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects demonstrated in animal models of neonatal brain injury. Epo reduces apoptotic, inflammatory and oxidative brain injury following hypoxia- ischemia, and enhances neurogenesis and oligodendrocyte survival, promoting brain regeneration and improved function. In non-human primates, Epo reduces the rate of cerebral palsy and improves neurologic function in animals undergoing hypothermia for HIE. Small human trials suggest that infants with HIE treated with Epo have better neurologic outcomes. In our phase I trial of Epo + hypothermia, we found that Epo 1000 U/Kg/dose best reproduced the pharmacokinetics of neuroprotective dosing in animal models. Long term outcomes were better than expected based on entry criteria and MRI findings. Our phase II trial compared 50 cooled infants randomized to receive Epo or placebo. Infants treated with hypothermia + Epo had less brain injury on early MRI, and better 6-month developmental outcome based on a standardized parental questionnaire. Epo is commercially available, relatively inexpensive, and safe in neonates. We hypothesize that Epo given to cooled infants with moderate/severe HIE will reduce the combined primary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment from 49 to 33%. To test this hypothesis, we propose a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial of Epo therapy in 500 infants with HIE undergoing hypothermia. Our specific aims are 1) To determine if 5 doses of Epo 1000 U/kg IV reduces the rate of death, motor or cognitive deficits at 2 years; 2) To assess safety of Epo by evaluating clinical toxicity; and 3) To determine whether Epo decreases the severity of neonatal brain injury as evidenced by early MRI and circulating biomarkers of brain injury. Motor outcome will be determined by a standardized neurologic exam and by the Gross Motor Function Classification System. Cognitive outcome will be determined by Bayley III exam. In secondary analyses, we will examine the effect of Epo on cerebral palsy, severity of motor impairment, Bayley III cognitive and language scores, epilepsy and behavioral abnormalities. We anticipate that Epo will confer improved 2-year neurodevelopmental outcome, will be safe, and will decrease brain injury severity as determined by early biomarkers. The CCC will initiate and monitor sites, coordinate patient enrollment and follow-up, collect clinical and safety data, and maintain IRB and regulatory compliance.

"9197817","PROJECT ABSTRACT The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9146277","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is hypothesized that the degree to which the G protein, Gs?, is associated with lipid rafts is an indicator of both depression and therapeutic response. The original observations suggesting this biosignature were made in postmortem tissue, and we have extended this work with in vivo and in vitro preliminary data suggesting that raft localization of Gs?, determined by simple detergent extraction, is a biomarker of both depression and antidepressant response. There are suggestions that n-3 PUFA either have antidepressant activity or can synergize the action of some antidepressant drugs. To test this, we will use a glial cell line as well as lymphoblasts from depressed subjects who were either antidepressant responsive or unresponsive. This should provide a predictive model for the response to an antidepressant agent, whether that agent is fish oil, citalopram, or some combination. We will test the applicability of the biomarker by measuring the lipid raft distributin of Gs? in membranes from blood cells collected during an NIMH-funded clinical trial showing n-3 PUFA augmentation of antidepressant response. The proposed experiments also attempt to mesh mechanistic preclinical studies with a clinical study to propose and test a biomarker. The preclinical work seeks to determine whether in-vitro treatment with antidepressants ± n-3 PUFA shifts Gs? into non-raft fractions of the plasma membrane, where it more effectively activates adenylyl cyclase. We suggest that a compound with antidepressant efficacy concentrates in cholesterol-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts) and disrupts the anchoring of Gs? within those domains. One possible mechanism for this is direct modification of Gs?. This will be studied by biochemical fractionation of membrane components, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and by cellular imaging. Since most antidepressant therapy (save ketamine) requires a time lag prior to therapeutic efficacy and this can be replicated in cells, translocation of Gs? in response to antidepressant agents will be monitored in real time using a fluorescent Gs? fusion protein. Should n-3 PUFA show these biological hallmarks of antidepressant activity, alone or in combination with SSRIs , this will be translated by examining blood taken in a clinical study of the antidepressant efficacy of n-3 PUFA (± SSRIs). Initial data from this study show a greater antidepressant response to n3 PUFA + SSRI than to placebo or SSRI alone. Finally, we will test, with the biochemical and imaging studies, lymphoblasts, derived from depressed patients with known response (or lack thereof) to citalopram. One goal is to develop a high content screen that might suggest, prospectively, the effectiveness of a given potential therapy. Successful completion of the proposed studies will also indicate the usefulness of n-3 PUFA supplementation to antidepressant therapy for decreasing time of therapeutic onset and/or lowering overall antidepressant dose. They will also pave the way toward establishing a low-cost blood biomarker for both depression and antidepressant efficacy over a broad range of agents."
"9056355","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aqueous-deficient dry eye is among the most common and debilitating clinical manifestations of systemic autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren's syndrome. It is well established that chronic inflammation represents the predominant driving force in dry eye disease, however, the causal mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression are unclear. As such, there is no cure for dry eye and few treatment options are available for sufferers. A long overlooked component of aqueous-deficient dry eye in autoimmune diseases like SS, is disruption of the complex reflex network of corneal nerves that connect the sensory tissues with the secretory glands. The integrity of this neural network is essential for maintaining a healthy ocular surface and there is growing evidence that innervation itself is a negative modulator of inflammation. In this application we will use a mouse model of Sjögren's syndrome to define the cellular processes that lead to denervation of the cornea and lacrimal gland in dry eye, as well as identify mechanisms to restore innervation and reverse ocular surface damage in Sjögren's syndrome patients. We hypothesize that chronic, T cell-mediated inflammation alters innervation by inhibiting epithelial maintenance of nerves in the cornea and lacrimal gland, resulting in loss of tissue integrity and reduced tear secretion that perpetuate ocular surface disease and aqueous tear deficiency. To test this hypothesis we will: 1) Define the timing of denervation and corresponding pathological changes in the cornea, lacrimal gland and associated nerves during dry eye development; and 2) Determine the mechanisms by which T cell-mediated inflammation alters innervation of the cornea and lacrimal glands. To achieve these aims we will employ a combination of in vivo and ex vivo studies, as well as transcriptional profiling, in a well-characterized mouse model of Sjögren's syndrome. Outcomes here will define modulators of ocular organ innervation, identify potential biomarkers of disease progression, and reveal novel regenerative strategies for reversing dry eye disease."

"9304662","PROJECT SUMMARY To date, the lack of focus on children in the health care quality movement has been notable. Quality gaps in many areas of pediatric health care delivery have been identified; however, for almost all such conditions, appropriate pediatric quality measures have not been available. In response to the call for proposals for the Cooperative Research Demonstration and Dissemination Projects, we present the Q-METRIC Implementation and Quality Improvement project to test and implement 6 measures in 3 distinct measure sets. Each set is focused on a significant issue in the care of children: sickle cell disease, overuse of imaging for headaches and seizures, and outpatient care of asthma. Collectively, these measures offer great potential for improving pediatric health care quality. All were developed and tested by the Q-METRIC team during the initial Pediatric Quality Measure Program (PQMP) grant period, using a rigorous and validated process. Nearly all of these measures have been submitted and approved for inclusion in the National Quality Measure Clearinghouse (NQMC), and one measure has been endorsed by the National Quality Forum and recommended for inclusion in the Medicaid Core Measure Set. Importantly, the selected measures are all claims-based and do not require costly and time-intensive chart review; this makes them easier to implement and use. The Q-METRIC Implementation and Quality Improvement team consists of investigators from the Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit at the University of Michigan, 2 State Medicaid programs, 3 health plans, 3 health systems, 1 clinical consortium, and several national leaders in measurement and improvement, who populate our expert advisory committees. The partnerships developed for this project will bring remarkable innovation to the dissemination and implementation of the quality measures through (1) our capacity to create synergy across a wide range of methodologic, analytic, and measurement testing scenarios, and (2) the opportunity to develop multiple quality improvement (QI) interventions for implementation across state, health plan, and health system levels. This approach will focus on the key goals of assessing the feasibility and useability of these newly developed measures at the three identified levels. Project efforts will be organized around the development of two teams. Each team will address specific components of the two key goals stated in the FOA: Team A: field testing, refinement, data collection, and reporting on the new measures, and Team B: use of performance data from the measures to define QI goals and test multilevel improvement strategies. These 2 teams will be organized to work both in parallel and in tandem to accomplish project goals. We will focus on the following objectives: 1) continued appraisal of regular performance scores and reliability assessments of these measures, at the state level; 2) field testing to ensure scientific acceptability at the health plan and health system level, followed by appraisal of regular performance scores at these levels; and 3) exploration of the feasibility of specification as e-measures."
"9099093","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding how exogenous hydrocarbons can interfere with key signaling pathways critical for pleiotropic drug response (PDR) and other critical biochemical pathways important for cellular signal ling. Persistence of this gap in knowledge represent an important problem because some people were exposed to 4-methylcyclohexane methanol (MCHM) and had immediate unexplained health problems. Long-term health problems are challenging to predict without obtaining this information. The long- term goal is to identify proteins that mediate phenotypic variation in response to toxic chemicals so that predictors of genotypes of individuals, both yeast and humans, with increased sensitivity to environmental stressors can be established. The objective in this application is to determine cellular pathways that are affected by MCHM. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, exposure to MCHM activated the pleiotropic drug response and down-regulated biosynthetic pathways responsible for making second messengers. The central hypothesis is that sub-lethal MCHM exposure will alter cellular pathways including the inositol and PDR pathways. This hypothesis was formulated based on preliminary data showing that S. cerevisiae exposed to MCHM significantly lagged in growth in comparison to unexposed cells. The rationale for this proposal is that a determination of the cellular effects of MCHM will provide a mechanism-based framework for subsequent detailed studies on MCHM's health effects in humans and further experiments with Xenopus tropicalis. The following specific aims are proposed: 1. Determine cellular pathways affected by MCHM and required for degradation of MCHM and 2. Assess the impact of variation in Med15 on MCHM response. Under the first aim we will monitor changes in cellular viability and transcriptional memory across yeast with different responses to MCHM. Under the second specific aim the focus will be on how genetic variation within Med15, an important and polymorphic transcriptional regulator changes the transcriptional and phenotypic response to MCHM measured by RNA-seq and proteomics respectively. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by assessing cellular responses using a systems approach including genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic in genetically diverse yeast strains. This contribution will be significant because it will directly provide the foundation for determination of long-term effects f MCHM exposure on basic cellular function in a model organisms. In turn, this is likely to contribute to an understanding of potential human health long-term effects due to MCHM and other structurally similar but also understudied chemicals."
"9160664","Joel Kralj: Project Summary Electrical transients are a fundamental currency of communication between, and within, all living cells. Dysregulated electrical handling is a hallmark of many diseases including neurological and cardiac diseases. Patch clamp, the gold standard technique for measuring and controlling cellular voltage, has been utilized by neuroscientists and cardiologists with many fantastic successes. Despite the power of the technique, patch clamp is limited by the nature of its technically challenging, slow, and serial experiments.  Optical voltage sensing overcomes many limitations of patch clamp. Measurements can be obtained from hundreds of cells in parallel, enabling rapid electrophysiological tests across many conditions including chemical and genetic perturbations. Microbial rhodopsins were shown to be highly sensitive and fast genetically encoded, fluorescent voltage indicators. Combinations of these probes with channelrhodopsin yielded ?optopatch?, a platform for all-optical voltage actuation and sensing, permitting rapid automated single cell electrophysiology.  The goal of this proposal is to generate an all-optical platform capable of measuring the contribution of every gene in the human genome to neuronal electrophysiology. This data will be the founding of electromics, the tie between electrophysiology and genetics. The platform will combine lenti-viral knockdown microarray chips, an automated optopatch microscope, human ES-derived neurons, and data processing will enable measurements at the necessary scale. Complete knockdown and expression libraries will be recorded. Electrophysiological perturbations arising from a model of ALS will also be tested on the platform to both (i) understand disease etiology, and (ii) search for protein knockdown targets to ameliorate symptoms.  The proposed platform will vastly exceed the throughput of traditional measurements, and will generate revolutionary data for neuroscience. Combined with the burgeoning field of iPS derived disease models, our platform will allow us to investigate electromics in a variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. However, other cell types will be accessible including cardiomyocytes (heart disease), T-cells (auto-immunity), and beta cells (diabetes). The ubiquity of voltage in biology multiplies the value of the instrument. Further studies will extend to any temporally encoded cellular signal including Ca++, transcription factor dynamics, or ATP. Ultimately, I envision a community-wide resource where investigators with interesting cellular models could utilize our platform to discover genetic influences on dynamic signaling."

"9228681","Project Abstract Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed. These beta cells are specifically targeted for destruction by autoreactive T cells, which manage to escape the normal elimination mechanisms in the thymus. Although it is clear that besides environmental factors a strong genetic component is involved, the underlying basis for autoimmune T1D is not well understood. GWAS for a number of diseases, including T1D, have recently highlighted regulatory DNA regions rather than protein coding sequences as hot spots where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as causal variants can be found. Our long term goal is to decipher the molecular mechanism of genotype-phenotype causalities in T1D. Our overall objective is the in depth characterization of DNA regulatory elements and their risk variants that underlie T1D susceptibility on a molecular and functional level. Our central hypothesis is that T1D associated SNPs alter the function of cell type-specific DNA regulatory elements. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will approach this hypothesis from 3 complementary angles: We will use state-of-the-art and novel computational strategies to fine map T1D GWAS SNPs to candidate causal variants (Aim 1). We will characterize the mechanism of action of causal candidates SNPs by utilizing a combination of functional genomics and proteomics (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine the functional relevance of causal variants in T1D-relevant human(-ized) systems (Aim 3). This approach is highly innovative and will provide the first in depth functional characterization of DNA regulatory elements and their risk variants that underlie T1D susceptibility. Our studies will provide a significant shift from the correlative to the functional investigation of human T1D susceptibility. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to translate to novel approaches to predict, prevent and potentially to treat T1D."

Improving the outcomes of people in treatment would benefit the clients, their family and friends, and, indirectly, the larger society. While addiction treatment does reduce subsequent healthcare costs, more effective interventions hold the promise of even more savings in healthcare costs, especially if they reduce the probability of relapse and the costs of and need for subsequent treatments.  This SBIR project will add another product to our set of programs for people with alcohol and drug problems. A long-term goal of Checkup & Choices LLC is to develop and offer evidence- based interventions both to the general public and to treatment providers (both in substance abuse treatment and in primary healthcare). We have already developed the Drinker?s Check-up, a brief motivational intervention for heavy drinkers, the College Drinker?s Check-up for younger adults, ModerateDrinking.com for less dependent problem drinkers, and Right Turns, a web application for DWI offenders. This application follows logically in sequence: a program to help people abstain once they?re motivated to do so."
"9138620","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron is an essential functional component of heme and hemoglobin and is required for red blood cell synthesis. During increased red cell production, intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron from stores are increased, facilitating the production of new erythrocytes. The liver produced hormone hepcidin controls the major flows of iron into plasma: absorption of dietary iron in intestine, recycling of iron by macrophages, which ingest old erythrocytes and other cells, and mobilization of stored iron from hepatocytes. Following erythropoietic stimulation, hepcidin rapidly decreases causing more iron to be delivered for red blood cell synthesis, but the mechanism was unknown until recently. We identified the erythroid hormone erythroferrone (ERFE), an orphan member of the C1q-TNF family of proteins, and presented evidence that it regulates hepcidin during intensified red blood cell production. ERFE is a potent (EC50~100 pM) suppressor of hepcidin, is produced by erythroid precursors in response to erythropoietin (EPO) and is required for rapid suppression of hepcidin after hemorrhage or EPO administration. The targets of ERFE are the hepcidin-secreting hepatocytes. The molecular mechanism by which ERFE suppresses hepatic hepcidin expression is unknown and is the subject of this proposal. The specific aims of the proposed project are: Aim 1) To characterize the structure-function relationship of ERFE. We will generate and test truncated forms of ERFE and collagen domain ERFE mutants to determine the structural features that are important for ERFE function in vivo and in vitro. We will also determine ERFE's oligomerization state in circulation by blue native PAGE. We expect the TNF-like domain of ERFE to be important for its activity and the hepcidin-suppressive form of circulating ERFE to be a trimer. Aim 2) To identify the ERFE receptor. We will use progressively more general strategies starting from a candidate receptor screen to unbiased proteomic analysis of ligand-receptor complexes. Based on ERFE similarity to C1q-TNF family of ligands whose known receptors are either progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) or members of the TNF receptor family, we will first complete our so far negative PAQR screen. We will then use an ELISA-like assay to screen a TNF receptor family library using ERFE as the test ligand. If these approaches do not yield verified receptors, we will proceed to screening expression libraries with ERFE and to proteomic analysis of ERFE complexed with its biological receptor in a hepatocyte cell line. Aim 3) To determine the signaling pathway by which ERFE suppresses hepcidin. We will use phosphopeptide mass spectrometry and promoter mutational analysis to link the putative signaling pathway with its associated transcription factors that bind to the hepcidin promoter. We expect ERFE to signal through pathways similar to those of other TNF family members, such as the MEK/ERK pathway. Targeting the hepcidin-suppressing erythroid hormone pathway may offer improved treatments for patients with hepcidin- related iron disorders."
"9145196","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with considerable morbidity, mortality, and costs. Infection rates with antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria continue to increase. As was recently outlined in President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report on antibiotic resistance, novel interventions are needed to curb the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Through an AHRQ contract, we performed a 20 ICU cluster randomized trial (BUGG study) to determine if wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact reduced VRE and MRSA acquisition compared to the usual standard of care; the results were published in JAMA. The study showed a 40% decrease in MRSA acquisition but no effect on VRE acquisition. The differing results for MRSA and VRE led many intensivists, infectious disease physicians, hospital epidemiologists, and hospital administrators to be uncertain about whether to implement the intervention of universal glove and gown in their ICU. The original peri-anal cultures from the BUGG study were stored so that they could be analyzed in the future for other bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Gram- negative bacteria. What is not known that this application will address is whether wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact in the ICU leads to a decrease in antibiotic-resistant Gram- negative bacteria. The overall objective of this application is to determine whether wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact leads to a decrease in the acquisition of carbapenem- resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Our central hypothesis is that the intervention will be effective at decreasing the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The rationale for this application is that the BUGG study left an important question unanswered: What is the effect of universal glove and gown on carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria? The aim of this study is to use already collected peri-anal specimens to assess whether wearing gloves and gowns decreases the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The significance of the proposed research is that it will determine whether wearing gloves and gowns for all patient contact in the ICU setting will lead to a decrease in the acquisition of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This application, if funded, has an exceedingly high probability of success because the proposed secondary analysis is based on an already completed randomized cluster trial. All of the specimens have been obtained and can be worked up in a very cost-effective manner. This allows AHRQ to answer an important question without funding from scratch a new randomized cluster trial."
"9272128","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIH Common Fund recognizes a pressing need to better quantify clinically important symptoms and outcomes, including pain, fatigue, and quality of life. The NIH Common Fund has led to an unprecedented number of large-scale initiatives to develop patient reported outcomes (PROs) for health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for use in: 1) the general population (funded by NIH); 2) adult epilepsy, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease (funded by NINDS); 3) spinal cord injury (funded by NCMRR and NINDS); and 4) traumatic brain injury (funded by NIDRR and the VA RR&D). More recently, the NINDS has extended these measurement development efforts to include Huntington disease (HD)-a fatal, insidious, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormalities in motor, cognitive, and psychiatric functions. HD is one of the more devastating neurological diseases, as symptoms gradually appear and worsen until eventually causing death. The effort to develop an HD-specific measure, called the HD- QOL, replicated state-of-the art qualitative methodology (utilized in the aforementioned PROs projects) to identify relevant HRQOL domains/themes in HD and develop items that reflect these domains/themes. Focus groups consisting of individuals with or at-risk for HD, family members and caregivers, and HD professionals were conducted to identify issues of HRQOL that were relevant for individuals with HD. Findings indicated the diverse issues (emotional, physical, social, cognitive and end of life) that confront individuals with HD. Specifically, findings demonstrated that while many of the constructs measured by the new PROs are relevant and important in this population, there is also a need for assessment of HD-specific HRQOL issues that are not already captured by these existing measurement systems (i.e., end of life issues, chorea, and speech and swallowing difficulties). As a result, items reflecting these HD-specific constructs were developed to complement the preexisting PRO initiatives. The proposed project will validate the HD-QOL and other relevant, newly developed PROs in a diverse sample of individuals with HD. Specifically, a state-of-the-art approach employing both classical and contemporary methods of test construction and validation - including Item Response Theory and computerized adaptive testing technology - will be used to develop a computerized adaptive test that permits brief and precise measurement of clinically relevant symptoms and functional limitations. In addition, this study will examine these measures' sensitivity and responsiveness to change over time. This new HD-QOL measurement system will allow clinicians to monitor patients by detecting small but important changes in HD HRQOL outcomes, allow researchers to conduct more efficient HD clinical trials (highly sensitive measures require fewer study participants), and allow patients to more effectively communicate their HRQOL concerns to their providers."

Data that emerge from in vitro screens will be prioritized for in  vivo efficacy studies at the Center for Co-Clinical Trials. Here, a dedicated pharmacology staff will evaluate  single agents or drug combinations in the most relevant pre-clinical PDAC models, including human PDx and  autochthonous GEM models. Through comprehensive pharmacologic analyses, the Core B aims to evaluate  novel therapeutic approaches and define biomarkers that may predict responsiveness in clinical trials."
"9072836","PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY  It has long been appreciated that chronic inflammation poses a potential risk for the development of cancer.  However, it is still an evolving research area for how inflammation and tissue repair are intrinsically linked to  cancer. IL-17A (IL-17), a signature cytokine produced by a subset of T helper cells termed Th17 cells, plays  essential roles in host defense and contributes to autoimmune inflammatory diseases. High IL-17A levels in  hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)  are indicative of poorer prognosis. While IL-17 is emerging as an important cytokine in cancer promotion and  progression, the underlining molecular mechanism remains unclear. We now discovered a novel IL-17-induced  Act1/TRAF4-mediated ERK5 cascade that directly stimulates epidermal stem cell expansion, epidermal  hyperplasia and tumor formation. While Act1 (the adaptor for the IL-17 receptor) interacts with TRAF6 and  TRAF2/5, to activate NF-?B and mediate posttranscriptional control of inflammatory genes (including IL-6),  respectively; TRAF4 binds Act1 to promote ERK5 activation. While Act1, TRAF4 or ERK5 deficiency resulted  in a loss of IL-17-induced epidermal hyperplasia, epidermal-specific deletion of Act1 or TRAF4 deficiency was  sufficient to protect mice from DMBA/TPA-induced carcinogenesis. Mechanistically, Act1/TRAF4-dependent  ERK5 activation was achieved through the interaction of IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) with EGFR, resulting in  MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 activation. While IL-17A stimulation induced EGFR phosphorylation, epidermal EGFR-  deficiency specifically blocked IL-17A-induced ERK5 activation, epidermal proliferation and tumor formation.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that EGFR is recruited to IL-17R to mediate ERK5 activation in tumor  initiating cells, contributing to epidermal proliferation and skin tumorigenesis. The direct impact of IL-17  signaling on tumor cells is synergized by pro-inflammatory action of IL-17 (e.g. IL-6 production) in stromal cells.  To test this hypothesis, we will (1) Investigate the molecular mechanism by which IL-17R interacts with EGFR  to mediate the activation of ERK5; (2) Investigate the target genes of the IL-17A-induced TRAF4-ERK5 axis  that promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis; (3) Study the cellular mechanism by which the IL-17R-EGFR-  ERK5 pathway contributes to chemical- and wound-induce tumorigenesis. The completion of this study will  provide mechanistic insight into IL-17-dependent tumorigenesis, which will lead to new therapeutic strategies  for cancer treatments."
"9344783","Developing sensitive and valid indicators of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), dementia and cognitive function in low literacy and low income countries is challenging and requires creative approaches to complement standard neuropsychological batteries. In this proposal, we aim to incorporate an innovative approach to assessing cognition and to validate it against standard cognitive batteries, medical and informant assessments, brain function assessed from MRI's and genetic analyses of APOE in 3 HRS sister countries: South Africa (HAALSI), United States (HRS/COG), and Ireland (TILDA). South Africa has a low literacy rate in older people, varying degrees of use of written language and different cultural cues compared to Western industrialized countries. In order to assess cognition in this setting, we assess cognitive function leveraging non-verbal and minimally numeric assessments for a range of cognitive domains. Through administration via tablets, responses are recorded and scored immediately. The tablet- based assessments will be validated in relation to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) developed by HRS across HAALSI, TILDA and HRS/COG (Aim 1). Additional information from MRI's and genetic analyses increase validity. Clinical and informant interviews are added to develop an AD and dementia risk score (Aim 2). We conduct the validations and harmonization in age and education stratified samples of 300 men and women 50 -79 years old in each of the three cohorts (n=900).  Novel `next generation' instruments are being developed and we now need information regarding their validity compared to standard cognitive assessments. Additional psychometric evaluation in collaboration with PITCH (R01AG051170, Jones PI) will aid in refining these measures. Developing cross-walks between these measures and other commonly used indices is of special importance in the set of sister studies related to the Health and Retirement Study where the explicit goals are to permit comparisons across countries, especially with regard to AD and dementia. TILDA and HAALSI offer specific advantages in calibration because they have had rich additional neuropsychological and health data from earlier waves across an educationally diverse older population. We have two aims in our proposal: Aim 1. To assess the validity of the Oxford based language controlled cognitive measures in relation to the HCAP measures using identical platforms for HRS/COG, TILDA and HAALSI 1.a. to evaluate content, criterion and construct validity of Oxford assessments against 1.b. to develop a refined battery of items based on the psychometric analyses 1.c. to develop a shorter and harmonized set of items that have good psychometric properties Aim 2. To develop a common dementia risk score in each country based on the additional information gathered from proxy/informants and a clinical evaluation. This risk score will be harmonized and validated."
"9242842","ABSTRACT  Diagnostic errors are estimated to affect 12 million patients in the U.S. each year and are an important source of preventable morbidity and mortality. One study concluded most errors involved process breakdowns in the patient-provider clinical encounter (78.9%), based on review of the EHR, but there are no studies linking diagnostic errors with actual observation of clinical encounters. Literature on diagnostic process is largely based on experiments using simulated situations, or experience in medical education. Diagnostic errors are commonly ascribed to cognitive biases or synthesis errors on the part of the physician, but in fact the clinical encounter is a dyadic interaction in which a patient complaint ordinarily initiates the diagnostic process and patient reports are an important source of information. The information patients volunteer, questions physicians ask and how they ask them, how patients express information, patients own opinions, all may be contribute to the diagnostic outcome. Linking recordings of outpatient encounters with subsequent information about diagnostic accuracy is a logistical challenge in that is impossible to know in advance what encounters will result in errors. However, members of our group have been involved in studies in which hundreds of encounters were audio recorded. It is feasible to record even larger numbers of encounters with the stipulation that only those in which diagnostic performance issues are subsequently identified will be analyzed.  As preliminary work, we will generate descriptive information about real-world diagnostic processes using 147 transcripts of outpatient encounters we have previously collected and coded for other purposes. The coding systems isolate provider's information gathering processes, and diagnostic and treatment outcomes, with detailed information about elements such as symptoms, lab tests, physical examination, disease labels, and interactions within the diagnostic process ? e.g., types of questions, information giving, expression of goals or affect, concern, reassurance, and instructions. Physical examinations can be deduced from the dialogue, and physicians generally announce their observations. We will build on the existing coding, specifically focusing on diagnostic processes. We will examine the diagnostic process within the clinical encounter and identify points of vulnerability for diagnostic failure such as premature closure, presumptive interpretation of ambiguous representations, or discounting of inconsistent evidence.  The long term goal of this research is to develop and test physician, patient, and system-focused interventions to improve diagnostic accuracy in primary care and other routine outpatient care. The objective of this proposal is to analyze diagnosis-related elements of the clinical encounter for vulnerabilities, develop a taxonomy of diagnostic process failures identified and understand diagnostic performance within the patient- provider encounter using existing audiotaped data. Our team includes both social science expertise in analysis of communication, and clinical expertise in diagnosis."

"9107587","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Postnatal cell fates are determined by adult stem cells residing in regenerative tissues such as ectoderm appendages. While their differentiation capacity has been demonstrated extensively, mechanisms that specify cell fate remain poorly understood. Mouse incisor provides an excellent model system to study adult stem cell fate in a regenerating tissue. Incisor stem cells support the continuous growth of the incisors throughout the lifespan of the mouse. Slow dividing dental epithelial stem cells (DE-SC) residing in the cervical loop specify the dental program and regenerate the dental epithelia. The stem cell fate and regeneration are primarily controlled by a specific transcriptional program. We developed a unique stem cell regeneration model, in which the transcriptional program for ectoderm appendages such as tooth and skin is converted. Genomic deletion of one subunit of the transcriptional coactivator Mediator complex, Mediator 1 (Med1), resulted in enamel hypoplasia, in which DE-SCs fail to institute the transcriptional program for a normal dental epithelial fate. Instead, DE-SCs institute an epidermal program and regenerate ectopic hairs in the incisors associated with extended Sox2 expression and reduced Notch signaling. Given these striking preliminary results we hypothesize that the Mediator regulates the transcription factors that control the cell fate of dental stem cells. Med1 deletion alters the pre-existing transcription program for dental fate resulting in a new state of epidermal/hair fate specific transcription. Further study of the Med1 null model will allow us to identify genetic Med1 targets, fate determining transcription factors, through genome wide analyses using microarray and Chip-sequencing (Aim1). We anticipate that these analyses will reveal specific enhancer domains called super-enhancers in which Med1 is highly recruited to organize fate specific chromatin states. We also aim to determine the functionality of these Med1 targets and regulatory molecules including Sox2 and Notch1/Hes1 (Aim2). We will use siRNA mediated gene silencing and overexpression of Med1 and Med1 target genes identified in Aim 1 to determine their role in dental and epidermal cell fate as monitored by lineage specific markers in in vitro culture system. We will then determine their role in 3D co-culture of DE-SC/mesenchyme resembling in vivo stem cell niche system by considering the contribution of dental mesenchyme. Successful completion of this study is expected to uncover a specific transcription program that drives dental cell fate, and more broadly provide insight into the differentiation of ectodermal tissues."
"9219412","Recent improvements in measures of patient safety in nursing homes look, at first glance, like a monumental policy success. The reported percent of nursing home residents suffering pressure sores, falls, and urinary tract infections decreased dramatically since the early 2000s, when policymakers began numerous initiatives focused on improving nursing home quality. However, skepticism has emerged as to whether the improved performance on patient safety measures truly reflects improvements in residents? outcomes or, alternatively, simply reflects changes in documentation since the data for the patient safety measures are self-reported by nursing homes. Policymakers interested in improving outcomes and maximizing the usefulness of the patient safety measures share this skepticism, especially in cases where performance on patient safety measures is not matched by performance on other established measures of quality. Several recent New York Times articles drew national attention to the issue, highlighting several cases where consumers felt misled by high quality ratings into choosing nursing homes that fell far short of expectations. Whether reported improvements in patient safety reflect true improvements in nursing home resident outcomes has particular import for disparities in the quality of nursing home care. It is well known that nursing homes with a high proportion of Medicaid residents, often located in poor neighborhoods and disproportionately serving members of racial and ethnic minority groups, provide lower quality of care on average. Although high- Medicaid nursing homes had notable improvements in many patient safety measures over the past two decades, if this performance does not reflect resident well-being and outcomes, these scores may mask the need for real quality improvement and do little to address disparities in nursing home care. Our overall objective in this mixed-methods study is to assess whether and how nursing homes are improving patient safety, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence as to how high-performing and high- improving nursing homes achieve these scores. By correlating this performance with other well-established measures of quality and potential mechanisms for improvement, we will gain insight as to whether these improvements are meaningful and whether they are equitably distributed. To address the first three Aims, we propose econometric analysis of multiple merged data sets for 2011-2014. The fourth Aim will entail primary qualitative data collection through interviews and observation of nursing homes. Our results will directly inform 1) how consumers should interpret nursing home performance on patient safety measures; 2) how policymakers might refine the measures and identify nursing homes in which performance on the measures may be less reliable; and 3) best practices for meaningful improvement."
"9324389","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches."

"9176813","Project Summary  Alcohol addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive alcohol-seeking and the emergence of a negative emotional state (allostasis) that leads to dependence on alcohol. Alcohol use disorders are associated with a persistent dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and corticotropin- releasing factor (CRF) signaling that leads to inappropriate responses to stress, thereby increasing relapse susceptibility in abstinent alcoholics. Although research has progressed to better understand the detrimental relationship between the allostatic HPA axis response to stress and alcohol relapse, the cellular mechanisms underlying the HPA axis allostatic response to stress in EtOH-dependence remain unclear and warrant further investigation in order to develop the much needed novel therapies to treat alcoholism and the consequent alcohol-related diseases. Stress information is processed in higher brain regions and converged onto parvocellular neurosecretory cells (PNCs) within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) which represents the final central integrative and output step of HPA axis response. Stress induces multiple distinct forms of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic plasticity of PNCs which depend on different mediators of the stress-induced HPA axis response such as CRF, NMDAR, cortisol/corticosterone (CORT) and norepinephrine (NE) within the PVN. These different forms of stress-induced synaptic plasticity provide a cellular mechanism by which stress induces neuroadaptive responses of the HPA axis. Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment alters CORT-mediated negative feedback, NE, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurotransmissions leading to a dysregulated HPA axis function. Preliminary results show that CIE exposure increases NMDAR function and prevents CRF-induced depression of NMDAR function in PNCs. Moreover, stress-induced CRF/NMDAR- dependent glutamatergic short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is impaired in PNCs of CIE rats but is restored after inhibition of NMDAR function. We also related the impairment of STP in PNCs to dysregulated HPA axis hormonal (CORT and ACTH) and grooming (behavioral) responses to repeated stressors. Thus, the main hypothesis of this proposal is that CIE exposure leads to the alteration of CRF-mediated NMDAR- dependent synaptic plasticity, which together with alterations in NE, CORT, and GABA signaling in the PVN is responsible for the HPA axis allostatic response to stress in EtOH dependence. To test this hypothesis we will use a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, biochemical and pharmacological techniques to determine: 1) the role of NMDAR, 2) CORT, and 3) NE in CIE-induced neuroadaptive changes in PNCs and the maladaptive behavioral and hormonal HPA responses to repeated stress, and 4) the intra-PVN role of NMDAR, CORT, and NE signaling in excessive EtOH intake, decreased stress-induced grooming, and stress-induced increases in EtOH intake of CIE rats."
"9271454","Even in HIV-infected individuals on active anti-retroviral therapy (ART), low-level viral replication and inflammation persists in both the periphery and in the central nervous system (CNS). HIV enters the brain early and there is compelling evidence that the brain is a putative reservoir for HIV that is responsible for the neuropathogenic sequelae. Indeed, even with ART, the prevalence and incidence of HAND remains high. While progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of HAND under conditions of high viral load, the hosts? inflammatory responses to low-level chronic systemic infection and how this exacerbates neuronal injury and dysfunction in the brain are incompletely understood. Osteopontin (OPN), an early marker of inflammation is elevated in HAND. OPN may be a key intercellular signaling linker between neurons, macrophages/microglia and astrocytes in the CNS. We, and other groups, found that OPN is increased in HAND, even in those on therapy. OPN is significantly expressed in astrocytes, microglia and neurons in HAND. Thus, OPN increases in response to HIV infection. These findings suggest that OPN is a putative contributor to neuropathogenic processes in HAND. A feedback loop exists between OPN and HIV. Indeed, we showed a strong relationship between viral gene expression and the induction of OPN. Knockdown of OPN in macrophages led to a 50% reduction in HIV production, suggesting that this cytokine stimulates viral replication. Indeed inhibition of OPN blocks HIV transcription and replication in macrophages. Our findings show that OPN enhances HIV replication through NF-?B and via activation of OPN receptors, integrins and CD44. In macrophages, OPN is required for the downstream activation of mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), innate and inflammatory pathways, implicated in HAND. Together, our data suggests that OPN is an important regulator of both HIV replication and proinflammatory signaling in cells of the CNS. Hence, it is critical that we understand OPN signaling and downstream inflammatory cascades in order to develop new therapeutic interventions. Our central hypothesis is that in the context of systemic HIV infection, OPN expression in activated macrophages/microglia, astrocytes and neurons promotes integrin and CD44 signaling cascades resulting in chronic inflammation and subsequent injury of neurons. A three-pronged approach will be used to explore our hypothesis: 1) in vivo, using HIV-infected NOD-scid IL-2R? mouse engrafted with human hCD34+. In this model, several key neuropathological hallmarks seen in HAND are observed, it allows persistent HIV replication, and mice can be treated with antivirals, 2) in vitro, using primary macrophage, neuronal, and astrocytic cultures to deconstruct the molecular mechanisms, and 3) ex vivo, using human brain postmortem tissue to validate experimental findings. We expect that the new knowledge gained will allow for future translational studies aimed at alleviating neuronal and cognitive damage in HAND. This is especially important as to date, no viable adjunctive therapy has yet been identified."
"9255902","ABSTRACT The broad objective of this CRP proposal is to conduct an intellectual property landscape study for the use of fluorescent diamonds in biomedical and pharmaceutical markets. NV-center nanodiamonds exhibit bright, highly stable fluorescence which extends into the near infrared spectral region. They are biocompatible, never fade, photobleach or blink and show fluorescence that is much brighter than commonly used organic dyes. These features make fluorescent nanodiamonds ideally suited for drug delivery and biomedical imaging applications, such as cell labeling, cell tracking, and fiducial marking for super resolution microscopy. Fluorescent diamonds and nanodiamonds have additional and essentially untapped applications in other markets such as field sensors, spintronics, and in anti-counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, implants and diagnostic kits. While the opportunity for fluorescent nanodiamonds appears lucrative, there were no commercial sources of fluorescent nanodiamonds until Columbus NanoWorks received a Phase I SBIR contract to produce fluorescent nanodiamonds on a commercial scale. We are currently in month 6 of our Phase II SBIR contract to continue this work as well as develop additional diamond color centers. A major area that now requires our attention is understanding the IP landscape for fluorescent diamonds. We are requesting funding from the Commercialization Readiness Program to carefully conduct an intellectual property search and landscape analysis focused on compositions, production methods and applications of use for fluorescent diamonds and nanodiamonds. As fluorescent diamonds and nanodiamonds are new, we believe that the IP surrounding them will be fairly limited and that an IP landscape search will strengthen our position in this market. This study will enable us to advance and protect our products and maximize our commercial competitive potential. A deeper understanding of the intellectual property in the fluorescent nanodiamond space will allow us to maneuver our development efforts for the greatest benefit, develop productive partnerships and attract investors, and develop technical solutions and business strategies to avoid freedom to practice/infringement risks."
"9194003","The University of Minnesota (UMN) Udall Center will focus on understanding the electrophysiological features that underlie the motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD) and developing new deep brain stimulation (DBS) strategies to treat them. This will be accomplished in humans through a combination of intra-operative microelectrode and post-operative local field potential (LFP) recordings using the Medtronic RC+S ?Brain Radio?, and DBS therapy implemented through the lens of novel targets and stimulation paradigms. These data will be complemented in nonhuman primates, by the development and electrophysiological characterization of optimization tools for improving subject-specific precision of DBS therapy. Specifically, the first goal (Project 1) is to enhance our understanding of the pathophysiological basis of PD motor signs by clarifying the changes in synchronized oscillatory activity that occur within the pallidum and STN at rest and during movement under conditions that improve and worsen motor signs (during DBS or following administration of levo-dopa). These data will provide the rationale for the development of novel DBS paradigms and targets. The second goal (Project 2) is to identify the physiological signatures associated with dopa-responsive and resistant motor features of PD, use MRI-derived computational models to examine the pathways mediating the behavioral changes and investigate alternative DBS targets and stimulation paradigms to treat these motor signs. The third goal (Project 3) is to leverage the well-established MPTP nonhuman primate model of PD to identify unconventional DBS settings that increase the window between successful therapy and emergence of side effects, develop closed-loop strategies for tuning DBS settings to maximize the therapeutic effect on individual parkinsonian motor signs, and investigate how the level of therapy depends on electrophysiological changes in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem. Critical to all three projects is the ability to accurately determine DBS lead and contact locations, and develop model based predictions of which motor pathways are activated during stimulation (Imaging Core). Clinical and quantitative motor assessments will be obtained (Clinical Core) and correlated to physiological data obtained acutely in the operating room, subacutely in patients whose leads are externalized and chronically through postoperative assessments using the Medtronic RC+S ?Brain Radio?. The Biostatistics Core will provide study design, logistics planning, overall data management, quality control and statistical analysis, as well as data integration with and transfer to the NIH/NINDS Data Management Resource. The Administrative Core will support all aspects of the UMN Udall Center, implement and support patient education and public outreach efforts and provide training for the next generation of PD researchers. Together, these approaches will provide critical data towards the development and translation of novel patient-specific DBS therapies."

"9336110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) was created in 2005 to evaluate the clinical course of perinatally acquired HIV infection among adolescents and pre-adolescents and the consequences of fetal and neonatal exposure to HIV and antiretroviral chemotherapy among a representative cohort of children in the United States. PHACS is comprised of a Scientific Leadership Group (SLG), which is overseen by a Coordinating Center, a Data and Operations Center (DOC), and 22 clinical units (CU). The Department of Epidemiology and the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research at the Harvard School of Public Health, Westat, and the Frontier Science Foundation form the PHACS DOC. The DOC collaborates with the SLG to define the PHACS research agenda; provides methodological leadership for the development of all PHACS analytic projects; maintains CU subcontracts and trains and monitors sites in proper procedures for PHACS research; plans and conducts all leadership and full PHACS network meetings; develops HIV- and health- related educational materials and opportunities for the PHACS community; and, supports an active Community Advisory Board. The Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP), a cohort of 450 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and preadolescents age 7-16 at enrollment, was established to investigate the impact of HIV and ART on organ systems, growth and development, sexual maturation, pubertal development, cognition, emotional development, and socialization; AMP Up was subsequently designed to extend follow-up of AMP participants and other HIV-infected young adults who have reached 18 years of age using a streamlined, mobile-friendly protocol. A drug toxicity surveillance system, Surveillance Monitoring for Anti-Retroviral Toxicities (SMART), has enrolled 3,506 perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected children to evaluate long-term effects of in-utero ART exposure. In PHACS III, the DOC will continue to carry out the PHACS scientific agenda in an increasing efficient manner, enrolling and following an additional 1,000 newborns into SMARTT and an additional 525 HIV-infected and HIV-exposed, uninfected young adults into AMP Up. Together, HSPH, Westat and Frontier Science bring a long and successful history of providing the scientific and operational leadership required by PHACS, as well as innovative methods to enhance and maximize the efficiency of the PHACS study design, conduct, and analyses. Given our prior experience we are uniquely positioned to continue to provide the scientific/epidemiologic and operational leadership essential to the continued success of PHACS."
"9228585","Project Summary With improved technologies, overdiagnosis has become a major threat to both health care efficiency and quality of care. Perhaps no condition illustrates overdiagnosis better than thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising, with most patients having an excellent prognosis. There is a large reservoir of indolent thyroid cancer, with potential for detecting disease that will not lead to death. We previously showed a marked rise in use of post-diagnosis imaging for thyroid cancer, and we hypothesize that a rise in pre-diagnosis imaging, both thyroid-targeted and imaging associated with incidental cancer discovery, is uncovering malignancies that would never cause harm. The discovery of this low-risk thyroid cancer has the greatest implications for women, who represent close to 75% of all thyroid cancer cases, and older adults, who have the highest thyroid cancer incidence per 100,000, the most growth in incidence, and the greatest risks from subsequent treatments. In this study, we will use Medicare claims data and linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data to determine the contribution of imaging to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in older adults. In Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between county-level imaging intensity and both thyroid cancer incidence and disease severity. We hypothesize that regional imaging practices will be strong determinants of thyroid cancer incidence. Moreover, we posit that the major determinant of the increase in low-risk disease will be an increase in the use of imaging associated with incidental cancer discovery. In Aim 2, we will determine the drivers of the imaging, including determining the role of physician and patient level factors. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the clinical implications of the imaging, specifically population attributable mortality. We anticipate that the rise in cancer incidence secondary to changes in imaging practices will not be associated with population-level improvements in survival. The results of this study will clarify the relationship between imaging, both thyroid-targeted and imaging associated with incidental cancer discovery, and the rise in thyroid cancer incidence. These findings will be used to develop a clinical strategy to minimize the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer and to serve as a model for overdiagnosis in general."
"9030144","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms by which hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia contribute to diabetic retinopathy (DR) pathology remain largely undefined. However, considerable experimental evidence points to the involvement of a group of pro-inflammatory cytokines. During early stages of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), increased retinal levels of these inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF?, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-8) are observed before visible signs of retinal vascular pathology. In animal models of DR, these up-regulated cytokines have been shown to elicit inflammatory responses from retinal vascular cells, evidenced by increased expression of adhesion proteins by endothelium (e.g., VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin) and apoptosis markers by pericytes (e.g., caspase-3, Annexin-V). These responses promote retinal vascular leukostasis and pericyte death, two hallmarks of NPDR. Recently, two families of endogenous epoxygenated lipids, the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs), have been shown to inhibit production of soluble pro-inflammatory mediators, as well as pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic responses to these mediators, in a variety of cell types. EETs and EDPs are the products of arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid metabolism, respectively, by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase enzymes. Through their inhibitory actions on cytokine production and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, EETs and EDPs exhibit potent anti- inflammatory properties before being hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to diol products, which are much less biologically active. It is widely reported from studies in non-ocular tissues, that a number of diabetes-relevant stimuli cause down-regulation of EET/EDP-producing CYP enzymes and up-regulation of sEH, thus lowering tissue EET/EDP levels and mitigating their anti-inflammatory activities. Both the EET/EDP- producing CYP enzymes and the EET/EDP-degrading sEH enzyme are expressed in the retina and are localized to capillary endothelial cells, mural cells and Müller glia. Given ths background, and based on our own preliminary findings, we hypothesize the following: Under non-diabetic conditions, when retinal CYP and sEH expression levels are normal, EETs and EDPs block cytokine production by glial and vascular cells. Under diabetic conditions, CYP-dependent EET/EDP production is reduced, while sEH-dependent EET/EDP degradation is increased, resulting in lowered retinal EET/EDP levels and increased cytokine production. We hypothesize that by therapeutically elevating EET/EDP levels we will restore the normal EET/EDP balance, and block cytokine production and related downstream pathogenic events. We propose to test this hypothesis using both pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of retinal EET and EDP levels in relevant retinal cells and in an animal model of DR. While this is a completely novel therapeutic strategy for inhibiting DR pathology, we believe it is strongly supported by the literature and our own preliminary data."
"9179898","Project Summary: I propose a 4-year mentored research training program to become a leader in the field of pediatric emergency care research. I am residency-trained in Emergency Medicine and fellowship-trained in Pediatric Emergency Medicine and am currently Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. My research focuses on improving safety in the out-of-hospital care of pediatric patients. This proposal focuses specifically on improving the safety of pediatric airway management during out-of-hospital emergencies and studying the efficacy of supraglottic airway devices. My career development plan will provide me advanced skills in decision science, qualitative research, biostatistics, exception from informed consent, and clinical trial design that are critical to advance this field and my career. The training will come through formal coursework, mentored research, experiential learning, focused reading programs, and scientific meetings. The overall objective of this proposal is to test whether supraglottic airway devices are superior to endotracheal intubation and bag-valve-mask ventilation for out-of-hospital pediatric airway management. Endotracheal intubation, a complex and invasive procedure, is the single most common out-of- hospital advanced airway technique and the gold standard in the hospital. However, up to 50% of out-of- hospital pediatric endotracheal intubations are complicated by endotracheal tube misplacement and/or dislodgement, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or damage to airway structures. Bag-valve-mask ventilation is less invasive but challenging in the out-of-hospital environment given the need to provide care in a moving vehicle. There is critical need for a new approach that reduces complications and is effective in oxygenation and ventilation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is to understand whether supraglottic airway devices, commonly used in children in the operating room, are more effective than endotracheal intubation and bag-valve-mask ventilation for out-of-hospital emergency airway management. To test this hypothesis we will 1) examine the efficacy of supraglottic airway devices being used by paramedics in simulation lab and operating room environments; 2) conduct a qualitative study to understand the decision making process used in out-of-hospital pediatric airway management and identify potential barriers to implementation of supraglottic airway devices; and 3) conduct a prospective observational study to determine how the airway management strategy affects CPR quality and medication administration in pediatric out-of- hospital cardiac arrest. This research will help improve out-of-hospital pediatric airway management by helping understand how individual device characteristics, provider factors, and clinical context affect the efficacy and safety of airway management techniques."
"9245294","  Project Summary/Abstract Human ring chromosomes are abnormal structures formed by intrachromosomal fusions, creating a circular chromosome. Ring chromosome syndrome is a debilitating disorder resulting in severe drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectually disabilities (IQ <70), and developmental delay. Ring chromosome patients and families deal with life-long challenges of prolonged seizures, learning and memory issues, severe psychological disruption, and a feeling of powerlessness, resulting in a great deal of stress and strain. Clinically this disorder affects multiple organ systems including the brain (microcephaly, early onset epilepsy, and intellectual disabilities), the eye, the immune system, and growth. Our laboratory and others, have focused on mapping and characterizing the molecular and cytogenetics of ring chromosome structures; however, to date no published studies have focused on investigating the cellular neuropathology due to lack of appropriate models. To investigate this disorder, we have created a large biobank of cell lines from ring chromosome 14 (r(14)) patients and family members. From these cell lines, we have produced the only model available by generating patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells, which provide the foundation for studying this devastating disorder that lacks alternative models. In our preliminary work, we find that by differentiating ring chromosome iPSCs toward a forebrain fate we can generate populations of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) that can be further differentiated into post-mitotic neurons. Neuronal precursor cells harboring the ring chromosome 14 have reduced cellular growth and decreased expression of key telencephalon neuronal markers. Interestingly, a number of genes located on chromosome 14 are involved in neuronal differentiation or maintenance, leading us to postulate that the ring structure modifies expression of this key gene responsible for in vitro cortical cell generation. We have also begun to generate an in vitro cerebral cortex organoid model, which will be important for studying the early embryonic events perturbed in a R(14) developmental model. Mammalian genomes are organized in distinct architectures which allow for the orchestration of proper gene and epigenetic regulation. Our proposed studies will identify ring chromosome 14 orientation in the nucleus, epigenetic marks on chromosome 14, and establish a 3-dimensional (3D) cerebral cortex developmental model for studying phenotypes of Ring chromosome 14 syndrome. We hypothesize that the altered higher order chromosome structure resulting from ring formation disrupts normal chromatin compaction, looping, localization within the nucleus and ultimately gene regulation. The proposed work will provide important tools for studying R(14) syndrome, and yield a comprehensive view of the role a ring chromosome has on DNA positioning, chromatin modifications, and in vitro neuronal development. In addition, this innovative model should provide a strong foundation for future work fully characterizing 3D organoid development in R(14) and provide essential reagents (neuronal tissues) to study the neural circuits and electrophysiological patterns in R(14) patient samples."
"9243005","Computational method for predicting passive permeability of naturally-sourced drugs ABSTRACT   The major obstacle to optimization of bioavailability of drug leads is the lack of a conceptual framework that adequately describes different aspects of drug-membrane interactions and predicts their ability to cross the hydrophobic barrier of the lipid bilayer. There is a critical need for development of a conceptual model and an efficient computational tool for quantification of passive permeability across membranes of diverse molecules, including naturally-sourced compounds with properties that lie outside physicochemical parameters of drug-like molecules. The proposed research is in line with our long-term goal: to develop computational methods and resources for studying solute-solvent interactions and spatial distributions of molecules in biological membranes, which can assist in design of new therapeutics to treat human diseases. The objective in this proposal is to develop and validate a novel physics-based approach for predicting Permeability of Molecules through Membranes (PerMM) and organelle targeting. The method will perform all-atom modeling of binding and passive diffusion of biomolecules in natural membranes with highly anisotropic and asymmetric properties. The first specific aim is to create the PerMM method and implement it in an open-access web server that will calculate the following parameters for a specified compound and a selected membrane type: (1) the membrane binding energy and penetration depth; (2) the lowest energy pathway across the membrane; (3) the permeability coefficient; and (4) the molecular flux across the membrane in the presence of surface and transmembrane electric potentials and pH gradient. The results obtained for various biological membranes will allow prediction of compound accumulation in a specific cell compartment. The second aim is to apply the newly designed server for the systematic evaluation of permeability through different biomembranes, including the blood-brain barrier, of naturally-sourced drugs with focus on peptide-derived compounds. The server will also assist in optimization of bioavailability of opioid peptides and peptidomimetics with analgesic activity, which are currently under development in the laboratory of Dr. Mosberg (UM). The proposed research is expected to have a high impact on the field of drug design, optimization, and targeted delivery using lipid- based systems.  "
"9242449","ABSTRACT Candidate: This candidate has a relevant clinical background, solid research experience working on the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) intervention development, an extremely strong publication record with several being published in high impact journals, and highly recommended letters of reference. Her research has revealed multiple end of life (EOL) concerns of patients/family caregivers. Unfortunately many of these concerns continue today. Her proposed research is designed to test ways to gain broad support for the early and uniform initiation of palliative care to overcome this barrier. Her long-term goal is to become a successful independent academic researcher who designs and tests interventions to improve palliative care preparedness of patients with life-limiting illness and their family caregivers. The proposed training program will include didactic and clinical instruction in communication theory, palliative care decision-making and the design and implementation of clinical research projects. The planned development program includes a mentored practicum at the University of Washington, an intensive 2-week Palliative Care Course at Harvard University, multidisciplinary seminars and training from mentors providing specific expertise. Environment: The work environment at the University of Pittsburgh Dorothy P. & Richard P. Simmons Center for Interstitial Lung Disease at UPMC is an extremely strong clinical environment abundant in both physical and intellectual resources. The environment is strengthened by appropriate activities at Harvard and University of Washington. Research: IPF is a disease of aging associated with intense medical and financial burden and expected to grow in incidence within the US population. Median survival from diagnosis is 3.8 years, although some patients succumb to a rapid death within 6 months. New therapies have recently become available. While these medications slow the rate of pulmonary deterioration, they have no impact on ultimate survival or quality of life. Although transplantation is an effective surgical therapy, less than 20% of patients ever receive a lung transplant. The remaining 80% have few treatment options and a likely rapidly progressive downhill course. Despite the fatal prognosis, we have found that patients and caregivers often fail to understand the poor prognosis as the disease relentlessly progresses. At the end of life, IPF patients and their caregivers experience stress, symptom burden, poor quality of life, and inadequate preparedness for end-of-life care planning. The proposed study will measure feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a Supportive Care intervention. Patients with IPF and their caregivers will be randomized to receive this intervention or usual care. The intervention will include information about the disease, self-management strategies, and introduction to advanced care planning in a format with enhanced content available across multiple domains (face-to-face, printed material, digital (tablet) delivered by an interventionist. The usual care group will be provided with routine printed patient education. The Specific Aims include: Aim 1: Determine feasibility (as measured by recruitment and retention rate) of the Supportive Care intervention for IPF patients and caregivers. Aim 2: Determine the acceptability of the Supportive Care intervention on knowledge regarding disease, self- management and treatment strategies for patients and their caregivers. Aim 3: Assess impact of the Supportive Care intervention on patient stress, symptom burden, quality of life, and completion of advanced care planning as compared to care as usual. The overarching goal of this proposal is determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of an early, integrated palliative care intervention, hereafter termed Supportive Care, in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and their caregivers that will positively impact their experiences at the end-of-life (EOL). By increasing knowledge of the disease, teaching self-management strategies, and facilitating preparedness with EOL planning, we will begin to address a critical gap in the care of not just IPF patients but also all patients with advanced lung disease (high medical utilization and high symptom burden in the face of a fatal illness)."
"9214546","Poverty disproportionately impacts minority and rural populations and is very strongly correlated with poor health over the life cycle, and has been hypothesized to lead to a shorter, less healthy aging process. Poverty is associated with a greater burden of disease than smoking and obesity combined and accounts for the bulk of health disparities by race. It is widely believed that an anti-poverty policy?such as Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)?could improve healthy aging among working-age low-income adults over the life cycle. It does so by increasing material hardship and psychological stress?two risk factors that are strongly correlated with biological markers of premature aging (e.g., shorter telomeres, higher cholesterol levels, and higher blood pressure.) However, the literature linking poverty to health is largely built on correlational data, which is subject to confounding and reverse causation. The experienced research firm MDRC has secured private and public funding for a groundbreaking multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that examines the causal impacts of quadrupling EITC for working adults without dependent children in Atlanta, GA and New York City, NY called Paycheck Plus (PP). Randomization exposes the treatment group to up to $2000 in PP compared to up to $496 in the control group. However, MDRC is not studying the impacts of PP on health. We propose leveraging MDRC?s existing infrastructure and our long history of collaboration with MDRC to add clinical, survey, and administrative measures to explore whether PP improves the health and survival of adult recipients without dependent children. Timed with launch of the study in Atlanta, we propose in-person health screenings with collection of important biomarkers of chronic disease, such as blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood glucose, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (measures that are conceptually linked to poverty). For both the NYC and Atlanta Cohorts, we propose adding survey data that measures health-related quality of life and depression. Since not everybody randomized to the treatment group will file taxes (a requisite for the treated group to receive PP or the control group to receive traditional EITC), we will analyze our health outcomes using an Intent to Treat (ITT) versus Treatment on the Treated (ToT) analysis. This will produce Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) estimates of the unbiased impact of increased PP on health. In addition, we will collect long-term follow up data on mortality for both treatment sites. We will do so by linking individual identifiers administrative mortality data from the National Death Index. Finally, we will model the health and longevity gains associated with PP relative to traditional EITC. This project is innovative for exploiting a planned and fully funded social science experiment to explore outcome measures that were not originally considered by the policymakers. This project is also innovative for being a RTC of an anti-poverty program that uses administrative and clinical health data at a very low cost. We anticipate that PP will be an efficient approach to promoting healthy aging by lifting adults without dependent children out of poverty."
"9275102","A large percentage of drug candidates fail at the clinical trial stage due to a lack of efficacy and unacceptable toxicity, primarily because the in vitro cell culture models and in vivo animal models commonly used in preclinical studies provide limited information about how a drug will affect human physiology. The need for more physiologically relevant in vitro systems for preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing has led to a major effort to develop ?Microphysiological Systems (MPS)? based on engineered human tissue constructs. The MPS development process requires an initial assessment of viability and functionality, followed by an examination of the MPS response to various stimuli, including drugs, toxins, and disease-related cues. These extensive development efforts take place mainly in the developer's lab, and the reproducibility of the MPS results are rarely assessed by an independent research group or transferred to industry partners for use in drug development.  Although there is a need for more physiologically-relevant preclinical testing technologies, the transition of MPS technologies from academia to industry remains challenging. Successful transfer and deployment of MPS technologies requires quantitative characterization and validation of the systems, preferably by an independent and unbiased external testing facility. We propose to fill this gap between academic research and development and industrial application of MPS technologies with our proposed Translational Center for Tissue Chip Technologies, which will provide unbiased testing and validation of MPS technologies as reflected in the current RFA.  Our proposed Translational Center for Tissue Chip Technologies will take a holistic and mechanistic approach?based on quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)?that combines quantitative experimental biology, computational biology, and biostatistics to achieve unbiased characterization of these complex systems and translation of experimental insights to clinical outcomes. Our translational systems pharmacology team at MIT includes tissue engineers, experimentalists, and computational biologists and will serve as the core of the proposed testing center. This multidisciplinary team is highly experienced in MPS technology testing and will be responsible for model-guided experimental design, experimental execution, data acquisition in collaboration with partner sites, data analysis, and reporting. The administrative organization and supporting infrastructure of our proposed testing center, as well as our systematic approach and workflows, will lead to transparent and unbiased MPS testing that will not only help researchers as they further develop and optimize their MPS technologies, but also ensure adoption of well-characterized and independently validated MPS platforms by industry to use in drug development and toxicology testing and government agencies to use in the regulatory decision-making process."
"9222552","Abstract Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), a cell-free DNA screening test of fetal chromosomal abnormalities using maternal plasma, has been heralded as ?revolutionizing prenatal screening and diagnosis.? Introduced commercially in late 2011, the rapid clinical adoption of NIPT highlights genomic medicine?s growth and enormous promise for patient care. The research landscape stemming from genomic and precision medicine endeavors, however, necessitates concomitant efforts to monitor population health impact and assure equity in access to these advances. Although genomic discovery has accelerated at a rapid pace, the corresponding rate of research examining the effectiveness of genomics translation into clinical or public health practice has lagged behind. It has been estimated that over 100,000 NIPTs have been performed in the United States as of 2014. Yet, the literature to date on the adoption of NIPT is from convenience samples from single clinic settings. Currently, there is a glaring paucity of population-based evidence on utilization of and patient benefits from NIPT. The existing evidence base is not sufficient to draw a clear picture of the population-level trends in NIPT adoption, particularly among vulnerable subpopulations by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and insurance coverage. As such, there is no information on the extent of inequities in NIPT use and impact. Using a uniquely comprehensive healthcare database covering all Massachusetts residents aged 18-64, we propose to measure documented NIPT use and gains realized from reduction of conventional invasive diagnostic testing among the overall population and across diverse subpopulations by socioeconomic status (SES), race/ ethnicity, and insurance coverage. The database captures the entire spectrum of maternity care covering prenatal visits, NIPT, genetic counseling, chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. The specific aims of this study are to 1) estimate annual population rate of use of NIPT during 2012-2015 among all pregnant women and among subgroups based on maternal age, SES, race/ethnicity and insurance; 2) develop a person-level model to identify the multilevel factors associated with NIPT uptake (i.e., patient, provider, hospital and geographic area), and examine the extent to which the model accounts for disparities in NIPT uptake by SES, race/ethnicity and insurance; and 3) examine the association between NIPT adoption and use of invasive diagnostic testing, and variation in this association by SES, race/ethnicity and insurance. The proposed study will generate population-based evidence that will inform a range of stakeholders ? pregnant women, providers, professional societies, payers, and state policymakers ? on the extent to which anticipated benefits of NIPT have been realized across different subpopulations, and identify potential barriers and facilitators to address inequities that may be arising from the introduction of NIPT. Findings will be important for evaluation of new advances in genomic medicine based on equity in accessibility and patient impact."

"9156099","ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.     "
"9171923","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S. nearly 275,000 people are hospitalized for traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year and with hospitalization, the TBI patient encounters a care environment that is not always supportive of recovery. As a part of the clinical care continuum, intermediate-care is the last rung of inpatient hospitalization and is often where an interdisciplinary team evaluates a patient's recovery from brain injury. The environment of care can be a barrier or facilitator to recovery post-TBI because it influences physiologic processes such as sleep. In patients with TBI intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to sleep disturbance Extrinsic factors like hospital noise, timing and exposure to light, and nighttime awakenings by hospital staff are noted as salient problems in both hospitalized patients and patients with TBI. However the available literature on sleep disturbance of patients with TBI housed in the intermediate care unit is sparse. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study is to examine the pattern of the patient's sleep fragmentation together with environmental stimuli in order to describe the influence of the care environment on the intermediate-care patient with TBI. The patients number of nighttime awakenings will be recorded using actigraphy while environmental factors (sound, light, and contact (as part of care-provision) will be recorded with a sound level meter and a multipurpose sensor, respectively. Additionally, multilevel modeling analyses will be used describe associations of the patient's nighttime awakenings, environmental factors, and the change in functional status (measured with functional independence measure, FIM) measured at day 1, day 5, and at discharge from intermediate care."
"9000520","PROJECT-002 - LEUKEMIA RESEARCH PROGRAM (LR)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Leukemia Research (LR) Program within The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center  (OSUCCC) is co-led by two physician scientists; Drs. John C. Byrd and Michael R. Grever who bring together  34 peer-reviewed funded members from 9 Departments and 5 Colleges (Engineering, Pharmacy, Medicine,  Veterinary Medicine, and Arts & Sciences). The program is focused on the etiology, pathogenesis, prognosis,  and treatment of leukemia with emphasis on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), human T-cell lymphotrophic virus l  (HTLV-1) leukemia, large granular lymphocyte leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (CLL). LR Program-wide seminars, retreats, and disease-specific meetings provide an avenue for interaction  among scientists and physicians to improve the quality of scientific discovery made through research. The LR  Program integrates the use of novel technologies and translational and clinical support personnel provided  through OSUCCC shared resources to facilitate impactful discoveries that ultimately have the potential to  change the lives of patients with leukemia. LR Program discoveries span diagnostics through therapeutics,  many of which are actively tested in both investigator initiated clinical trials and also NCI sponsored Phase I  and II as well as cooperative group trials where our members have prominent leadership roles.  The Specific Aims of LR Program include: 1) to integrate genetic, epigenetic, RNA/protein, non-coding RNAs,  biochemical and immunosuppressive features of leukemic cells in order to enhance risk stratification and target  identification; and 2) to foster preclinical and clinical development of epigenetic, targeted molecular, and  immunologic therapeutics directed at the causes of leukemic transformation and progression.  LR Program members have published 557 manuscripts of which 48% are inter-programmatic, 53% are intra-  programmatic, 61% are multi-institutional; total collaborative publications are 93%. The Program has $8.7M in  annual direct costs of peer-reviewed funding of which $6.1M (70%) is from the NCI, including strong  programmatic funding in basic, translational, and clinical research. With regard to translational research, in five  years the LR Program members have accrued 1,660 patients to interventional clinical trials, 100% of which  were therapeutic accruals, and of those, 989, or 60%, were placed on investigator-initiated trials. Of the 1,660  patients accrued, 1,495 or 90% were on Phase I/II trials. LR Program members have led the development of  two therapeutic agents (ibrutinib and idelalisib) that were recently FDA approved for leukemia. Additionally, LR  Program members have developed two novel diagnostic tests that are now utilized in clinical practice. Our  future plans consist of targeted recruitment, continued enhancement of collaborative efforts, better molecular  classification of both AML and CLL for improvement in targeted therapies, and moving a number of preclinical  and clinical observations onto novel clinical trials."

"9340824","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nervous system is highly susceptible to the effects of age. Aging affects the nervous system in specific and deleterious ways. Aging neurons are less able to repair injury, less able to transmit information, less able to maintain their normal morphology, and are more prone to degeneration and neurodegenerative disease. However, despite the clear evidence for functional loss, the molecular mechanisms that mediate neuronal aging are obscure. This proposal addresses aging within neurons-that is, how do individual neurons respond to age, and how do they regulate this response? At the same time, the ways in which neuronal aging may affect overall lifespan are investigated. The project focuses in particular on the dramatic loss of neuronal ability to repair damaged axons that occurs with age, as well as other aspects of neuronal aging. Preliminary data identify novel and specific cell-biological processes that affect neuronal aging. The project will elucidate the detailed mechanisms that contribute to neuronal aging, test their interdependence, and examine whether different functional aspects of neuronal aging are regulated by different or by common mechanisms. Each Aim is supported by extensive preliminary data, as well as by novel biological concepts and experimental approaches. Completion of these Aims will describe fundamental cellular mechanisms that mediate neuronal aging, and contribute to a more complete understanding of aging in complex organisms with multiple tissue types."

"9255483","Summary Aging and hyperglycemia results in an accumulation of a series of reactive ?-dicarbonyl compounds (?-DCs, e.g. glyoxal/GO, methylglyoxal/MGO, 3-deoxyglucosone/3DG) and ?-DC-derived metabolites, called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs form due to the reaction of ?-DCs with proteins, lipids, and DNA causing cellular stress linked with specific age-related processes, diabetic complications and neurodegeneration. Therefore, preventing ?-DC and AGE buildup is of quintessential importance for slowing aging and limiting the progression of various age-related diseases. A major bottleneck in understanding the biochemistry behind the progression of these complications, and hence rapid drug development, is the lack of genetically tractable models that can recapitulate the effects of ?-DC and AGE accumulation in a short time frame. To that end, we have established a Caenorhabditis elegans model based on an impaired glyoxalase gene to study ?-DC and AGE-related pathologies. These animals exhibit several phenotypes reminiscent of diabetic complications, such as accumulation of MGO and AGEs, and hyperesthesia (or hyper sensitivity to touch), within two weeks of adulthood. Most interestingly they demonstrate increased age-related neuronal damage and shortened lifespan. Using this model we have identified a critical role for TRPA-1, a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel in sensing MGO and activating Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid-2 like 2, or NFE2L2) to counteract the effects of AGEs. A preliminary drug screen using this model has resulted in 2 promising compounds that can ameliorate AGE-related pathologies in C. elegans through TRPA-1/SKN-1 activation. We propose to use C. elegans as an invertebrate model to study the effects of AGE accumulation within two weeks which can take years to develop in humans, to allow rapid discovery of genetic and pharmacological targets relevant to aging and age-related diseases where AGEs play an important role. In this proposal we will: 1) Characterize the role of TRPA-1/ SKN-1 both genetically and pharmacologically in detoxifying MGO; 2) Characterize the glyoxalases downstream of SKN-1 that mediate detoxification of ?-DCs like MGO and 3) examine the conservation of the TRPA-1/SKN-1 pathway in detoxifying MGO in mammals using human neuronal cells. Together these aims will help to decipher the ?-DC detoxification network and identify therapeutic targets and novel compounds that can mitigate diabetic complications and extend healthspan of diabetics."
"9341564","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (RESEARCH PROJECT III)  The establishment of pregnancy requires acquisition of key competencies within the embryo and female  reproductive tract. Central to embryo competence is development of the trophoblast lineage, which represents  the initial differentiation event during embryogenesis. Trophoblast cells are situated at the embryo-uterine  interface and contribute fundamentally to the growth and survival of the embryo in the female reproductive  tract. These vital tasks are accomplished through appropriate expansion of trophoblast stem (TS) cells and  their accrual of specializations facilitating trophoblast modification of the uterine environment. Disruptions in  trophoblast lineage development are associated with implantation failure, recurrent pregnancy loss, and a  range of diseases affecting placentation, fetal growth, and postnatal development. Thus it is essential to  understand molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of TS cell renewal and differentiation.  Transcriptional and epigenetic regulators control these fundamental processes, which are conserved across  species utilizing hemochorial placentation. We have demonstrated the involvement of a defined set of histone  modifications in the process of TS cell renewal and differentiation. We propose that Suv39h2, a histone H3K9  methyl transferase, and Kdm3a, a histone H3K9 demethylase, can act as a developmental switches regulating  the TS cell stem state and acquisition of specialized trophoblast functions. Through chromatin modifications  such as those engineered by Suv39h2 and Kdm3a networks of genes can be activated or silenced. In this  project, three aims are proposed: 1) to evaluate the impact of histone H3K9 methylation machinery on TS cell  renewal and differentiation; 2) to identify gene networks linked to dynamic histone H3K9 methylation changes  during TS cell renewal and differentiation; 3) to elucidate transcription factor and co-regulator circuitry that  impacts histone H3K9 methylation machinery. The investigation utilizes in vitro stem cell models and in vivo rat  models to explore the role of histone H3K9 methylation in regulating the TS cell state. The proposed research  provides an innovative approach to study TS cell regulation and to expand our understanding of early  pregnancy loss."
"9142278","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 400,000 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures are performed every year in the United States (U.S.). Patients undergoing CABG surgery are at risk for a number of adverse sequelae, many of which impact survival and contribute to overall health-care costs. Healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs), including pneumonia and superficial and deep sternal wound infections, occur among 16% of CABG patients and elevate a patient's risk of mortality and add excess upfront and long-term expenditures to the health care system. A number of barriers prevent wide-scale improvements in HAI rates within the setting of CABG surgery. While a number of HAI prophylaxis measures have been developed, these measures do not fully encompass the set of practices that may impact a patient's risk of HAI. Identifying cardiac surgery specific risk factors would serve as th foundation for targeted quality improvement strategies. In the absence of definitive data concerning best practices, HAI prophylaxis is variable across surgeons and institutions, resulting in unnecessary morbidity and cost. Prior work has shown the value of implementing evidence-based protocols in the general intensive care unit setting. To what extent the implementation of cardiac surgery specific standardized practices results in lower HAI rates is uncertain. An understanding of the effectiveness of this approach would certainly assist surgeons and institutions in providing safer care to their patient populations. Rates of HAIs vary from 0-26% across the 33 institutions performing CABG surgery in Michigan. This application seeks to reduce this rate by identifying and subsequently implementing standardized practices, and evaluating their impact on HAI rates. This study will be based on the prospective data and regional quality improvement activities and infrastructure of the Michigan Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons Quality Collaborative (MSTCVS-QC). We will evaluate the effectiveness of these standardized practices in reducing HAIs regionally and relative to national rates during the same time period."
"9355332","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common solid tumor among American men and the second leading cause of cancer death. Surgery, radiation and active surveillance (AS) may all be appropriate treatments for men newly diagnosed with localized PCa. The 2008 AHRQ comparative effectiveness report on therapies for localized PCa determined that no one therapy can be considered the preferred treatment due to the limitations in the body of evidence as well as the likely tradeoffs an individual patient must make  between estimated treatment effectiveness, necessity and adverse effects. Simply put, there is a pressing need for additional and better studies on the comparative effectiveness of treatments for localized PCa.  In 2010, AHRQ funded the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery And Radiation for localized PCa (CEASAR) study. CEASAR consists of a prospective, population-based cohort of 3691 men diagnosed with localized PCa in 2011 who were treated with contemporary therapies, including AS. CEASAR collected baseline patient-reported health-related quality of life, clinical, and sociodemographic data. We then obtained clinical and patient  reported outcomes at 6 and 12 months after enrollment. We also performed medical record review at 1 year, collecting clinical information and data on the technical details of the interventions, complications, short-term cancer recurrence rates, and quality-of-care indicators. We will leverage the existing CEASAR study and collect 3- and 5-year follow-up data to:  (1) Compare the effectiveness and harms of contemporary surgery, radiation and AS in terms of 3- and 5-year patient-reported outcomes and cancer control. We will identify and analyze outcome profiles associated with each therapy that can be used to inform patient specific outcome trajectories when selecting therapy and after treatment. (2) Identify patient-level characteristics  that influence the comparative effectiveness and harms of treatment. We will assess the influence of race, co-morbid conditions and socio-economic status on 3- and 5- year patient-reported outcomes in the entire group and in individual treatment groups to identify subgroups of patients who respond uniquely to certain treatments.  (3) To evaluate the association of quality of care with clinical and patient-reported outcomes. We will assess the relationship between pre-specified quality indicators and 3- and 5-year outcomes in CEASAR. We will then re-assess the comparative effectiveness of the various treatments, controlling for quality measures found to independently influence outcomes.  By understanding what works, in which patients and in whose hands in localized prostate cancer, we will be advancing AHRQ's mission of improving the quality, safety and effectiveness of healthcare in this common condition."
"9047634","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is growing awareness that weakness of muscle is a significant biomedical health issue associated with many different chronic diseases and aging. There are a variety of different diseases that affect muscle, including muscular dystrophy, fibromyalgia, cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis, each of which carries its own unique set of symptoms, accompanied by a myriad of genetic and molecular abnormalities. There is agreement within the basic research and clinical communities that important morphological characteristics of muscle fibers, such as fiber cross sectional area, fiber type, the number and position of myonuclei, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis are among many critical factors that determine the health and functionality of the muscle. Until now, the imaging equipment available is relatively low throughput and the quantification is still largely based on manual or, at best, semi-automatic methods that require extensive human intervention. In Phase I, CytoInformatics LLC has developed a software called CytoQuant, which can accurately perform automatic segmentation and provide accurate boundaries of each muscle fiber for a cropped image patch. The goal of CytoInformatics LLC in Phase II is to 1) deliver the first version of the CytoQuant software to the market, 2) develop the second version of CytoQuant by continuously improving its performance, especially in handling large scale, whole slide images, and also 3) develop an integrated multiplexing imaging hardware and analysis software framework as a seamless solution for high throughput, automated image analysis of muscle specimens. After careful investigation in Phase I (please refer to the details in business plan), we conclude that this integrated software/hardware platform with cutting-edge technologies in advanced imaging, large scale machine learning, and big data is commercially attractive to the entire muscle community including research institutes, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and athletic companies, demonstrated by strong enthusiasm among end users and many supporting letters. The specific aims are: 1) Deliver the first version of CytoQuant developed in Phase I to the market, continue to develop the second version of CytoQuant, which will focus on improving the robustness and speed in handling whole slide images; 2) Develop an integrated platform that provides unified imaging hardware and image analysis software to handle whole slide images labeled with multiple bio-relevant markers. This unified whole-slide based software and hardware solution will deliver an efficient and specialized imaging platform that seamlessly integrates with a high throughput, multi-marker, and automatic image analysis software specifically designed for muscle."
"9256643","7. Project Summary/Abstract My research is rooted in a developmental psychopathology framework and focuses on understanding mechanisms that influence the development and persistence of aggression in youth, with the long-term goal of translating this knowledge to develop more effective prevention and intervention efforts. The prevalence of aggression among clinically referred youth and the well-documented associated risks speaks to the urgent need for research to identify child and familial risk mechanisms to better determine who is most vulnerable and how to best intervene with those youth and their families. The current proposal seeks to examine emotional reactivity as a neurobiological vulnerability for the persistence of reactive aggression (RA) during the critical transition to adolescence, a time period marked by substantial changes in the neurobiology underlying emotional development. Additionally, it aims to assess how dynamic parent-child transactions may serve to exacerbate RA over time, as parenting may be particularly potent for at-risk youth during this developmentally sensitive period. This application details a comprehensive training plan that allows me to address these questions and build on my previous experiences in several important ways. First, in light of the heterogeneity among youth engaging in aggressive behaviors, I aim to examine mechanisms underlying a more specific behavioral phenotype of aggression, namely RA, during the transition to adolescence, a time of rapid neurobiological change. Second, I seek to expand my knowledge of neurobiological assessment modalities to psychophysiological assessment of mechanisms underlying RA. Third, I hope to master the processing and analysis of ecological momentary assessments as an innovative tool to comprehensively assess RA and its underlying mechanisms in daily life. Concordant with NIMH strategic priorities 2.1 and 2.2, the current proposal takes a transactional approach and focuses on within-individual differences by utilizing a multi-modal, ecologically informed assessment of RA, emotional reactivity and parenting during the transition to adolescence. Independent and interactive effects of individual variation in emotional reactivity and parenting dimensions on the development and persistence of RA over 18 months will be tested in a clinically at-risk sample of youth. The aims of the study are 1) investigate concurrent and prospective associations between individual variation in emotional reactivity and RA during the transition to adolescence; 2) examine the bi- directional nature of parental response to emotional reactivity and RA over 18 months; 3) assess parental response to emotional reactivity as a moderator of the association between emotional reactivity and RA. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that heightened emotional reactivity as measured multidimensionally confers risk for the persistence of RA into adolescence, with variation in parental response to emotional reactivity and RA serving to exacerbate or ameliorate this association. This knowledge can ultimately be used to further develop prevention and intervention targets for these specific processes."
"9164685","PROJECT SUMMARY Background. Nearly every hospitalization and death due to asthma could be prevented with appropriate self- management. However, many adults have uncontrolled disease and minorities are disproportionately represented within that population, due in part, to lower rates of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) adherence. Personal beliefs about asthma and its pharmacologic treatment contribute to ICS non-adherence. In our earlier work, we developed and validated a brief self-administered instrument that identified ICS beliefs and asthma self-management practices associated with uncontrolled asthma. When this information was shared, their providers initiated conversations with their patients about these beliefs and practices. However, we do not know if these discussions are effective in engaging patients in self-management decision-making that would foster improved asthma control and quality of life (QoL) via increased ICS adherence. Goal: We propose to adapt and pilot a brief evidence-based patient-informed decision-making intervention with urban minority adults with uncontrolled asthma receiving care in primary care and federally qualified health clinics. Methods: Using community-based participatory research and a Patient Advisor on our study team, we will design and implement a feasibility trial of the Brief Evaluation of Asthma Therapy (BREATHE) as compared to usual care in patients receiving routine asthma care. Using motivational interviewing techniques, PCPs will engage patients to assume greater autonomy for self-management decision-making regarding health and medication beliefs that support asthma control and QoL. Our aims: Aim 1. To evaluate whether the intervention is feasible as measured by recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, and implementation of the novel BREATHE intervention; Aim 2. To evaluate whether the intervention is acceptable to patients and PCPs a multivariable linear mixed model will be used to compare the mean score of the Client Satisfaction Survey-8 across intervention groups. In addition, nested qualitative interviews, post-trial, will provide data on acceptability; Aim 3. Exploration of efficacy. While the study is not powered to provide a definitive test of differences in outcomes between the groups, we will examine differences across groups in asthma control, using the Asthma Control Questionnaire which includes a physiologic measure of lung function, in ICS adherence using the Medication Adherence Scale-Asthma which correlates with objective measures of ICS use and in asthma QoL using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, taking note of the suggested direction and magnitude of the effects for planning a future RCT."

"9177095","Project Summary: Although there are numerous genetic variants associated with age-related degeneration (AMD), a meaningful fraction of missing heritability has yet to be exlained. Many studies have focused on identifying the common variants contributing to this disease in the general population. One aim of this project is to discover rare, highly penetrant genetic variants contributing to familial forms of AMD. The AMD Registry and Biorepository is a large cohort with unique characteristics that include standardized clinical phenotype data and longitudinal prospective data. Some families from this cohort have multiple members with advanced AMD that cannot be explained by known AMD-associated genetic variants and will be sequenced using next-generation sequencing to discover novel variants. Variants found to perfectly segregate with the disease in these families will be assessed for association with AMD in an independent case-control cohort. To discover additional genetic variants contributing to the missing heritability, a second aim is to assess known and novel genetic variants for their role in progression of AMD over time, particularly the effect each variant has on the initiation of the disease and the transition to early, intermediate, and advanced stages. To further the understanding of AMD as a complex trait, quantitative and semi-quantitative intermediate sub-phenotypes will be assessed for association with these genetic variants. Results from this study will fill gaps in our knowledge about the genetics of AMD. We will use these discoveries to develop improved predictive models for AMD progression, and our results may lead to more accurate diagnoses and better therapeutic targets. The ultimate goal is to prevent or slow the progression of AMD and reduce the burden of visual loss due to this disease."
"9199471","Project Summary!  This STTR Phase-II project continues the development of the Newborn Acuity Cardstm and the Newborn Contrast Cardstm. Together, these Newborn Cards form a new clinical test of visual acuity and contrast sensi- tivity for use on newborn full-term and preterm infants. The stimuli are square-wave gratings which the examiner presents to the infant in a fixation-and-following protocol, and determines from the infant's looking behavior whether he/she saw each stimulus or not. An infant's visual acuity or contrast sensitivity is the highest spatial frequency or lowest contrast (the least visible stimulus) he/she can see.  The proposed Phase II work will include a training study in which the best method for training examiners in the use of the cards will be established and documented. The project will also establish age norms by meas- uring visual acuity and contrast sensitivity on a large sample of healthy full-term and preterm infants. Because the test is so new, it is not known how reliable the measurements are. Therefore, this project will include re- peated testing of individual newborn infants, on different days, by different examiners. The Intraclass Correla- tion Coefficient will determine whether measurement of an infant's level of visual function produces results that are more related to the infant's vision rather than to the more ephemeral characteristics of the infant's alertness or the skill of the examiner. The clinical utility of the test (its sensitivity and specificity in detecting vision disor- ders) has not been established, so this project will explore these parameters by testing a sample of infants with and without Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). ROP is not the only serious visual disorder experienced by newborn infants, but it is one of the most prevalent and most serious. This is not a clinical trial, but the results on infants with varying stages of ROP will be a good indicator of whether the Newborn Acuity Cards and Newborn Contrast Cards are sensitive and specific indicators of healthy visual function. The results on the ROP infants will also be used, in conjunction with the age norms, to establish a normal cutoff value for a screening test of only a few cards, which will further increase the convenience of this noninvasive test.  The Newborn Contrast Cards and Newborn Acuity Cards will allow the physician to monitor the vision of patients in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and other pediatric settings, in cases where the visual disorder is progressing (as in Retinopathy of Prematurity or Cortical Vision Impairment) or where the disorder may be treated. Its potential market includes hospitals, neonatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric ophthalmologists around the world. In 71% of cases of childhood blindness in the U.S., the blinding disorder is present in the neonatal period, and the inability to see well may be the only sign of a blinding disorder in half of those cases. Ultimately, we want every newborn infant's vision to be screened, and every premature infant's vision to be tested more thoroughly, and this project will be the next step towards making this plan a reality."
"9299550","ABSTRACT The vagus nerve is regarded as the main parasympathetic conduit of the autonomic nervous system and is involved in the regulation of heart rate, cardiac contractility, ventricular electrical stability and baroreflex sensitivity. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been suggested and/or used as a neuromodulatory therapy for multiple cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. However, given that VNS is an invasive procedure and has been associated with significant adverse events, the mapping of alternative non-invasive pathways for vagal modulation is of critical relevance. Interestingly, the auricular branch of the vagus (ABVN) is the only peripheral branch of this nerve that distributes to the skin. Previous animal studies have demonstrated that ABVN sensory fibers terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and, similar to invasive VNS, ABVN stimulation has also been shown to modulate cardiac electrophysiology resulting in atrial fibrillation suppression, and regulation of left ventricular remodeling. While the anatomy of this nerve has been studied in detail, the functional mapping of the circuitry connecting ABVN stimulation with cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood. Moreover, as NTS activity and the dorsal medullary vagal system operates in tune with respiration, our group has previously suggested that the neuromodulatory effects of ABVN afference can be optimized by gating stimulation to the respiratory cycle. Hence, our overall goal is to functionally map the ABVN-brainstem-cardiovagal outflow pathway in both humans and rodents and assess its sensitivity to the modulatory effects of respiration. In humans, state-of-the-art ultrahigh-field functional MRI (7T fMRI) will afford enhanced spatiotemporal resolution to evaluate the response of the dorsal medullary vagal system and hypothalamus to ABVN stimulation. Neuroimaging will incorporate simultaneous cardiophysiological assessment and dynamic high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) assessment of cardiovagal modulation, using advanced point-process adaptive filtering algorithms developed by our group. More invasive experiments in a rat model will evaluate the effects of ABVN afference on cervical vagus nerve activity (CVNA), while electrocardiography will be recorded to calculate HF-HRV response to ABVN stimulation, thereby directly linking unique rat and human outcomes via a metric common to both. Rat studies will also assess activation in brainstem and hypothalamic homologue nuclei by c-Fos immunohistochemistry in the absence and presence of neuronal activity blocker, and excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter antagonists injected stereotactically into the target nuclei. In summary, the functional mapping of the ABVN pathway in humans is of pivotal importance given its accessibility and its potential neuromodulatory effects on cardiovascular physiology, and our proposal will significantly improve our understanding of the mapping from auricular vagus nerve receptors to the heart."
"9071753","   PROJECT SUMMARY ? TOPS  The overarching goal of the Translational Oncology Program at Stanford (TOPS) is to foster collaboration  across scientific and clinical disciplines in order to gain deeper insights into the underlying causes of cancer  and to develop more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches to cancer. The TOPS  Program was newly created in 2013 to meet the translational goals of the SCI. The program brings together  translational and clinical researchers, chemists, biologists and biostatisticians who have a focus on projects  that will have substantial clinical impact on solid tumors. The program is based on the activities of a number  of working groups including the solid tumor Clinical Research Groups (CRGs) and the Developmental  Therapeutics (Phase I) Working Group. Program members meet monthly to discuss topics of broad general  interest to translational researchers. The new Jill and John Freidenrich Center for Translational Research  (FCTR) provides a venue that brings together interdisciplinary teams of investigators and research staff  whose interests are centered around specific cancer types. The building provides collaborative meeting  spaces and serves as a single convenient location for the disease-specific interdisciplinary research teams.  All TOPS meetings and working groups encourage the participation of graduate students and fellows to  form new interdisciplinary interactions.  Co-led by Mark Pegram, MD and George Sledge, MD, the 42 members of the TOPS Program represent  16 departments and three schools within the University, of whom 13 have been recruited to the Stanford  faculty since the last review. The research activities of the 42 investigators are supported by 27 peer-  reviewed, investigator-initiated grants and include a NCI U10 grant. Peer-reviewed funding consists of  $8.1M in total annual costs of which $4.2M is from the NCI. Other NIH support amounts to $3.0M, and other  peer-reviewed support to $0.9 million. Since 2009, program members have published over 570 manuscripts  of which 12% are intra- and 34% are inter-programmatic. The SCI will continue to be invaluable to the  program by fostering innovative projects and assisting with the translation of research findings into the clinic  for the benefit of cancer patients."
"9270470","Flame retardants in US products are changing rapidly primarily because the most common flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were phased out from 2004 to 2013 because of reported evidence of liver and thyroid effects, developmental changes and neurotoxicity (EPA 2012). Many consumer products which previously used PBDEs now use alternative flame retardants. Occupational exposure to these alternative flame retardants is not currently well characterized. This project will assess exposure to nine alternative flame retardants plus a panel of PBDEs. Exposure will be assessed among workers involved in the manufacture, installation or use of goods containing these nine alternative flame retardants.  These worksite categories will be included in the study: manufacture of products that use flexible polyurethane foams, plastics, or resins, fabrication and manufacture of rigid polystyrene foam, cutting, installing or spraying polyurethane foam insulation at construction sites, gymnasiums, manufacture of wire harnesses or printed circuit boards, and fire service.  Site visits will optimize sampling methods to assess exposure to dominant flame retardants used in each worksite category.  In FY16 a database system was built and refined so that information collected as part of the study can be securely stored and processed.  The site visit report for an air sampling only study was completed and a report on exposures in firefighters was finalized.  Multiple exposure assessments were conducted at nail salons, and sites that use or manufacture isopolyurethane roofing boards and spray polyurethane foam.  Site visit reports are being prepared for the exposure assessments completed in FY16."
"9158403","PROJECT SUMMARY The growing expansion of the approved multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and the variable responses to MS treatment have created an unmet medical need to provide individually tailored therapy. Efforts to bring precision medicine to provide individualized MS treatment selection have been impeded by our limited understanding of the factors that determine treatment response. While genomics hold the promise for closing this knowledge gap, the insufficient number of patients with detailed treatment response data and the modest effect size of genetic variants that influence treatment responses are the main limiting factors in pharmacogenomics studies. As electronic health records (EHR) become widely adopted and increasingly standardized and as we implement sophisticated computational and statistical methods to harness the EHR data, EHR systems can become cost-effective platforms to perform large-scale treatment response studies in real-life settings. Our team with a history of productive collaborations and diverse expertise (led by PI Dr. Xia) previously developed robust algorithms to identify 5,495 MS patients from the Partners HealthCare EHR systems and then model MS disease activity in these patients using EHR data. The Partners EHR system contains longitudinal clinical information on thousands of MS patients from two large academic medical centers and is linked to a well-characterized MS patient research registry and biobanks with existing genomics data. For the proposed study, we will test the hypothesis that meaningful phenotypes of MS disease activity can be extracted from EHR data to inform treatment response, and that additional common genetic variants exist in the population and can predict therapeutic response in MS when combined with clinical features derived from EHR data. The proposed study has three aims with the overall goal to produce a computational and analytic approach capable of identifying MS disease activity in relation to treatment history using EHR data and integrate with genomics profile to develop a predictive model of therapeutic response to commonly prescribed DMTs in this cohort of 5,495 MS patients, including injectable (interferon-?, glatiramer acetate) and oral (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) options. Specifically, we will (1) leverage narrative electronic health records data (e.g., clinical notes, radiology reports) and natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain individualized response to DMTs (n=600 for each DMT); (2) Identify clinical features from electronic health record data (e.g., diagnoses, exposures) that predict response to DMTs using a systematic phenome-wide approach; (3) Develop and test a comprehensive predictive model of individualized response to DMTs that incorporates clinical and genetic predictors. This research has the potential impact to be transformative by contributing to a major knowledge gap regarding the factors that influence treatment response and bringing precision medicine closer to individualized MS treatment selection."
"9272127","ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims."
"9133865","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to establish a CDC Comprehensive Prevention Research Center focused on health- promotion aligned with the disease-prevention objectives of Healthy People 2020. The proposed Health Promotion Research Center at Dartmouth (HPRCD) will leverage the strengths and reach of primary care and community mental health centers in New Hampshire (NH) to conduct dissemination and implementation research on health promotion strategies with a focus on the population health goal of reducing obesity and smoking. Our goal is to measurably decrease cardiovascular risk factors in NH by partnering with primary care, mental health, state agencies, and community partners to identify needs, provide technical assistance, implement, and study evidence-based practices that systematically address two of the CDC's primary Winnable Battles: obesity and smoking. Aim 1 of the HPRCD is to support the implementation and outcome assessment of evidence- based, clinically feasible health promotion interventions for obesity and smoking cessation as an integrated component in primary care settings across NH. We will accomplish this first aim by establishing a Comprehensive CDC Prevention Research Center with six core initiatives: 1) a primary care health promotion implementation workgroup; 2) a mobile health promotion technology workgroup; 3) a health promotion early research career mentoring program; 4) Dartmouth COOP Primary Care Research Network projects; 5) DH Community Health Improvement Plan projects; and 6) collaboration with the regional ReThink Health Initiative. The Center will support and complement these efforts by providing administration and infrastructure support; engaging community partners and providing technical assistance; communicating and disseminating knowledge; providing training in health promotion and implementation research; and evaluation of program outcomes. Aim 2 of the HPRCD is to evaluate long-term weight reduction, smoking cessation, and program sustainability of a statewide demonstration of integrated health promotion in mental health care settings across NH. We will accomplish this second aim by conducting a dissemination and implementation research project that will build on a novel, statewide Centers for Medicare and Medicaid demonstration program implementing integrated health promotion interventions in New Hampshire's Community Mental Health System. The proposed study will evaluate: 1) long-term reduced cardiovascular risk after program completion for 1,500 obese or tobacco dependent adults with mental illness; 2) facilitators of long-term weight loss and smoking cessation: and 3) the long-term sustainability and costs of integrated health promotion programs."
"9224036","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) are the largest consumers of healthcare in the US. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) of clinical effectiveness have not sufficiently studied these patients, while observational studies inherently produce biased estimates of clinical effectiveness. There are substantial disparities in health and healthcare for persons with MCC, particularly those with combinations of diabetes mellitus type II (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effectiveness of statin therapy for preventing heart attacks and strokes remains unknown in populations with MCC. Furthermore, there is insufficient research done on how to best utilize existing data to study MCC in order to obtain answers that can assist these patients and their clinicians in healthcare decision-making. OBJECTIVE AND SPECIFIC AIM: The objective of this study is to help improve the utility of systematic review with meta-analysis as a method for studying the impact of MCC on clinical effectiveness. The specific aim of this project is to test the predictive value of systematic review with meta- analysis as a method for quantifying the impact of MCC on the clinical effectiveness of statin therapy for preventing heart attacks and strokes in patients with CAD, DM and CKD. METHODS: This study proposes to use systematic review with meta-analysis to identify, select and critically appraise relevant research studies, to synthesize the data from these studies in an effort to make recommendations for best practice, and to identify gaps in the literature that can lead to better-informed research for patients with MCC. A systematic review will be done to examine the impact of having MCC on the clinical effectiveness of statins for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. AHRQ guidelines will be implemented to find, assess and synthesize the evidence from all studies, including both experimental and observational designs, which are relevant to the research question. Data from the included studies will be combined statistically to produce several meta-analyses. Meta-regression, subgroup, sensitivity and cumulative analyses will be performed to create quantitative measures of the impact of having different combinations of MCC on the effectiveness of statin therapy. PROJECTED OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of this project will be to determine how well systematic review with meta-analysis can help quantify the impact of having MCC on clinical effectiveness. A secondary outcome will be the quantification of this impact for the effectiveness of statin therapy, which represents one of the most widely prescribed treatments in the US. This study's recommendations will guide researchers on how to utilize systematic review with meta-analysis to analyze existing data on patients with other MCC. This will help reduce the need to conduct additional expensive and large experimental or observational studies, thereby rapidly improving clinical decision-making and speeding up the implementation of evidence into practice for these populations with special care needs."
"9227381","ABSTRACT Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease arising as a result of both genetic background and environmental exposures. Multiple biochemical and developmental programs have been implicated in its pathogenesis. While rare single gene defects can result in T1D, we hypothesize that T1D generally arises through a combination of synergistic defects in two or more key immune ?programs?. Genetic variants associated with T1D can be used as a guide to understand how alterations in these programs individually and in combination contribute to the development and progression of T1D. Although multiple programs are implicated in T1D, in this grant we will focus on four coding variants, PTPN22, TYK2, SH2B3 and IFIH1. Our work and others has established that: the TID PTPN22 risk variant (PTPN22R) alters antigen receptor (AR) signaling, impacting T cell selection, development and survival; the TYK2 protective variant (TYK2P) and SH2B3 risk variant (SH2B3R) alter cytokine responses; and the IFIH1 risk variant (IFIH1R) results in enhanced IFN-1 production. In this DP3, we will address the hypothesis that PTPN22R, TYK2NP, SH2B3R variants individually and in combination contribute to the development of pathogenic islet specific T cells in T1D; and that the impact of these variants is further amplified by an enhanced Interferon response, as seen with IFIH1R, resulting in increased risk for disease development. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine how the altered AR signaling program associated with PTPN22R leads to increased pathogenicity of islet specific effector T cells; Aim 2 will determine how SH2B3R and TYK2P contribute to alterations in the T cell activation and differentiation program in health and disease; and Aim 3 will determine whether PTPN22R synergizes with signaling programs impacted by SH2B3R, TYK2P or IFIH1R to modulate immune tolerance and T1D development. We will apply an integrated approach utilizing: primary human cells, murine models of the human risk variant, and by taking advantage of cutting edge gene editing and proteomics technologies. This approach will allow us to comprehensively interrogate the functional implications of these specific genes and, how the signaling programs that they modulate, function in concert to contribute to TID. Notably, we have found that the altered programs driven by T1D risk variants often mimic those observed in disease, even in patients lacking the specific risk variants we model. Thus, studies of specific genetic risk variants and their functional implications are broadly applicable to understanding the pathogenesis of T1D and will inform the development of new biomarkers and therapeutic agents to treat type 1 diabetes."
"9152028","Project Summary/Abstract In this project we will extend a new method of modeling that makes the simulation of coupled chemical reactions, such as those found in metabolism, much easier to implement and apply. The new approach relies upon mass action dynamics and makes modeling biological phenomena across large scales much easier because (1) time can be rescaled to an appropriate degree and (2) the dynamical equations are `telescopic' ? that is, sets of coupled reactions can be collapsed and just summary reactions modeled with the approach. We will apply this new method to understand the dynamical behavior and circadian rhythms of cells. Circadian rhythms are found in organisms ranging in complexity from cyanobacteria to humans and represent a major aspect of cellular regulation in the majority of eukaryotes. These rhythms control many aspects of cellular behavior, ranging from the release of cellulases in fungi to degrade cellulose in the environment to the dynamics of human cells. Circadian dysfunction in humans underlies metabolic, behavioral, and cognitive disorders. The new approach is based on recent developments in physics, and in statistical thermodynamic fluctuation theories. In these approaches, modeling the relative time- dependence of reactions can be shown to be much easier than modeling the absolute time. We will apply these methods not only to the enzymatic reactions of metabolism, but also to the regulatory network that comprises the circadian clock which controls the metabolism of cells over a period of 24 hours."
"9234669","ABSTRACT Our previous randomized clinical trials evaluated CLOSED LOOP insulin delivery in over 120 subjects under FREE-LIVING UNSUPERVISED HOME settings in studies lasting 1 WEEK to 3 MONTHS (total closed loop operation 81,120 hours/3,380days/9.3 years). All studies used CAMBRIDGE model predictive control algorithm. We demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of closed loop insulin delivery over short to medium long investigations. Given its potential to reduce the BURDEN OF HYPOGLYCAEMIA and diabetes SELF-MANAGEMENT, application of closed-loop insulin delivery is of interest in older subjects due to the increased risk of SEVERE HYPOGLYCAEMIA in this population. The present project addresses the important question of FREE-LIVING UNSUPERVISED HOME USE of closed loop by a system configured to PROTECT against HYPOGLYCEMIA in OLDER PEOPLE with type 1 diabetes, by applying ADVANCED Android-phone closed loop system with pump-integrated HYPOGLYCAEMIA safety feature (predictive low glucose suspend to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in case of Android-phone directed closed loop not being operational). Specifically, in the TEACHNICAL part of the project we will organize FOCUS GROUP meetings with older subjects from participating clinical sites. We will assess what specific closed loop FEATURES are required for this population. The additional feature(s) including personalized TARGET GLUCOSE SETTINGS will be IMPLEMENTED, TESTED and OPTIMIZED on Cambridge in silico population. REGULATORY DOCUMENTATION will be prepared. In the CLINICAL part of the project, we will evaluate the performance of 4 MONTH 24/7 CLOSED LOOP in OLDER SUBJECTS aged 60 years with type 1 diabetes under FREE-LIVING UNSUPERVISED HOME SETTINGS in a RANDOMISED CROSS-OVER design study. We will use closed loop system comprising 640G PUMP and ENLITE 3 sensor (both Medtronic) and an Android phone running CAMBRIDGE MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL ALGORITHM. The system SAFETY will be ENHANCED by the use of predictive low glucose management, INTEGRATED on 640G pump, and suspending insulin delivery when hypoglycemia is predicted even when Android-driven closed loop is not operating. In total, 36 PARTICIPANTS will be randomized to 4 month 24/7 CLOSED LOOP followed by SENSOR AUGMENTED PUMP THERAPY, or vice versa, with a 8-week washout period in between the two interventions. The study will compare BIOMEDICAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL, CARDIAC ARRYTHMIA EVENTS and SLEEP QUALITY of the two study interventions. Time spent within GLUCOSE TARGET RANGE measured by sensor glucose will be the primary endpoint. Biomedical outcomes (HbA1c, mean glucose, time below/above target and other related glucose/insulin metrics) will be complemented by assessments of psychosocial/human factors issues (focus groups and questionnaires), CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA (ambulatory Holter) and SLEEP QUALITY (Actiwatch)."

"9166827","PROJECT SUMMARY Experimental models and human studies have repeatedly linked persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to abnormal fat distribution, body mass index, and glucose and lipid metabolic abnormalities during early life. These are pervasive chemicals to which nearly all children are exposed during early life: PFASs are used in several consumer and industrial applications and PCBs accumulate in food chains. Evidence suggests that these abnormal cardiometabolic trajectories during early childhood may predict insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and even cardiovascular events in adulthood. However, no biomarkers are available to identify in the immediate postnatal period children who are at risk for abnormal cardiometabolic development, thus curbing opportunities for effective, targeted prevention. To address this gap, our long-term goal is to identify novel mechanistic biomarkers in breast milk that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of abnormal cardiometabolic programming and childhood obesity. We will leverage groundbreaking evidence on the roles of breast milk extracellular vesicles (BMEVs) in metabolic programming. BMEVs are small vesicles that are released by luminal epithelial cells in breast milk. BMEVs have been proposed as conveyors of molecular signals from the mother to the child. In particular, BMEVs transport a cargo of microRNAs (miRNAs) that, once ingested by the child, integrate themselves in recipient cells in the child's body and can remotely affect the expression and translation of child's messenger RNAs. This process has been shown to be key to the child's metabolic programming in early life. To date, no studies have been conducted to identify the potential roles of BMEVs as part of the paths linking PFASs and PCBs exposure to its adverse effects on cardiometabolic trajectories and obesity during childhood. To achieve this goal, we will leverage the unique resources of the longitudinal Faroe Islands birth cohort, a prenatal cohort with biobanked breast milk (N=300, all from nursing mothers), extensive exposure data, and repeated postnatal cardiometabolic measures over 13 years of follow up. We hypothesize that BMEV number, BMEV size, and BMEV-encapsulated miRNAs are modified in response to prenatal (third-trimester of pregnancy) exposure to PFASs and PCBs (Aim 1) and that BMEV number, BMEV size, and BMEV- encapsulated miRNA predict cardiometabolic outcomes over 13 years of follow up (Aim 2). We will use advanced statistical modeling to integrate BMEV biomarkers in the paths linking exposure and abnormal cardiometabolic trajectories (Exploratory Aim 3). This study is a high-risk/high-reward and cost-effective project that will provide new noninvasive tools to identify and reduce the burden of abnormal cardiometabolic programming during childhood."
"9145200","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) cause significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric inpatients. Significantly less is known about thes HAIs among children in ambulatory settings, including incidence rates, risk-factors, outcomes and costs. Pediatric ambulatory central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and surgical site infections (SSI) following ambulatory surgery, likely harm thousands of children annually, although precise epidemiologic data are unknown. Single-center studies and disease-specific studies led by this proposal's principal investigator, suggest the burden of ambulatory pediatric HAIs may be 3 times higher than inpatient pediatric HAIs. In addition, existing ambulatory HAI studies often utilize labor intensive surveillance and data collection methods, making ongoing identification of HAIs challenging and interventions to reduce these infections difficult to scale and disseminate. This grant proposes a multisite, epidemiologic investigation into 3 pediatric ambulatory HAIs using the New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN). The NYC- CDRN is a comprehensive and longitudinal healthcare data repository from 5 pediatric healthcare systems in a diverse region. This proposal directly responds to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Funding Opportunity Announcement HS-15-002 on ambulatory patient safety, focuses on an urban population, and will benefit an AHRQ priority population: children. Utilizing both clinical and administrative electronic data, and intensive chart review methodologies, we will identify incidence rates, risk factors, patient outcomes and costs for ambulatory pediatric CLABSI and CAUTI, and SSI following ambulatory surgery. Additionally, we will develop and validate Classification and Regression Tree (CART) predictive models for HAI events and central line and urinary catheter days based only on clinical and administrative electronic data. This research will draw attention to pediatric ambulatory patient safety, reduce the ambulatory HAI surveillance and data collection burden and serve as the foundation for future projects aimed at reductions of ambulatory pediatric HAIs across multiple institutions."
"9079478","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will continue the efforts that NIA has financed in earlier waves in order to maintain and improve the comparability of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) with its sister surveys, especially the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). It will add measures into SHARE which are already contained in those surveys and implement HRS-style training and survey management in SHARE. The project is part of a broader agenda to support research on individual and population aging which combines three elements, namely (1) international comparisons based on cross-nationally harmonized data, (2) measurement of health as objective as possible in large-scale social surveys, and (3) life-course data from early childhood onwards, in order to better understand the effects of health care, economic and social policy on health and other outcomes at older ages. The essential argument for cross-national analysis is that the variety of circumstances and policies is in general much larger across countries than within a single country. Researchers can learn from what has happened and what has been tried elsewhere. More fundamentally, the impact of health, economic and social policies can only be understood if we observe one policy in contrast to other policies. Comparability of measures across studies is essential for such cross-national research. Comparability is achieved by measuring the same concepts in all sister surveys and by using survey methods that achieve comparable outcomes. This proposal addresses both dimensions by filling strategic gaps in the SHARE survey content and by harmonizing central aspects of the survey methodology. The emphasis on objective measures of health and physical activity as important outcome measures is based on the desire to minimize the inter-personal and inter-cultural variation in interpreting questions and response categories in a social survey. This project therefore stresses the harmonization of physical performance tests, employing grip strength, chair stand, peak expiratory flow, and accelerometry, and a large array of harmonized cognitive performance tests. The emphasis on early childhood and other life-course variables follows from the insight of recent research that cross-national differences in health care delivery systems, economic and social policies manifest their effects starting very early in life and then accumulate in positive and negative feedback cycles over the entire life course before they determine later-life health, economic and social outcomes. The proposed project will fit in the long-run agenda of the SHARE panel which will administer a life- history module in Wave 7 and a cognition module in Wave 8. Funding is restricted to the marginal costs of those additional data collection efforts that are needed to bring the regular SHARE data closer in line with its sister surveys, especially HRS."
"9306451","Project Summary/Abstract  The Institute for Child Health Policy at the University of Florida (UF-ICHP) currently measures and evaluates  quality of care for almost 1 in 5 children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program  (CHIP) in the US. We collaborate with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the Florida  Agency for Health Care Administration, the Florida Healthy Kids Program which oversees CHIP, two Texas  Medicaid Managed Care Plans and their health system partners, two dental plans, the OneFlorida Clinical  Data Research Network, and two External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) partners. These  collaborators joined to form the Child Health Quality (CHeQ) Partnership. We also are partnering with  PEDSnet, a national network of children's hospitals and providers, who will participate in validation for  measure refinements that incorporate electronic health record (EHR) data. Through our collaboration  experiences, we identified implementation and dissemination opportunities for the following measure sets: 1)  Linkage Between Dental Treatment and Dental Prevention and 2) Safe and Judicious Antipsychotic Use in  Children and Adolescents. UF-ICHP has a16-year history in both states in measuring children's quality of  care (QOC) and evaluating performance improvement projects. We house fully identified Medicaid and CHIP  health care data for all enrolled children from 2007 to the present that are refreshed monthly. Further, we  house EHR data in a central repository called the OneFlorida Data Trust for 1.2M or 49% of all children in  Florida Medicaid and CHIP, which will be used to enhance the Antipsychotic Use Measure set with metabolic  screening and monitoring lab results. We are leveraging our substantial infrastructure and experience to  conduct the proposed project and address the required goals as specified in RFA-HS-16-002. The two goals  of this project are to test the feasibility and usability of the selected measure sets through: 1) field testing;  refining; collecting data, including testing the efficient collection of valuable clinical data from EHRs; and  reporting on the measures; and 2) translating the results into QI goals and multi-level performance  improvement projects. In addition, we will implement and disseminate leading-edge methods to evaluate and  compare quality of care at multiple levels, including the state, health plan, and provider levels. A toolkit,  based on lessons learned, that provides practical guidance on how best to design and analyze quality of care  data at multiple levels and how to make valid comparisons within and across levels will be developed."
"9127727","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9180131","Abstract: The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing BubR1 protein abundance and function, and its role in the regulation of tumorigenesis and aging. Aging is the single greatest risk factor for cancer development, yet the mechanistic basis driving this interrelationship remains largely undefined. BubR1, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to ensure faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis, and therefore is intimately linked to genomic integrity and cancer. Interestingly, recent studies have implicated BubR1 in the aging process where BubR1 abundance has been shown to decline in a variety of tissues as mammals age. Mice engineered to express low levels of BubR1 from birth die within a year, exhibiting increased senescence, premature aging phenotypes and an increased susceptibility to cancer, whereas mice overexpressing BubR1 have an extended lifespan with reduction in age- related diseases and cancer development. Senescence is believed to be largely tumor-suppressive and prevent cancer in young individuals. However, in aged individuals senescent cells can contribute to age-related cancer development. Therefore, BubR1 may play a pivotal role in the interrelationship between aging and cancer given that BubR1 suppresses both senescence and tumorigenesis. Previously, we identified an acetylation-dependent mechanism regulating BubR1 protein stability, where SIRT2 prevents degradation of BubR1 through deacetylation, leading to lifespan extension of a BubR1 premature aging mouse model. Furthermore, BubR1 protein levels in aged animals can be restored to youthful levels by stimulating SIRT2 activity through induction of NAD+ levels. These results suggest that the age-related decline in BubR1 levels can be reversed, potentially alleviating age-related diseases including cancer. Therefore, we hypothesize that BubR1 is a key tumor suppressor, and its loss with age increases cancer susceptibility. In this proposal, we plan to: 1) elucidate the physiological role of BubR1 post translational modifications during aging and calorie restriction and their impact on mitotic progression and tumorigenesis; and 2) determine the mechanisms regulating BubR1 protein abundance and function during aging. These studies will elucidate how regulation of BubR1 by post-translational modifications controls mitotic progression and tumorigenesis during aging as well as to identify mechanisms through which BubR1 declines with age and controls the aging processes. Given that aging poses the largest single risk factor for developing cancer, elucidating the molecular details governing the physiological role of BubR1 in cancer and aging will provide mechanistic understanding of the interrelationship between aging and cancer development, as well as identify possible therapeutic strategies to treat age-related diseases."
"9191177","Project Summary/Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by progressive loss of lung function and is the third leading cause of death in the US. Treatments that target the mechanisms underlying COPD pathogenesis do not currently exist and present a logical avenue for new therapeutic development. Our group and others have established that tobacco smoke, the leading cause of COPD, alters the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and that this ?acquired CFTR dysfunction? is also present in COPD. Genetic mutation of this ion channel is responsible for the etiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) which, like COPD, is characterized by progressive reduction in lung function due to defective mucus clearance. The FDA has identified several harmful toxicants in tobacco smoke, among which are reactive aldehydes such as acrolein, which we have shown in preliminary data are detrimental to both CFTR function and mucus clearance. Through the proposed studies, we will elucidate how specific chemicals within tobacco smoke alter CFTR function and mucus clearance in COPD. We hypothesize that acrolein and other aldehydes are principal components of tobacco smoke that inhibit CFTR function and contribute to defective mucus clearance, and that aldehyde scavengers can ameliorate these effects. To test this, we have developed three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize how whole cigarette smoke affects CFTR-dependent ion transport and mucus clearance. In Aim 2, we will establish whether reactive aldehydes such as acrolein can recapitulate the effects of whole cigarette smoke in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3, we will determine whether acrolein blockade using reactive aldehyde scavengers can protect against smoke-induced CFTR dysfunction and subsequent impairment of mucus clearance. These studies will advance the field by revealing the mechanistic basis underlying how tobacco smoke contributes to COPD manifestations, potentially leading to new targets and an innovative treatment approach."
"9072013","SUMMARY  This proposal is designed to test our novel hypothesis that cellular stress-mediated acid ceramidase (AC)  activation, invoked by radiation or chemotherapy, leads to resistance to apoptosis by induction of S1P-S1PR2-  mediated AKT activation, leading to nuclear PTEN export. As a corollary, we also hypothesize that targeting  AC inhibits S1P/AKT signaling, overcoming cell death resistance in the treatment of prostate cancer. We plan  to dissect mechanisms of resistance at the molecular and pharmacological level to develop novel treatment  strategies as follows: Specific Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms of AC-dependent resistance to cell death  following therapy stress. Specific Aim 2. Determine the therapeutic roles of targeting the AC/SK1/S1P/AKT axis  to overcome therapy resistance for the treatment of prostate cancer. Data obtained from these studies will  provide novel mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance by targeting AC and/or SK/S1P  signaling in solid tumors, including prostate, kidney/bladder and/or liver tumors, which are within the focus of  this Program Project."

"9352910","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defining the regulatory networks altered in the disease can provide not only the insights on the mechanisms underlying disease, but also the possible therapeutic targets. Several factors such as genetic variation and methylation sites can disrupt the interaction between transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory regions (e.g. promoters and enhancers) and thus alter the regulatory networks. However, to identify the altered networks in disease is still challenging. First, to identify the genetic variation and methylation sites that play a role in gene regulation, we will need to map the genetic variation and methylation sites on the regulatory regions that is specific to the pathological tissues. While DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) and histone mark profiles are powerful to determine the regulatory regions, it is not feasible for every laboratory to be equipped to measure DHS and histone mark on the tissues of interest. Therefore, we need a computational algorithm that is accurate enough to differentiate the regulatory regions between diseased and normal samples. Second, although a large number of differentially methylated sites have been determined for different disease, their functional role remains largely unclear. DNA methylation has been generally considered as a potent epigenetic modification that prohibits TF recruitment, resulting in transcription suppression. Recent studies and our own preliminary results showed that some TFs preferentially bind to methylated DNA, an interaction that in some cases activates gene transcription. Therefore, we need to identify such TFs and incorporate these methylation- dependent TF-DNA interactions in the computational platform. Third, we need a unified computational framework to incorporate various and these diverse types of factors that could alter the regulatory networks. To address these challenges, we will develop a computational framework to incorporate the effects of genetic and epigenetic variations and identify the regulatory networks altered by these effects. In this framework, we will develop a computational approach to predict regulatory regions in tissue of interest by integrating various epigenetic datasets (Aim 1). Our approach is analogous to homology modeling for protein structure prediction, fully utilizing the existing epigenetic datasets from ENCODE project. We will then develop a model to provide quantitative measurement of interaction strength between TFs and DNA with consideration of genetic variation, DNA methylation and TF concentration (Aim 2). This model will incorporate our new discovery that some TFs preferentially bind to methylated DNA motifs. Our computational framework will then be applied to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of vision loss in Americans aged 60 and older. The altered regulatory networks in AMD will then be experimentally evaluated (Aim 3). Finally, we will make our software and the regulatory networks in AMD available through an interactive, user-friendly database (Aim 4)."
"9340495","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespan is a complex trait, influenced by many interacting polymorphic alleles and environmental factors that may accelerate or delay aging, reduce or increase disease risk and/or promote extended lifespan. Thus, assessing the role of genetic variation in aging requires an experimental strategy capable of modeling the genetic and biological complexity of human populations while allowing for efficient identification and validation of candidate genes. With this proposal, the JAX NSC seeks support to further develop and disseminate the next generation of genetic, statistical and information resources necessary to enable a systems-wide approach to understanding healthy aging. The JAX NSC has transformed aging research at JAX, providing central resources to support our investigators that have resulted in 38 peer-reviewed publications and several active grants in the last funding period. The Center has developed nascent regional and national resources for aging research, including genetic maps, novel statistical methods and aging mouse resources and tissues that support our numerous collaborations and external researchers. All JAX NSC data are publicly disseminated on the Mouse Phenome Database and the JAX NSC website, thus ensuring that the resources generated and expertise acquired through the Center are readily available to the aging research community. In this renewal, we will advance toward our goal by providing next-generation resources and support to aging investigators while leveraging JAX's unparalleled expertise in the large-scale identification and functional validation of complex polygenic traits i mice. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Increase the diversity of mouse resources available for aging research, including a new large-scale intervention study to investigate gene-diet interactions in genetically diverse mouse populations; 2) Strengthen statistical tools and support available to the aging community; 3) Expand the use of genetic approaches to translational research in aging, namely through a robust screening pipeline for candidate human aging genes; 4) Expand the research focus on aging, healthspan and age-related diseases at JAX through a robust Research Development Core; and 5) Provide effective Center administration and enhance the utility of JAX NSC resources throughout the aging community. The Center will be led by a highly experienced team of Principal Investigators and Core Leaders who, together with JAX NSC members and with oversight from an External Advisory Board, will provide effective management to facilitate the goals and objectives of the Center. The Center will also leverage the unparalleled institutional resources, facilities and expertise of The Jackson Laboratory, a globally renowned institution for mouse genetics research, to enhance its goals and the utility of the resources it generates for the aging research community."
"9085102","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulty recognizing speech in noise presents a great challenge to an older listener's ability to participate in social activities and obtain medicl care, often resulting in social isolation, cognitive decline, and psychological disturbance. Voice pitch, as defined by fundamental frequency (F0) in speech, is one of the most powerful cues for speech intelligibility in the presence of noise. While data from younger normal-hearing listeners suggest dynamic pitch cue is helpful for speech recognition in noise, some older listeners may be deprived of benefit from this cue because they cannot perceive it. Aim 1 of this proposal is to determine whether older listeners' individual ability to perceive dynamic pitch contributes to speech recognition in noise. We will use a pitch contour identification test to quantify dynamic pitch perception, while having a pitch discrimination test to control for ability to perceive stati pitch. The amount of difficulty understanding speech in noise will be measured by subjective and objective tests. Data will be acquired from both presbycusic and older near-normal hearing listeners to demonstrate a wide range of variability associated with hearing loss and aging. It is anticipated that the outcome of the Aim 1 experiments will serve as a foundation for devising customized clinical approaches that involve dynamic pitch perception as a potential contributor to speech-in-noise deficit.  The efficacy of pitch contour for enhancing speech recognition also depends on the noise scenario and listener characteristics. Aim 2 of the proposal is to elucidate the environmental and listener factors modulating the efficacy of dynamic pitch cue for enhancing speech recognition in older adults with variability in age and hearing status. The benefit of dynamic pitch cue is defined by the differences in speech recognition performance across three target speech conditions (normal contour, flat contour, and strong contour). The amounts of benefit will be compared between modulated versus static noises, as well as between speech versus non-speech noises. It is predicted to be higher in modulated noise than in static noise, and to be higher in speech masker than in non-speech masker. Age and hearing loss are expected to influence the amount of benefit from dynamic pitch. The outcome of the Aim 2 experiments can direct development of technology and rehabilitation program that enhance the efficacy of dynamic pitch cue in these important noise situations."
"9355275","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and type II diabetes (T2D) have been increasing globally at epidemic proportions. Epidemiological studies indicate that air pollution is an environmental risk factor for development of insulin resistance (IR) and T2D. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution exposure causes progressive IR leading to T2D remain unclear. There is increasing evidence that IR, which often precedes the T2D by decades, may be modulated through epigenetic changes. Gestation and early childhood are periods of enhanced vulnerability to air pollution and also coincide with the stage at which epigenetic patterning is first established. We have previously established in mouse models that concentrated ambient pollution (CAP) exposure for >12 weeks potentiates the development of obesity, IR and T2D, and also induces a range of abnormalities that are prototypical for IR and T2D, including changes in immune function in systemic tissues (hypothalamus, circulation and adipose), reduced brown adipose tissue function, hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress/steatosis and prototypical defects in insulin signaling in insulin response tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle and adipose. We have further demonstrated that early age is a period of vulnerability, as exposure to CAP during this period accelerates development of IR with overt changes in glycemic control developing in <10 weeks. Further, these defects are secondary to critical alterations in reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways and inflammation in insulin responsive tissues. CAP exposure also results in genome-wide increases in in 5-mC. Hypothesis: Air pollution exposure results in global epigenetic alterations that result in metaboli re-programming in target tissues leading to obesity and insulin resistance. We posit that epigenetic programming during vulnerable periods of development (e.g. in utero or early childhood) is particularly prone to irreversible changes in the epigenome and the persistence of IR. This project will leverage access to state-of- the-art ambient exposure facilities, investigatie expertise in exposure science, disease pathways and epigenetics available at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University to accomplish these specific aims. SA1: To characterize the epigenomic changes in response to air pollution that may either precede or overlap with the development of an insulin resistant phenotype. SA2: To define the IR and global epigenomic changes associated with early life CAP exposures. SA3: To determine whether cessation of air pollution exposure reverses insulin resistance and corresponding epigenomic changes. SA4: To integrate the epigenomic and transcriptomic perturbations that track with the development of the IR phenotype. These animal model studies with our well optimized controlled air pollution exposure that cause metabolic syndrome will reveal comprehensive epigenomic marks that precede the phenotype and are conserved between the target and surrogate tissues. The data will provide new leads for validation of mechanisms as well insight into interpretation of human studies."
"9193750","Currently, over 25 million U.S. citizens have diabetes, including 20% of veterans in the VA system. With diabetes prevalence predicted to rise 35% by 2025, diabetic complications impose an ever-increasing burden on healthcare systems. One of the most common complications, diabetic retinopathy, is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults. In addition, early neuronal dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy occurs prior to clinically diagnosable pathology and is likely intimately related to other diabetic complications, for example, cognitive and motor deficits and microvascular changes in the brain. The continued increase in diabetic patient numbers and the complexity of their care underscores the urgent need to identify the earliest possible window for treatment. Our approach is to identify an earlier time point for intervention and develop clinically translatable treatments to target diabetic complications prior to obvious signs and symptoms. In this study, we will be using the Goto-Kakizaki rat model of Type II diabetes because approximately 90% of diabetic patients in the VA system are Type II. We hypothesize that: 1) early retinal deficits in diabetes will correlate with cerebral deficits and later stage retinal deficits, and 2) identifying the time course of early retinal deficits will allow us to introduce interventions prior to clinically relevant symptoms of diabetic retinopathy as well as cognitive and motor deficits. In the first specific aim, we will identify the temporal appearance of retinal dysfunction, using electroretinography to assess retinal function and optical coherence tomography to assess retinal structure, and test whether these defects correlate with cognitive dysfunction (y ?maze), motor dysfunction (rotarod), and later stage vascular pathology (acellular capillaries and pericyte loss). After determining the time course of these deficits, in the second specific aim, we will identify whether dopamine deficiency is a common mechanism underlying diabetic injury in the brain and retina. We will assess levels of dopamine and DOPAC (HPLC). After we have identified the temporal appearance of dopamine loss, we will implement L-DOPA treatment to reduce dopamine deficiency in diabetic rats. We will determine whether rats receiving treatment exhibit reduced dopamine deficiency and reduced retinal, cognitive, and motor dysfunction. In our third specific aim, we will determine whether exercise reduces dopamine deficiency and prevents the progression of visual and cerebral dysfunction in diabetes. The expected outcome of this study is that treating at the earliest signs of retinopathy in a rodent model of Type II diabetes will provide protection against diabetic damage in the brain and retina. This research can lead to the identification of a similar window for preclinical retinopathy treatment in diabetic patients, which would allow for greater treatment efficacy and prevention of future complications. If exercise and/or treatments that target dopamine protect against retinal and cerebral complications in diabetes, these findings would motivate the development of a human clinical trial. Overall, the motivation for this study is the need for a better understanding of early diabetic retinopathy with the long-term goal of developing treatments that delay or prevent vision loss and other complications in our Veterans and others with diabetes. The Atlanta VA has a large population of diabetic patients and is currently conducting research on the effects of exercise treatment on cognition and Parkinson's disease in VA patients, making this research project an excellent fit for the Center's goals and interests. This research will also provide valuable training to the postdoctoral candidate, which will enable her to become a successful and productive independent investigator in the field of diabetic retinopathy within the VA research environment."
"9335067","ABSTRACT We propose to characterize associations among the fecal microbiome, the fecal glycome, and measures of household environmental exposures in infants who do and do not subsequently develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from the MARBLES cohort. One of the most common co-morbidities in autism are gastrointestinal problems, and the presence of frequent symptoms of diarrhea or constipation is associated with more severe symptoms. However, virtually all research on GI dysfunction in ASD to date has been conducted after the ASD diagnosis has been made, thus not allowing for examination of temporal relationships between GI dysbiosis and the onset of ASD. Moreover, few underlying biologic mechanisms have been identified. Increasingly, the prominent but insufficiently characterized, role of the microbiota in human health has been recognized. Environmental influences on individual gut microbiota profiles are also coming under scrutiny, but there has been very little work on the impact of chemical exposures on the microbiome. Taking advantage of data and samples available from a large, prospective pregnancy study of high-risk infant siblings of children with autism, this project seeks to investigate the development in early postnatal life of the individual profiles of the gut microbiome, the environmental chemical influences on these, and their relationship to GI symptoms and to the subsequent development of autism and its early signs. Our overarching hypothesis is that environmental exposures common in developing countries influence the developing intestinal microbiota and intestinal permeability in the first year of life and that the resultant dysbiosis and gut ?leakiness? increase risk for development of ASD. With an established interdisciplinary team at the cutting edge of the microbiome and glycome measurement, we will use recently developed effective techniques to quantify fecal milk glycans and milk glycan monomers that are clear drivers for intestinal health or dysbiosis in the developing infant gut microbiome. We will apply an innovative mechanistic framework that incorporates a number of known or suspected factors in GI dysfunction in ASD, including a compromised intestinal barrier, and links exposure to environmental toxins, GI outcomes, and ASD. Establishing associations between the maternal and child environment, the developing infant gut microbiome, and onset of ASD symptomology and diagnosis would set the stage for mechanistic studies examining ways to shift the infant microbiota away from onset of dysbiosis during the first year of life?a critical developmental period?with potential implications for neurodevelopmental outcomes."
"9242936","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Technological advances in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) allow for treatments to be implemented and continued for days, weeks, or even months depending on an infant's gestation and underlying condition. During this time, the infant may experience pain and other symptoms that are difficult for healthcare providers to assess and manage, and also for parents to comprehend, which may cause them emotional distress. Currently there is a significant gap in our understanding of the symptom experience of critically ill infants at high risk of dying in the NICU compared to other pediatric and adult populations. Closing these knowledge gaps is critical to improving evidence-based care for these infants and their families. The long-term goal is to improve the symptom assessment and thereby the care that critically ill infants and families receive in the NICU. The objective of this prospective, longitudinal study is to characterize infant symptom burden among 100 infants in the NICU from multiple sources and identify associations between parents' perceptions of the infant's symptom experience and their decision-making, coping, and distress. The central hypothesis is that proper assessment and management of infant symptoms and suffering will enhance parent decision-making, as well as reduce infant suffering and parent distress. The rationale is that identifying symptoms that are most distressing for infants, parents, and clinicians will inform the design and evaluation of future interventions to improve care. The study objective will be obtained by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) to prospectively characterize the symptom experience of critically ill infants at high risk of dying in the NICU from multiple sources (i.e. parents, nurses, medical chart review, and behavioral observation) from admission until discharge/death (or a maximum of 3 months); 2) to identify links between parents' perceptions of infant symptom burden, suffering, and quality of life and the effects on treatment decision-making and goals of care over time; and 3) to identify links between parents' perceptions of infant symptom burden, suffering, and quality of life and parent coping and distress over time. This approach is innovative because it is the first prospective study, to evaluate the symptom experience of critically ill infants in the NICU and to explore how perceptions of their experience impact parent decision- making, coping, and distress. This research is significant because it will inform the design of novel prospective investigations and intervention development aimed at improving symptom assessment and outcomes among infants and their families in the NICU."
"9092881","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bones and cartilages of the jaws, face, neck, and inner ear develop from migratory precursors called neural crest cells (NCCs). In the ventral portion of the embryonic head, NCCs populate structures called the pharyngeal arches. The pharyngeal arches control multiple aspects of NCC development, including their migration, patterning, and differentiation. Consistent with this, mutations in genes involved in pharyngeal arch formation underlie the craniofacial defects of DiGeorge (Tbx1) and Bamforth-Lazarus (Foxe1) syndromes. Similar skeletal abnormalities have been linked to in utero disruption of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, an essential regulator of pharyngeal arch formation. Understanding the complex genetic and molecular interactions underlying pharyngeal arch development is the first step toward identifying the causes of, and treatments for, genetic and environmentally-induced disruptions of head skeleton development.  Morphologically, pharyngeal arch development begins with out-pocketings of endoderm called the pharyngeal pouches. The lateral outgrowth of the pouches, and their fusion with overlying ectoderm, partitions the walls of  the pharynx, creating the pharyngeal arches. A few of the genes driving pharyngeal pouch initiation and outgrowth have been identified, including the transcription factors Tbx1/10 and Pax1/9. These factors are coexpressed with several other transcriptional regulators and signaling molecules in the pharyngeal endoderm. The evolutionarily conserved expression and function of these genes suggest they are part of a gene regulatory network (GRN) for pouch formation. However, the precise regulatory relationships between these putative pouch GRN components and how their segmental expression is first established in the pharyngeal endoderm, is unknown. The proposed work will address these gaps in our knowledge using an innovative comparative approach incorporating the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and the frog Xenopus laevis. The sea lamprey is the most basal vertebrate amenable to developmental manipulations. Due to its slow development, morphologically simple pharyngeal apparatus, and large number of similar pharyngeal pouches, the sea lamprey is particularly well-suited to studying the dynamic, iterated genetic interacts driving pouch formation. Furthermore, technical advances have made genetic manipulations in this species routine. Comparisons of gene expression and function between lamprey and X. laevis, a tetrapod vertebrate, will highlight the core, conserved aspects of the pharyngeal pouch GRN likely operating in all vertebrates, including humans. The specific aims of the work are to address these 4 questions: 1) what are the positions of Six1, Eya, and Foxq1 in the pharyngeal pouch GRN?; 2) do segmental Wnt11r and FGF8 signals from adjacent tissues activate expression of pouch GRN components in the pharyngeal endoderm?; 3) does a RA signaling gradient form a differentiation `wavefront' that regulates iterated activation of pouch GRN components? and 4) does a `clock' of oscillating gene expression establish segmental expression of pouch GRN components?"
"9187756","PROJECT SUMMARY The steady growth of products containing engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) has outpaced research to determine their impact on biological systems, most importantly human health. Our goal in this Nanomaterials Health Implications Research (NHIR) Consortium proposal is to elucidate how physicochemical properties of ENMs and their molecular interactions affect the immune and hormonal status of exposed animals. We will accomplish this goal by collaborating with NIEHS project scientists and NHIR Consortium members to test ENMs provided by the ENM Resource and Coordination Core (ERCC) first in vitro using a novel air-liquid interface system, and then in vivo for a subset of ENMs using a Pulmonary Tox Protocol and a Developmental Tox Protocol. Each protocol will employ nose-only and whole-body inhalation exposure and a host of outcome measures to assess body condition, cytotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress, gene expression, immune modulation, endocrine disruption, and histopathology. We will share our data and methods within the NHIR Consortium and beyond, thereby contributing to the development of comprehensive biological response profiles of selected ENMs and identifying those that pose significant hazards for vulnerable populations including pregnant women and children. Three specific aims will be addressed: AIM 1: Identify which ERCC- characterized ENMs are most likely to induce cytotoxicity, inflammation, or immunomodulation in airway epithelial cells using our established in vitro air-liquid interface model system. AIM2: Characterize comprehensive biological responses to selected ENMs following subchronic inhalation exposure in pregnant compared to non-pregnant mice. AIM 3: Elucidate biological response profiles in male and female offspring following exposure to ENMs in utero and then postnatally by inhalation and lactation. These aims will be accomplished by an experienced research team with expertise in inhalation toxicology of nanomaterials, developmental toxicology, nanoaerosol generation and characterization, and ENM proteomics. Five primary hypotheses will be tested: H1) Inhalation of the ENM under study induces significant biological responses at the selected dose compared with controls. H2) ENM exposure produces adverse effects with a distinct biological response profile that is dependent on pregnancy status. H3) Maternal ENM inhalation exposure from pre-conception to delivery produces adverse developmental responses in fetuses. H4) Pups with further post- natal exposure develop toxicological responses not seen in sham-exposed controls or in ENM-exposed adults. H5) Following in utero and post-natal ENM exposure, maturation without exposure is associated with disease progression. The research proposed herein will significantly advance understanding of the dose-specific toxicity of inhaled ENMs and the operative AOPs and thus, will establish a framework for improving the safety profile of commercial ENMs and guide their safe and sustainable use."

"9108611","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental aspect of our existence is the fact that we move through space. We do not do so randomly; rather, we use a variety of different strategies to reach our navigational goals efficiently. One such strategy is landmark-based navigation (LBN), which is the use of stable landmarks to determine one's location and orientation relative to the enduring spatial structure of the world. The current application describes a competing renewal of a research program in which we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and cognitive behavioral testing to understand the neural systems that underlie LBN. Under the theoretical scheme we have developed, LBN involves three cognitive mechanisms: a landmark recognition mechanism, a localization/orientation mechanism, and a route planning mechanism. During the initial funding period, we used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data to demonstrate that the parahippocampal place area (PPA) supports landmark recognition and the retrosplenial complex (RSC) supports localization/orientation. These results indicate that the neural network involved in LBN can be fractionated into functional subsystems tied to the three cognitive mechanisms. Our goals in the next funding period are to use these discoveries as a springboard to understand the mechanistic operation of the LBN system and to extend the investigation to encompass route planning. Aim 1 is to delineate the information processing functions of the landmark recognition mechanism in the PPA and to identify its functional inputs. Aim 2 is to understand the how the RSC uses external features and egocentric experience to mediate localization/orientation. Aim 3 is to identify and characterize the neural mechanisms that support route planning in RSC and the medial temporal lobe (MTL). If successful, this research will result in a detailed theory of the neural basis of landmark-based navigation. This knowledge will have important health implications in two domains. First, understanding the mechanisms that underlie LBN is critical for the development of rehabilitation strategies and navigational aids for  the blind. Second, because the brain regions investigated are often impacted early in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, the knowledge gained about these systems will be useful for diagnosing and managing these diseases."
"9358454","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With their introduction into practice over the last two decades, electronic medical records (EMRs) have become increasingly recognized as platforms to not only improve delivery of care to the individual but also to understand variability in domain such as disease presentation and outcomes or quality assurance. Coupling dense genomic information to EMRs in eMERGE has provided tools for both discovery and initial implementation in genomic medicine, while raising new challenges and opportunities for using genomic data in healthcare. These include developing and mining the large datasets necessary to identify groups of patients with extreme phenotypes or rare genotypes; identifying clinically-relevant subsets of common diseases; and identifying actionable genomic variants and determining how best to deploy these in a learning healthcare system. Building on our experience and contributions to eMERGE-I and eMERGE-II, we propose here three specific aims to address these challenges. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand the network's phenotyping library by creating increasingly granular phenotype definitions that identify specific subsets of disease with predictable clinical courses or response to therapies. Genotype-phenotype relations will be studied by GWAS and advanced PheWAS methodology we have developed. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify rare variants with strong associations with human traits by resequencing 100 genes in 2,500 subjects at our center as part of the eMERGE-III 25,000 patient cohort. We propose studying genes with variants known to affect human health and drug responses, and variants that our preliminary PheWAS analysis implicates as robust markers of important human phenotypes. In Specific Aim 3, we will expand PREDICT, our pre-emptive pharmacogenomic implementation program, to develop a pipeline that will deliver actionable variants to patients and providers and to assess their response. We will collaborate across eMERGE to develop, implement, and assess tools to deliver new information, measuring impact to ensure optimal benefit to patients. By executing these discovery and implementation aims, our site and the eMERGE network will contribute importantly to advancing the vision of Genomic Medicine as a contributor to modern healthcare."
"9176661","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While air quality has improved over the past decades, air pollution is ubiquitous and the absolute number of people affected is a major public health concern. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified outdoor air pollution and particulate matter (PM) as carcinogenic to humans and a cause of lung cancer. This recent classification calls for prompt action to address the gaps in the epidemiologic literature on the role of air pollution in increasing the risks for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), two of the top four causes of death in the United States. Thus, we designed the following aims, leveraging the rich environmental, lifestyle, neighborhood, molecular, and surveillance data of the long- standing Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study. We propose in Aim 1 to quantify and characterize the associations between estimated exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and lung cancer risk among 112,023 California (CA) MEC participants with 3,057 lung cancer cases. In Aim 2 we will quantify and characterize the associations between PM2.5, PM10, and risk of COPD among 46,000 CA MEC participants with Medicare data, including 11,508 COPD cases. In Aim 3 we will investigate the relationships between PM2.5, PM10, and serum levels of the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, already available in 7,566 CA MEC participants. In each of these aims, we will also assess the extent to which these PM-associations are modified by co-pollutants (e.g., NO2 and NOx traffic markers), individual-level (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, smoking status), and neighborhood-level (e.g., socioeconomic status, ethnic enclave) factors. The strengths of this proposal include: (1) it represents one of the first prospective air pollution and lung cancer and COPD study to include sizeable numbers of Africans and Latinos (n=80,489); (2) it addresses the complexity of air pollution assessment by evaluating three separate measures of estimated air pollutants having different advantages and functionalities; (3) it leverages multiple measures of exposures over the same periods to provide a greater depth in understanding exposure patterns and associations with risk; and (4) it incorporates a molecular epidemiology component. Through this work, we expect to increase our understanding of the burdens of lung cancer and COPD associated with air pollution exposure and to identify differences in associations among important subgroups."
"9191760","Project Summary  The skin, the largest and most external organ in the body, is routinely subject to inflammatory insults. As such the skin, specifically the epidermis, is tasked with maintaining a physical barrier in the face of pathogenic and toxic insults. Importantly, cutaneous epithelia are replenished by a small pool of epidermal stem cells (EpdSCs) capable of self-renewing and differentiating into the various lineages of the tissue in healthy and disease states. Yet, to date, the lasting impact of inflammation on these precious tissue stem cells has not been examined. My preliminary data indicate that EpdSCs can sense and respond to inflammatory signals, and sustain epithelial hyperproliferation. Intriguingly, I find that inflammation-experienced epidermis is faster at full thickness wound closure than age-matched control skin indicating that inflammation causes long-term changes to tissue fitness and function. Based on these early findings, I hypothesize that EpdSCs are likely altered as a result of inflammation. Using a well-defined murine model of T cell mediated skin inflammation, I aim to systematically dissect specifically how EpdSCs are altered by inflammation and elucidate the consequences of such alterations on tissue fitness. To this end, I will 1) characterize the long-lasting transcriptional and epigenetic changes within EpdSCs and changes to the skin milieu, post-inflammation, 2) assess differences in tissue fitness and function within the post-inflamed epidermis, and lastly, 3) test the functional significance of identified genes and pathways for their contribution to the sustained differences within the inflammation-experienced epidermis. I propose using cell type/stage-specific CreER+; Rosa26YFPfl/fl mice to lineage trace and FACS purify the progenitor and differentiating populations of the epidermis as well as inflammation-experienced epidermal cells. To dissect intrinsic changes within the EpdSCs post-inflammation, I will perform ATAC-Seq in conjunction with transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq). Genes of interest will be those with sustained differential expression after inflammation and which are candidates for direct targets of the transcription factors activated in EpdSCs after inflammation. To determine their functional significance, I will knock them down in vivo using shRNA and an established in utero lentiviral injection system and test their consequences to the rapid immune response. Because EpdSCs are long-lived cells, they represent ideal targets for efficacious long-term interventions. Additionally, because these adult epidermal stem cells are central to the development of cancers, chronic wounds and epidermal aging, as well as disorders associated with accumulating inflammatory stresses, understanding how an epidermal stem cell is impacted by inflammation will provide novel mechanistic insights into the etiology and pathology of these epithelial diseases."

"9243105","Abstract More than a decade after the seminal IOM report, ?To Err is Human?, failure rates in patient safety remain stubbornly high in hospitals. Prior efforts to improve hospital quality have had relatively little impact, in part due to limited access to timely quality improvement data. Our long-term goal is to leverage existing technologies to give voice to hospitalized patients and their family members, leading to improvements in hospital safety and quality. The overall objective in this application is to create and evaluate a tool that gathers patient and family member feedback and makes it rapidly available to providers, enabling nimble and responsive safety and quality improvement efforts. The central hypothesis, based on the theory of co-production, is that observations from patients and families, gathered in a structured way, will provide actionable information regarding patient safety and quality. The rationale for doing this project is to test an innovative new approach to creating a rapidly available data stream to providers who are working on specific improvement efforts, and a mechanism for creating a quality improvement approach that is inherently patient-centered. We plan to test our central hypothesis and thereby accomplish the objective of this application by focusing on the following areas of research for Health IT: Use, Implementation, and Impact on Outcomes, under the study type ?Pilot and feasibility?, pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1. Determine feasibility and acceptability of the patient data collection and provider dashboard tool (Use and Implementation). We will conduct usability testing prior to study start, measure user (patients and providers) engagement over time, and gather feedback about the tool at study end. We hypothesize that patient and caregiver characteristics will predict tool use. Aim 2. Assess whether reporting patient- and caregiver- observed processes of care to providers leads to changes over time (Implementation). We hypothesize that performance on structured items of interest will improve over time with rapidly available data presented to providers. Aim 3. Estimate tool implementation effect sizes, using a pre- post design, on medical errors (Impact on outcomes). The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, based on a paradigm-shifting conceptual model of patient-engaged quality improvement, and because it leverages technology to gather and present data in an unprecedented manner. The expected contribution of the proposed research will be an adapted tool that will gather meaningful and important data on patient safety and present it in an actionable way to providers and hospital leaders, resulting in a powerful data stream to fuel rapid improvements in patient safety. Pilot data from this proposal will inform the design of a future cluster- randomized trial of the new tool across multiple hospital systems. This contribution will be significant because it represents key steps towards a new approach to improving patient safety in the hospital."
"9318658","The primary goal of the project is to improve lower the mortality rate in future outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) by improving the quality of care delivered by health care workers in the field. We will do this by analyzing current care procedures, determining what can be effectively automated and/or performed by a robot system, and then implementing, testing, and evaluating this automation. The communities most impacted by the work in this proposal will be those suffering from EVD during the next outbreak where some of the technology developed .here is deployed. A secondary community is the health care providers, such as Medecins Sans Frontieres, with whom we will collaborate on this work. The secondary goal of this project is to develop a methodology and approach for introducing robotics and automation into public health care settings, with a focus on improving overall patient outcomes. Although this specific work in this proposal addresses EVD, much of what we learn will be applicable to a wide variety of public health care settings. The specific aims of this proposal are:  Aim 1: Build mathematical models of MSF procedures for the care of patients with Ebola  Aim 2: Identify high-value tasks and subtasks most suitable for automation  Aim 3: Automate selected tasks and sub-tasks, and compare overall system performance RELEVANCE (See instructions): NIBIB: Integrates engineering with the life sciences to improve the treatment of disease, and includes studies to assess the effectiveness of new processes incorporating robotic devices. NICDH: Improve effectiveness of rehabilitation treatments for people with disabilities by reducing mundane workload burden on health care providers through automation, allowing them to focus on patients. NINOS: Improve stroke rehabilitation through automated reminders and compliance-checking, and also free up health care providers from mundane tasks, to spend more time with patients."

"9108149","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Global health organizations highlight engaging men and boys in preventing violence against women as a potentially impactful public health strategy. A gender transformative approach involves altering gender and sexuality norms that foster violence against women while promoting bystander intervention (i.e., giving boys skills to interrupt abusive behaviors they witness among peers) to reduce the perpetration of sexual violence (SV) and adolescent relationship abuse (ARA). This study will test, via a two arm cluster randomized controlled trial, a gender transformative SV/ARA perpetration prevention program titled Boys Care implemented in a community-based setting among African American adolescent males ages 14-17. This is a stakeholder- engaged intervention that involves an 18 hour curriculum divided into 3 weekend day sessions delivered over a 2 month period (at 4 week intervals) in community-based youth-serving agencies (YMCA and Urban League). Control sites will implement an evidence-based life skills curriculum. The rationale for focusing on primarily African American youth in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods is two-fold. First, racial/ethnic disparities in health are stark in Pittsburgh, the setting for this study; prevention efforts in communities with high prevalence of poverty, sexual violence, and poor health outcomes are needed. Second, the prevention educators are from these communities and have high degrees of trust and respect fundamental to building positive youth relationships. Innovations are: first, an intersectional approach combining gender theory, adolescent sexual development, and community-partnered research to evaluate the impact of gender transformative programming on SV/ARA perpetration in socially disadvantaged communities; second, a program that integrates education and skills building around gender norms change with sexuality education theorized to target SV perpetration and increase healthy sexual behaviors; third, a stakeholder-engaged approach in design and implementation to ensure local relevance, feasibility, and replicability; and fourth, use of arts-based strategies to encourage youth to explore masculinities. Via a 2-arm cluster-randomized trial in youth-serving agencies (10 clusters, N=960 adolescent males ages 14-17), this study will assess the effectiveness of Boys Care compared to a life skills curriculum. At the end of the 2 month program (Time 2), compared to controls, youth will demonstrate increased positive bystander intervention behaviors (secondary outcome). Intermediate outcomes are: increased condom and contraceptive self-efficacy; increased recognition of abusive behaviors; increased gender-equitable attitudes; and increased intentions to intervene with peers. Six months after the intervention (Time 3), youth will report less perpetration of SV and ARA toward females (Primary Outcome) compared to controls. This study will provide urgently needed information about the effectiveness of a gender transformative program that combines healthy sexuality skills, gender norms change, and bystander skills to interrupt peers' disrespectful and harmful behaviors to reduce SV/ARA perpetration among adolescent males."
"9111668","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury leaves 17,000 children disabled yearly. Many children do not achieve their expected developmental trajectory after injury. Services exist for children with specific developmental disorders when they are known to be at risk for delays; however, children with traumatic brain injury frequently do not access these services. The overall goal of this project is to understand how traumatic brain injury affects children's development. This project is a longitudinal, prospective cohort study of children 0 to 15 years of age with all severities of traumatic brain injury. Children with traumatic brain injury and a comparison group of age and sex- matched children with orthopedic injury will be recruited from the two participating institutions. Specifically, the aims of this project are to fist characterize this cohort of children and age and sex matched orthopedic injury comparison children in relation to acute, post-acute and longer term treatments. We will characterize the children's family environment and cognitive and socio-emotional reserve as these may influence changes in children's short and longer term health status. Then, we will measure health specific outcomes during the first year after injury, including physical health, post-concussion symptoms, and stress. We will assess children's longer term developmental progress using growth curve analysis of key neuropsychological domains including cognition, social, and psychological health outcomes compared to children with orthopedic injuries. We will then use structural equation modeling to examine the relationships of injury severity, family environment, and neuropsychological status on children's ability to participate in everyday activities and perform i school. Finally, we will quantify children's health service use and health care costs for the year following injury. Results of this research will help to understand the complex interactions of preinjury family and child characteristics, post injury child deficits and family stress on childre's developmental outcomes. This information will be integrated with the children's current health service and school support service use in order to understand the barriers to services and inform the needed supports for children at each developmental stage."
"8998397","Project Summary  The Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) has a well-established internal, Institutional, and external Planning and  Evaluation (P&E) process that engages leaders, members, and advisors from multiple disciplines, perspectives  and levels. The goal of this process is to guide future directions, set priorities and prioritize investments of the  Center while, at the same time, providing ongoing mechanisms to monitor, assess and adjust research  progress, Programs, Shared Resources, allocations, and strategies. This cohesive process is supported by  highly integrated and effective bodies, such as the Senior Leaders, Executive Committee, Program Leaders,  Shared Resource Advisory Committees, and the External Scientific Advisory Board (ESAB), which provides  critical advice and feedback from experts. The Planning and Evaluation process has resulted in changes in  Program focus, development of new Cores, changes in clinical research operations, and prioritization of  Developmental Funds. Complementing these efforts are Programmatic, Divisional and Center-wide research  seminars, meetings and retreats that foster new interactions and collaborations with Penn colleagues and  external experts. Strategic planning is embedded in the ACC and Penn culture. The ACC plan of 2008-2013  set forth the goals for this period, including accelerating the translation of basic science discoveries into  investigator-initiated clinical trials, establishing a comprehensive molecular profiling and personalized medicine  initiative, enhancing behavioral interventions to reduce cancer risk, and promoting translation of ACC research.  Soon after his appointment, the Center Director, Dr. Dang, defined his vision through 2020, and charged a  group to recommend strategies to realize the Center's goals in translational research and precision medicine.  A defining accomplishment has been $20M from the Institution to establish innovative transdisciplinary  programmatic efforts in translational cancer research, which are fueled by multi-year Institutional grants and  resources in high priority areas. Rigorous internal review of Programs, Shared Resources, Developmental  Funds, and strategic plan reviews by the ESAB ensure that the ACC continues to strive for excellence and  adheres to NCI guidelines. The ACC responds to all ESAB recommendations and then reports on its actions.  Taken together, the integrated P&E processes have successfully guided the growth and development of the  ACC during the project period."
"8998415","Project Summary  The Cancer Therapeutics Program has been continuously approved by the NCI CCSG since 1993. The  Program seeks to improve patient outcomes through the rapid development of novel research ideas which are  translatable to the clinical arena and ideally can be individualized to disease and patient-specific settings. The  Programmatic goals are as follows: 1) Bring forward novel preclinical breakthroughs from the bench to the  bedside and bring relevant cancer therapeutics from the clinic to the lab in order to enhance the mechanistic  understanding of cancer therapeutics; 2) Take new drugs from first-in-human Phase I trials to disease-specific  clinical trials that will have a significant impact on establishing new standards of care; and 3) Develop  pharmacodynamic and predictive markers to select the best drugs for the patients most likely to respond.  These goals are applied across four research themes: targeted therapies, combinations to overcome  resistance, immunotherapy, and predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. This Program, which was rated  as ?Excellent? at the time of the prior CCSG renewal application, is led by Program Co-Leaders Drs. Ravi  Amaravadi and Naomi Haas, who were jointly appointed in September 2013. They succeed Drs. Peter  O'Dwyer and Corey Langer, who were asked to become leaders of new cross-Programmatic translational  research Initiatives in pancreatic and lung cancer, respectively. The new Co-Leaders were chosen because  they have complementary skill sets that match the future directions of the Program. Dr. Amaravadi has  expertise in the preclinical-to-translational space, and Dr. Haas has expertise in taking Phase I studies into  disease-specific studies and developing multi-institution clinical trials. Drs. Amaravadi and Haas are NCI-  funded researchers who bring their scientific vision, innovativeness and energy to this Program, which includes  an emphasis on basic and translational research. The 25 Program members represent 10 departments in the  Perelman School of Medicine. During the current project period, translational research has continued to be a  major focus. Members currently have $6.7M in annual research grant funding (direct costs), of which $3.6M is  peer-reviewed and $2.4M is NCI-funded. There have been a total of 361 cancer-related publications authored  by Program members during the project period. Of these, 12% are intra-Programmatic, 39% are inter-  Programmatic and 57% are multi-institutional."
"9349634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic focal skeletal disorder that affects 2-3% of the population over 55 years of age with genetic heterogeneity. PDB is characterized by high bone turnover with increased abnormal osteoclast (OCL) formation/bone resorption activity followed exaggerated osteoblasts response at focal lesions. Pagetic OCL contains paramyxoviral nuclear inclusions and nucleocapsid transcripts. We have previously shown that measles virus nucleocapsid protein (MVNP) induces pagetic phenotype in OCL. Also, we identified high levels of RANK ligand (RANKL), a critical osteoclastogenic factor expression in bone marrow stromal/preosteoblast cells from patients with PDB. However, the mechanisms of elevated RANKL and OCL activity in PDB are unclear. In preliminary studies, microarray analysis revealed that MVNP significantly increased expression of CXCL5 (72 fold) in normal human bone marrow monocytes. Bone marrow monocytes in paget's patients also demonstrated high levels of CXCL5 mRNA expression and increased serum levels of CXCL5 compared to normal subjects. CXCL5 stimulation significantly increased RANKL expression in normal human bone marrow stromal/preosteoblasts. We further show that CXCL5 increased the levels of p-ERK1/2, p-p38 and p-CREB which modulate RANKL expression in these cells. Interestingly, anti-CXCL5 antibody suppresses MVNP induced pagetic osteoclast differentiation. We hypothesize that MVNP induction of CXCL5 controls RANKL expression and contribute to enhanced osteoclast development/bone resorption activity in PDB. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the specific aims: (1) Determine the potential of MVNP induced CXCL5 to stimulate RANKL expression in stromal/preosteoblasts and pagetic osteoclast development. (2) Delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying CXCL5 modulation of RANKL expression in stromal/preosteoblast cells and pagetic OCL development. (3) Determine the contribution of CXCL5 in RANKL expression and pagetic osteoclast (OCL) development using MVNP transgenic mice in vivo. The long-term goal is to identify small molecular therapeutic compounds targeting CXCL5/CXCR1 axis to control high bone turnover in PDB."

Individuals with SMI die 25 years earlier, on average, than the general population and are designated a health disparity population by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. While the Internet provides exciting opportunities to support person-centered health care, web-based resources may convey new barriers and, consequently, contribute to even greater health disparities for individuals with SMI. For those with limited access to computers, mobile devices may provide promising opportunities to enhance Internet access, if resources are appropriately designed and accessible. Specific Aims include: (1) Employ user experience design to make strategic recommendations for eMH redesign including the eMH4me training module and the eMH Bridges component prototypes. We will conduct structured, systematic reviews by experts and users of existing eHealth information resources (n < 20) including the current eMH resource; two focus groups of users with SMI (n < 20) to ensure the selection of appropriate content, level of complexity, and technology; and a review of eMH web analytics data from the previous 12 months. Design recommendations will comprise the eMH Strategic Plan to inform next project phases. (2) Conduct in-person usability testing to develop the fully functional eMH4me and eMH Bridges prototypes. We will conduct iterative, side-by-side sessions with individuals with SMI in the laboratory or office environment (n = 20). Appropriate modifications will be made, based on testing, to finalize the prototypes. (3) Conduct remote testing of the acceptability and feasibilit of the eMH4me and eMH Bridges prototypes with individuals with SMI (n = 100) with access to the resources for two months, to assess satisfaction, usefulness, and ease of use and learning. We will obtain feedback via telephone interviews with a purposive subsample of these users (n = 20); and evaluate usage metrics. Findings will inform refinements to eMH4me and eMH Bridges. Final products will also include the eMH Satisfaction Survey and Quality Metrics Profile for ongoing use. eMental Health will be actively sustained by long-standing partners, and will be an essential resource to individuals, organizations and institutions across the country committed to improving health outcomes for individuals with SMI."

"9071748","PROJECT SUMMARY ? PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM  Overview  The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS), referred to at Stanford as the Scientific Review  Committee (SRC), has been operational at Stanford University since 2005. Each year we have reviewed  our operations and implemented improvements in order to ensure that studies conducted at the Stanford  Cancer Institute (SCI) are of the highest scientific merit, feasible to conduct and employ resources  appropriately.  SCI's SRC is charged with providing peer review of all institutional and national clinical research protocols  involving cancer patients at Stanford. The patient and other populations from which SCI studies are drawn  include those in the Stanford Clinical Cancer Center, Stanford Health Care at large including outreach sites,  Stanford Children's Health and the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. Scientific review applies to all  phases of clinical therapeutic intervention, behavioral clinical trials, tissue and body fluid research, and  diagnostic trials that impact medical decision making for the treatment of cancer patients. Particular  attention is paid to reviewing investigator-initiated clinical trials, and especially those for which there is no  other peer-review mechanism. The primary focus of scientific review is on the scientific merit of the study.  However, the SRC is also responsible for ensuring that studies conform to the research objectives and  priorities of SCI.  Scientific review is performed in addition to the review of ethical issues carried out by Stanford's  Administrative Panels on Human Subjects in Medical Research, also called Institutional Review Boards  (IRBs). Both the SRC and the IRB must approve any study prior to subject enrollment.  SCI ensures that its clinical research studies are of true scientific merit, high quality, have access to an  adequate patient population and meet requisite statistical benchmarks. To accomplish these objectives, the  SRC is charged with providing scientific peer review of all research protocols involving cancer patients  treated at SCI.  The SRC also has the authority to review and approve or deny all trials involving subjects with cancer. The  SRC is also responsible for annual reviews of studies and has the authority to suspend or close studies due  to low accrual, stopping rule violations, change in scientific relevance or other scientifically-based reason."
"9200115","Project Summary Notch1 is a cell surface protein that has diverse roles in human biology at all stages of life. Notch1 is modified by a number of sugar structures, including a number that are termed O-fucose. Alteration of the pattern of O- fucose structures found on Notch1 has significant effects on Notch1 function, which in turn has been linked to both developmental and adult pathologies, including cancer. To date the study of O-fucose structures on Notch1 has been severely hindered by a lack of research reagents that can specifically detect and monitor this structure. Currently, mass spectrometry is the method of choice for the analysis of O-fucose glycans on Notch1. Although an extremely powerful technique, it requires specialized instrumentation and expertise not available in most laboratories. Development of sensitive and specific antibodies for O-fucose glycans on Notch1 will provide many investigators with the tools to analyze O-fucose glycans in vivo, including clinical specimens. We will utilize a newly-developed methodology that enables reliable production of antibodies that can recognize distinct protein epitopes in the context of specific glycan modifications to produce antibodies to O- fucose on Notch1. If successful these O-fucose-Notch1-specific antibodies will facilitate research on Notch1 in many laboratories and possibly could lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic tools."
"9271388","Project Summary/Abstract:  Small vessel cerebrovascular disease is a major risk factor in Alzheimer?s disease. However, quantitative biomarkers that are suitable for use as endpoints in clinical trials for these conditions are still lacking. The goals of the present project are to 1) in the UH2 phase, evaluate and identify MRI-based microvascular biomarkers that are diagnostic and predictive, with a particular focus on a novel marker referred to as cerebrovascular reactivity; 2) in the UH3 phase, work with the Coordinating Center and other projects in the consortium to further evaluate the most promising biomarker candidates in a multi-site setting.  Conventional anatomic imaging (e.g. T2-FLAIR) can identify white matter hyperintensities that represent the consequence of small vessel damage. In this project, we will emphasize several newer techniques that probe the potential physiological driving force of small vessel cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Specifically, we will focus on a marker indexing the dynamic coupling capacity of the neurovascular unit, referred to here as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). Our previously studies on CVR have revealed that: 1) CVR is three times as sensitive to age as resting perfusion. 2) CVR is diminished in patients with AD dementia. 3) Decline in processing speed (over four years) is significantly associated with CVR decline (over four years). 4) CVR of the brain is strongly correlated with structural lesions as seen on T2-FLAIR. Therefore, the present project will emphasize the development of CVR MRI as a small vessel imaging biomarker, with additional consideration of several other microvascular parameters including microbleeds count and cerebral blood flow (CBF). These small vessel measures (vascular imaging markers) will be combined into a composite index based on their contributions to cognitive impairment, which will form a composite imaging biomarker for diagnosis, prediction, and target engagement of VCID.  Our Specific Aims in the UH2 phase are: 1) Examine the association between cognitive function and candidate vascular imaging markers in a group of elderly individuals with mixed vascular and Alzheimer?s pathology; 2) Conduct technical assessment of the vascular imaging methods to show that they are multi-site ready in terms of applicability and reproducibility; 3) Work with Coordinating Center and other Development Projects to establish the consortium in preparation for the UH3 phase. Quantifiable milestones have been defined for these aims and for the readiness of the project to enter the UH3 phase, in which the specific aim is to perform collaborative studies as part of the small vessel biomarker consortium to further evaluate and develop the most promising biomarker candidates.  Impact: Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed a small vessel imaging biomarker that is ready for large scale multi-site clinical validation studies."
"9135946","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While existing teen pregnancy prevention efforts have contributed to significant declines in the overall U.S. teen pregnancy rate, teen pregnancy prevention programs specifically targeting adolescent males are limited and sorely needed. The primary aim of the proposed research is to further develop, evaluate, and disseminate a teen pregnancy prevention program specifically designed for adolescent males to enhance the current scientific evidence and intervention options available for broad public health scale up. Specifically, the intervention entitled, Fathers Raising Responsible Men (FRRM) is designed to facilitate important paternal parenting behaviors that influence adolescent decision-making. The proposed research focuses on the adolescent male component of teen pregnancy by identifying and addressing adolescent risk and paternal protective behaviors specific to adolescent males that have not been fully addressed in previous prevention efforts. FRRM incorporates a novel, theoretically-based intervention highlighting the important and influential role that fathers have on the development of adolescent males. This study strives to reduce adolescent male sexual risk behavior through targeting Black and Latino adolescent males aged 15-19 and their fathers residing in the South Bronx in three phases. Phase I is a pilot study consisting of 50 families to test and refine the intervention and technical and training assistance needs. Phase II is the RCT comprised of 800 families to rigorously evaluate the intervention. Finally, Phase III will conduct an implementation science study incorporating successful RCT participants in order to refine any intervention and training materials to increase the scalability and dissemination of FRRM and the study results. These three phases allow for the successful implementation and evaluation of FRRM in conjunction with the refinement and provision of all training and technical assistance necessary for the intervention. If successful, the proposed project will further develop  the current scientific evidence and intervention options targeted specifically to the teen pregnancy prevention needs of ethnic minority adolescent males."

Dyslexia, a prevalent learning disorder specific to reading, is currently only reliably identified after demonstrated failure with learning to read, which can negatively impact socio-emotional well being and academic achievement. Early identification of children at risk for dyslexia offers the potential to lessen the negative consequences of difficulty learning to read, however, current methods utilized are not sufficient to effectively identify children at risk early on. Therefore, evaluating the mechanisms that underlie literacy development offers the potential to optimize approaches to early identification. As learning to read is a complex, multi-faceted process that relies on several speech and language-related sub-skills, one approach is to investigate how these sub-skills contribute to literacy development. To date, one sub-skill that remains understudied is the role of speech production accuracy in contributing to subsequent literacy skills, despite evidence that some children with disordered speech production, known as speech delay, develop reading difficulties. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether speech delay and reading difficulties stem from shared or distinct underlying bases. Therefore, studying brain morphology at an early age may uncover the underlying mechanisms associated with speech delay versus early risk for dyslexia, and discern the neural mechanisms that lead to reading difficulties. To further investigate the mechanisms that underlie subsequent reading difficulties, the proposed research will take a multidimensional approach to investigate the behavioral and neural links between speech accuracy, pre- literacy skills, and subsequent literacy skills. The proposed research will build upon an ongoing longitudinal investigation of 186 children with/without behavioral risk for dyslexia (as indicated by pre-literacy skills) from kindergarten through second grade (NIH?NICHD R01 HD067312), and retrospectively identify children with/without speech delay through percent consonant correct (PCC) analysis of speech recordings. The proposed research will be the first to investigate brain morphology in kindergarteners with/without speech delay relative to those with/without risk for dyslexia, which will delineate the structural correlates of speech delay while accounting for early risk for dyslexia. The longitudinal aspect of this research will further investigate the relationship between early speech accuracy, early behavioral risk for dyslexia, and subsequent literacy skills through mediation and moderation analyses. In addition, the proposed research will examine to what extent behavioral and neural indicators of early speech accuracy and pre-literacy skills may explain subsequent literacy skills. Overall, the proposed research seeks to uncover the underlying mechanisms that give rise to literacy skills, and optimize prediction of subsequent literacy skills early on. This research may offer significant implications for jointly evaluating speech production accuracy and risk factors of dyslexia in early identification.  "
"9327837","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure and congenital heart defects threaten the lives of several thousand children each year. The only FDA-approved long term pediatric heart support device is the Berlin Heart Excor, which is based on 30+ year old technology and is fraught with complications including blood clots forming in the device requiring frequent device replacement. The recipients of this technology are at high risk for strokes, bleeding, and infection and the pumps are driven by a large 220 lb. console, which limits patient mobility and prevents hospital discharge. In spite of these severe limitations, 90% of Excor recipients survive to transplant, although the median duration of support is only 35 days. A safer device would dramatically reduce the complications of support, permit discharge to home, and allow doctors to deploy the technology earlier, before a child reaches the brink of death. VADovations is developing a miniature implantable pump platform, the Revolution, in which minor modifications of 2 components can be implemented to adjust the pump performance to support the right or left side of the heart. The devices are 8 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length, about the size of a 'AAA' battery, compared to the market leading Heartmate II, which is 47 mm in maximum diameter and 95 mm in length, the size of a 'D' cell battery. Our adult Revolution RVAD can safely generate the lower blood rates needed for a pediatric left heart assist device and has demonstrated exceptionally low blood trauma in bench-top studies and during implants in sheep for durations up to one month with no long-term blood thinners. Building upon these promising results, we propose a Fast Track, combined Phase I/II SBIR to re-purpose the Revolution RVAD as a pediatric left heart assist device, the Revolution MINI, for children ages 1 and up. Then we will revise the design to create the Revolution NEO for neonates and infants, aged 0-1, who represent the largest clinical need for pediatric heart support. During Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the MINI for pediatric blood flow rates and pressures during in vitro and short term animal experiments. In Phase II, we will conduct chronic animal implants to evaluate the long-term function, biocompatibility, and durability of the pumps and perform verification and validation studies of the Revolution MINI system to prepare for a US clinical trial. Throughout the program, we will focus considerable efforts on anatomic fit modeling and studies to devise approaches so that these devices can be implanted in the smaller bodies of children, to avoid pumps protruding from the body, as occurs with the paracorporeal Excor. Superior hemocompatibility, smaller size, and the ability to leverage adult system components, combine to produce pediatric heart assist devices that will offer fewer complications, permit patient discharge to home, and be economically viable to revolutionize the treatment of pediatric heart failure."
"9331239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  SARCOIDOSIS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING LLC is a medical diagnostics company developing a diagnostic blood test for sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that affects ~10-40 per 100,000 people per year in the U.S. and disproportionately affects African-Americans and women. Sarcoidosis can lead to advanced pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, sudden cardiac death and devastating neurologic disease. Thus, sarcoidosis represents a significant health problem and health disparity concern. Because sarcoidosis can affect any or multiple organs, sarcoidosis must be differentiated from many other inflammatory, infectious or immunologic diseases and cancer. A consensus in the medical community is that there is no useful blood test or other easy way to diagnose sarcoidosis; a diagnosis requires biopsy confirmation, often by lung or lymph node biopsy, with its attendant risks and costs. The costs involved with diagnosing sarcoidosis have not been published, but estimates could exceed $225 million each year. The need for a safer, cost-effective diagnostic blood test for sarcoidosis is clear. This Phase I application proposes to continue the development of a promising diagnostic blood test for sarcoidosis initially developed with funding from a Centers for Advanced Diagnostics and Experimental Therapeutics in Lung Diseases Stage I (CADET I) award to Johns Hopkins University. This diagnostic blood test is based on the discovery of a specific microbial protein, mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase (mKatG) that stimulates the immune system in most patients with sarcoidosis. This test uses mKatG and other microbial proteins to stimulate release of the inflammatory chemical interferon-? from blood cells to predict sarcoidosis. To date, our proposed blood test has a sensitivity of 65%, a specificity of 96% and a positive predictive value of 94%. With these promising results, we propose to further develop this test by optimizing test characteristics for different subgroups with sarcoidosis and to establish the reliability and operating range of laboratory procedures for this test. In this Phase I proposal, we will also develop a commercial prototype diagnostic kit to test the feasibility of deploying the test in different geographic centers. Finally, we will establish a marketing approval process with the FDA and complete a framework for a prospective multicenter study to validate this test as part of a Phase II application. If successfully validated in Phase II studies, the test could have a transformative impact on how clinicians diagnose sarcoidosis given the absence of an alternative safe and cost-effective test. Such a test would have a high potential for commercial application and with widespread use could result in considerable cost savings to the U.S. healthcare system."
"9353951","Developing sensitive and valid indicators of dementia and cognitive function in low literacy and low income countries is challenging and requires creative approaches to complement standard neuropsychological batteries. In this proposal, we aim to incorporate an innovative approach to assessing cognition and to validate it against standard cognitive batteries,medical and informant assessments in 3 of the HRS sister countries: South Africa (HAALSI), United States (HRS/COG), and Ireland (TILDA). South Africa has a low literacy rate in older people, varying degrees of use of written language and different cultural cues compared to Western industrialized countries. In order to assess cognition in this setting, we assess cognitive function leveraging non-verbal and minimally numeric assessments for a range of cognitive domains. Through administration via tablets, responses are recorded and scored immediately with less reliance on interviewer training than most other cognitive assessments. The tablet-based assessments will be validated in relation to the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) developed by HRS for this proposal across HAALSI, TILDA and HRS/COG (Aim 1). Clinical and informant interviews are added to develop a dementia risk score (Aim 2). We conduct the validations and harmonization in age and education stratified samples of 300 men and women 50 -79 years old in each of the three cohorts (n=900). These novel ?next generation? instruments are just being developed and we now need information regarding their validity compared to standard cognitive assessments. Developing cross-walks between these measures and other commonly used indices is of special importance in the set of sister studies related to the Health and Retirement Study where the explicit goals are to permit comparisons across countries, especially with regard to dementia. TILDA and HAALSI offer specific advantages in calibration because they have had rich additional neuropsychological and health data from earlier waves across an educationally diverse older population. We have two aims in our proposal: Aim 1. To assess the validity of the Oxford based language controlled cognitive measures in relation to the HCAP measures using identical platforms for HRS/COG, TILDA and HAALSI 1.a. to evaluate content, criterion and construct validity of Oxford assessments againts HCAP 1.b. to develop a refined battery of items based on the 1.c. to develop a harmonized set of items that have good psychometric properties Aim 2. To develop a common dementia risk score in each country based on the additional information gathered from proxy/informants and a clinical evaluation. This risk score will be harmonized and validated."

For the past twenty years, ECRI Institute has built a reputation for organizing annual conferences which have been addressed and influenced issues of critical concern in healthcare and to AHRQ in particular. ECRI Institute convenes these conferences each year because the organization is dedicated to disseminating evidence-based information to the public. With our conferences, we stress that we must be able to assess the status of the evidence and not just pose questions that are philosophically interesting. In 2014, we are examining how  complex  (aka  high risk ) patients and increasingly complex healthcare delivery systems interact. The 2014 conference will address care coordination and transitions, and care  in and out  of the hospital and will introduce the themes that will be addressed in the 2015 and 2016 conferences. In 2015, in partnership with the National Cancer Institute and others, our conference will be examining patient-centered cancer care. And in 2016, the conference will be focused on the use, misuse, and abuse of prescription drugs. The main objective of these conferences is to serve as the  impetus  for important conversations and to stimulate significant research. Past conference topics have included data big and small, patient- centeredness, comparative effectiveness, personalized medicine, and  systemness.  We have long-standing collaborations with public and private organizations that join us in addressing our conference themes. The U.S. Department of Veterans, the University of Pennsylvania Health System, and Kaiser Permanente have agreed to play lead roles in these conferences. These conferences, as like those in past years, will have an in-person audience that we estimate will be 500. ECRI Institute receives no commercial sponsorship for its conferences. These conferences are free and open to all. All speakers contribute their time and are not paid honoraria. They are paid travel associated expenses. The themes of these conferences and their emphasis on examining the evidence make them of great value and importance to the current healthcare climate and to AHRQ and its on-going initiatives."
"9144714","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2) is to perform a pragmatic and efficient replication of TACT1 in patients with diabetes and a prior heart attack. The results of this trial will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes. TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. A Clinical Events Committee masked to treatment assignment will adjudicate events. Principal secondary endpoints will include: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) a composite of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent MI, or stroke; and (3) safety."
"9197811","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9140270","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many industrial processes produce difficult to treat wastewater containing environmental contaminates, in the form of dissolved solids, that must be purified before being discharged. Typically, wastewaters are generated from metal finishing and plating operations, rinsing of printed circuit boards and semiconductors during fabrication, water used for cleaning and painting in automotive manufacturing, food and beverage (concentration of wastewater for reuse and reduction of BODs prior to discharge), pharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as landfill leachate. In many cases, wastewaters cannot be treated cost effectively. As a result, massive quantities of unpurified wastewater is land-applied for disposal,  disposed of underground, or discharged into our surface water supply leading to a significant impact on the environment. It has been observed that all conventional membrane processes currently used for wastewater purification are hampered by some form of membrane fouling. When treating wastewater using an osmosis membrane process, pretreatment of the wastewater is typically necessary to protect the membrane from organic fouling, mineral scaling, and chemical degradation. During our Phase I effort, we developed an advanced osmosis membrane technology with greatly improved anti-fouling characteristics by successfully modifying commercially available osmosis membranes with graphene oxide and superhydrophilic nanoparticle coatings. These modified membranes showed excellent antifouling characteristics and improved durability under challenge tests using high concentrations of organic and inorganic foulants. Furthermore, the modification process is universally transferable to all commercially available membrane technologies used for wastewater purification. During the Phase II effort, Lynntech will work to further advance this novel technology with specific aims devised to optimize the membrane coating technology leading towards commercial scale up, and perform outside testing at a commercial facility. These aims include (1) further optimization and improvement of the modification processes, (2) scale up the modification processes geared towards viable commercialization, and (3) packaging and testing the final product in a commercial setting. Successful completion of the specific aims will facilitate the pathway to commercialization of the novel technology with applications beyond the wastewater treatment, e.g., desalination, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. Implementation of these enhanced anti- fouling membranes will greatly reduce the membrane fouling within a wastewater purification system, reducing the necessary maintenance while maintaining or improving high purification standards."
"9201595","Abstract. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death among aged people, and currently, more than 5 million people have AD in the US alone. Although there is no cure for AD, studies indicate that clinically proven medicines have the ability to slow AD's progress, especially if they are administered early on. Obviously, to develop diagnostics that are able to detect AD at its earliest stages, long before AD symptoms appear, will have significant impacts on the disease's management. Also, being able to monitor the disease's progression over time will greatly help in finding new and improved medicines and treatment strategies for AD patients at all stages. Despite great progress in current clinical AD diagnosis using brain imaging or body fluid measures with amyloid-? (A?, whose plaques in the brain are a hallmark of AD) as an AD biomarker, there are concerns over these methods, which involve radioisotopes, expensive imaging equipment and complicated laboratory analyses. It is still hoped that an easy, cost effective, minimally invasive approach for routine A? tests could be found and used as another common tool of preventive medicine. To fill this need, we will further develop and translate our nanoparticle biomolecular detection technology, patented in the US, into commercial clinical tools as a simple, non-invasive approach to in vivo image A? deposits in the skin, which can provide more specific, sensitive and rapid results than current AD diagnostics. We hypothesize that A? deposits in the skin of AD patients can serve as biomarkers and be specifically captured by A? antibodies labeled with near infrared (NIR)-quantum dots (Qdots) in vivo; the NIR-Qdots can provide very stable, strong signals, and be detected easily by common imaging systems with high signal/noise ratio, thus enabling to in vivo spot the A? deposits at very low levels. This hypothesis is based on evidence including: (1) the A? does not just exist in the brain, causing AD, but rather systemically presents in the whole body, (2) A? deposits have been detected in vitro by immunoassays in skin specimens of AD patients, and (3) NIR-Qdots with surface targeting modalities can serve as ultrasensitive probes to detect targets both in vitro and in vivo. To prove our hypothesis, an aim is proposed: to generate effective A? probes by conjugating its antibodies with NIR-Qdots and characterize them, then to in vivo visualize the dermal A? deposits after intradermal injection of the probes into AD mice at different disease stages via fluorescent imaging systems (blood, brain, spinal fluid and skin A? levels will be evaluated ex-vivo for comparison), and finally to examine the NIR-Qdots' potential toxicity by testing their biodistribution in vivo. The probe generation will be conducted based on methods we have used before, and the in vitro and in vivo studies will be performed following standard protocols. We believe that this SBIR Phase I study will demonstrate the proof of concept and lay the foundation for the following Phase II study towards commercialization. Our study will impact AD prevention, management and drug development."
"9124533","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Elevated circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) are a significant risk factor for multiple disease states including obesity, cardiovascular disease, as well as various cancers. In addition, saturated FFAs trigger a cascade of pro-inflammatory signals that promote cellular dysfunction and apoptosis, a condition known as lipotoxicity. Thus, maintaining proper homeostatic control of lipid metabolism is pivotal for optimal cellular function Previous research has suggested that channeling excess cellular FFAs into triglyceride synthesis pathways for energy storage can ameliorate these lipotoxic effects1-3. A key enzyme in this biosynthetic pathway, stearoyl- CoA desaturase (SCD1), converts saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to their monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) counterparts as a prelude to triglyceride synthesis and storage as cellular lipid droplets (LDs). Overexpression of SCD1 has been shown to promote LD formation and prevent palmitate-induced lipotoxicity4. Emerging evidence has shown that ER-associated degradation (ERAD) plays a substantial role in regulating cellular lipid metabolism. For example, studies have suggested that mammalian SCD1 is post-translationally degraded through an ERAD pathway, but the details of this mechanism have not been described. My proposed research will: 1) use quantitative proteomics and analytical molecular biology techniques to comprehensively define the ERAD pathway that degrades SCD1, and 2) utilize morphologic and lipidomic approaches to characterize the functional contributions of ERAD and SCD1 degradation to cellular fatty acid metabolism. Together, these studies will advance our current understanding of the post-translational regulation of SCD1, bridge the gap in knowledge between ERAD and fatty acid metabolism, and uncover new strategies in metabolic disease research."

"9353947","Optimal functioning of the nervous system requires selective wiring of neural circuits, the precision of which is achieved through experience-dependent refinement after birth. A classic model system of experiencedependent neural development is ocular dominance plasticity in the visual system, where monocular visual deprivation in a critical period of early life shifts cortical responses. The investigators have recently discovered that normal binocular vision in the critical period drives the matching of orientation preference between the two eyes in the visual cortex, thus revealing a physiological purpose for critical period plasticity in normal development. The proposed experiments aim to study the synaptic and circuit mechanisms of the newlydiscovered binocular matching process. First, single unit extracellular recording, in vivo whole cell recording, and computational analysis will be carried out to determine how visual cortical cells respond to binocular stimulation before the critical period and the role of synaptic inhibition in this binocular integration process. Second, chronic 2-photon calcium imaging will be performed to reveal how individual cortical cells change their monocular orientation tunings to match between the two eyes. Finally, the investigators will investigate the role of inhibition in the binocular matching process by studying the consequence of reducing inhibition, and by studying binocular response properties of subtypes of inhibitory interneurons. Together, these experiments will provide important data needed for a complete understanding of binocular matching. Because ocular dominance plasticity and its critical period is a model system for human amblyopia and strabismus, a full understanding of cortical changes that normally take place during development will have important implications for the understanding and treatment of these diseases."
"9257125","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Insulin resistance (IR) is a state of metabolic dysfunction that precedes Type II diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. IR is characterized by an impaired ability of insulin to promote plasma glucose disposal into insulin-sensitive tissue, the majority of which is skeletal muscle (SkM). Before insulin can stimulate muscle glucose uptake (MGU), it must first be physically transported from the plasma, across the continuous endothelium of SkM capillaries and into the interstitial fluid that bathes myocytes. In fact, the ability of insulin to stimulate MGU depends on the rate at which insulin crosses the capillary endothelium. Furthermore, preliminary data from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that insulin transport across the endothelium is impaired in the insulin resistant state. Despite the importance of insulin transport to insulin action, the mechanism of endothelial insulin transport and its long-term regulation in vivo are poorly understood. This proposal will focus on two Specific Aims to define the mechanisms that regulate insulin transport in vivo. These Specific Aims will test the hypotheses that (1) endothelial insulin transport is an active process that requires caveolar vesicles and the insulin receptor and (2) obesity-induced defects in insulin transport are rescued by exercise training through a nitric oxide(NO)-dependent mechanism. To study insulin transport in vivo, I have developed a highly innovative imaging technique to measure capillary permeability to a fluorescent insulin probe in live mice. This technique will be combined with conditional, endothelial-specific genetic modifications in mice to delineate the role of caveolin-1, the insulin receptor, and NO to insulin transport. The effects of these manipulations on SkM insulin sensitivity will be assessed using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with isotopic glucose tracers in conscious, unstressed mice. The proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which insulin transport is regulated acutely and in response to chronic stimuli (obesity and exercise). The results of these studies will improve the prospect of developing therapeutic strategies that target the vasculature and SkM insulin delivery in the treatment of T2D."
"9181216","Project Summary/Abstract Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for normal brain development in humans and in animals. Thus, it is important that a large number of manufactured chemicals can interfere with TH action, and by a variety of mechanisms. Some chemicals interfere directly with the TH receptor (TR) while others directly affect the thyroid gland, or serum binding proteins, deiodinases or transporters. The long- term goal of our work is to understand the mechanisms of ?thyroid disruption? and apply this to human populations. Our earlier work has demonstrated that specific polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can activate the TR in a cell-based luciferase assay only if the enzyme CYP1A1 was induced and active. This enzyme can hydroxylate parent PCBs, and these OH-PCBs may then act directly on the TR or may act on other proteins that control TH action. Importantly, in animals treated with specific PCB congeners, there is a tight correlation between CYP1A1 induction and measures of TH action in the liver. More recently we have shown this to be true in human placenta as well: CYP1A1 expression was very strongly correlated with the expression of two genes directly regulated by TH ? Placental Lactogen (hPL) and Growth Hormone Variant (GHV). These findings are consistent with the proposition that manufactured chemicals may interfere with TH action during development in the absence of changes in serum TH concentrations. However, we have not identified the chemicals involved or the mechanism by which they may act. We propose now to pursue this work with two Specific Aims: First, to measure PCBs and OH-PCBs in the placental samples (n = 30) that had the highest and lowest CYP1A1 expression in our previous report. This comparison should identify specific congeners and metabolites that we can pursue in Specific Aim 2 to test their ability to the TR using cell-based and biochemical assays."
"9132611","Project Summary/Abstract Crude mortality has been used by the public health community as a cornerstone for defining a public health emergency. Typically mortality in emergencies is monitored by surveillance processes that are incomplete or surveys which are often done poorly and ignored where that is politically expedient. This project will attempt to establish two different techniques, both simpler than surveys, and less likely to be dismissed by critics. 1) The process of multiple source triangulation, or establishing the sensitivity of IDP and death tallies will draw upon methods used widely in TB programs and the monitoring of homeless populations in large cities, but is rarely used to assess mortality. This process of constructing a summary of all known deaths or IDP's, collecting an independent sample, and examining the overlap between the two listings can be rapid, and can potentially transcend the biases typical in death and registration records. The project will select places to enumerate and measure mortality in at least one population displaced by an acute disaster, and at least one population that is persecuted or associated with significant stigma'. 2) A statistically representative community-based surveillance network was established by RHA with the Ministry of Health in Fizi Health Zone, DRC. Community health workers recorded birth, death, and migration events. Preliminary analyses suggest that the surveillance system detected 93% of births and 87% of deaths, with a specificity >99% for both measures, and positive predictive values of 98% (births) and 91% (deaths). This project will attempt to see if a similar system can be established in the city of Goma, to monitor IDPs in an urban setting. While not applicable to all crises, IDPs in Nairobi and Jordan and other large urban centers where IDPs remain stable over months or years could potentially be monitored with this approach. Once established, collection of other desired information from a statistically representative sample could easily be added into the surveillance process. To maximize policy impact, the later years of the project will involve extensive coordination with CDC, OFDA, and other donors in an attempt to establish procedures for mortality measurement in the locations and with partners of priority to donors. Without a widespread and credible capacity to measure central outcomes like income, malnutrition, and mortality, funding of humanitarian emergencies will continue to be based more on political interests than on public health need, and successful life-saving relief operations will remain indistinguishable from ineffective efforts. By adding two new simple and inexpensive options to the toolbox of the humanitarian community, we can help develop a community focused on outcomes instead of processes."
"9353944","The photoreceptor synapse triad is a synaptic complex of great importance; physiologically, this is the site of the initial transfer of visual information, and the fidelity of information transfer is critically important for visual processing. The synaptic triad is characterized by the photoreceptor terminal, ON-bipolar cell dendrite and laterally distributed horizontal cell processes. Horizontal cells play a central role in generating the inhibitory receptive-field surrounds of photoreceptors and bipolar cells, as well as other, downstream retinal neurons. Horizontal cells participate in light adaptation, formation of center-surround receptive fields and generation of color opponency in retinal neurons. Vesicular-mediated transmitter release and proton secretion are leading candidates underlying horizontal cell output in the outer retina, although the cellular mechanisms and their sites of action are not yet fully understood. The long-term objective of this program is to understand the role of mammalian horizontal cells in visual information processing. This objective will be addressed by testing the hypotheses that 1) a regulated vesicular mechanism underlies GABA release and proton secretion from horizontal cell processes and their endings, and 2) horizontal cells participate in a pH-sensitive action on photoreceptors via VATPase, and an inhibitory GABA action on horizontal and bipolar cells. Specific aim 1 will test if a) vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is Ca2+-dependent, and determine the b) cellular localization and functional properties of the Ca2+ channel subtypes mediating Ca2+ signaling in horizontal cells. Specific aim 2 will test if a) vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is SNARE-protein dependent, and determine the b) cellular localization and binding partners of key vesicular and SNARE proteins mediating vesicle exocytosis, including V-ATPase, in horizontal cells. Specific aim 3 will test if horizontal cell vesicular exocytosis mediates a) a pH-sensitive action on photoreceptors via V-ATPase insertion into the synaptic vesicle and plasma membrane and b) GABA action at horizontal and bipolar cells. Experiments will a) evaluate V-ATPase activity in horizontal cell endings, b) determine if pH-sensitive horizontal cell action is mediated by V-ATPase dependent protons and/or other pH-regulating membrane proteins and c) determine if GABA mediates horizontal cell autocrine and bipolar cell feed forward action. Studies using morphological, electrophysiological and cellular imaging approaches will initially elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of regulated vesicular release and proton secretion from horizontal cells, and will determine horizontal cell action on the response properties of outer retinal neurons."
"9254955","Abstract The proposed project will implement and test a unique Virtual Reality Cognitive Training (VRCT) combined with concurrent cycling on a recumbent stationary cycle, also known as exergame that seamlessly integrates specific cognitive tasks into a virtual environment and is synchronized with cycling to promote cognition. Cycling through an interesting virtual environment will motivate and engage the older adult to participate in the exercise, and VRCT could augment cycling's effects on cognition. A further innovation is that the exergame will be developed as an Apple TV application, making it widely accessible and available. It will provide a low-cost VRCT exergame option that currently does not exist, one that is affordable and compatible with almost any stationary cycle. This project is significant because treatment that delays the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by five years could save the U.S. economy an estimated $89 billion by 2030 and no drugs can yet prevent, cure, or even slow AD. Aerobic exercise and cognitive training are two such promising interventions. Emerging mechanistic studies further suggest that the two interventions together may have a synergistic, superior cognitive effect than either intervention alone. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the exergame intervention on cognition through two phases. In Phase I, a prototype of the VRCT exergame will be developed, followed by a feasibility testing using a single-group mixed methods design. In Phase II a more fully-featured version of the VRCT exergame will be developed followed by a an RCT which will randomize subjects on a 2:1:1 allocation ratio to 3 parallel groups (exergame:cycling only:attention control). Mixed methods will be used to assess outcomes in both phases. This project is innovative because the older adult user will be able to cycle through a virtual world displayed on a flat screen TV with specific assigned cognitive tasks to accomplish during cycling; the exergame will be widely accessible and available; and the exergame provides a low-cost VR exergame option that currently does not exist."

"9206966","Project Summary Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) remain a critical population in need of empirically supported approaches to improve self-management to promote reduced HIV sexual risk behaviors and substance use. The Young Men?s Health Project (YMHP), a structured and manualized 4-session intervention utilizing motivational interviewing, personalized feedback, and problem-solving skills building approaches for HIV- negative or untested youth was found to be efficacious in significantly reducing substance use and condomless anal sex (CAS) among YMSM ages 18-29. To date, this is the first and only RCT of any published trial or CDC DEBI with YMSM to show significant reductions in both substance use and sexual risk. The CDC recently rated YMHP as ?Best Evidence? and placed it on the compendium of Evidence Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. YMHP was tested through an efficacy trial in a research center environment with numerous inclusion and exclusion criteria, and thus, a real-world-based replication is the crucial next step in studying the intervention?s effectiveness in the real world when delivered by front-line staff to their clients. We will conduct a comparative effectiveness trial (CET) with two modalities of YMHP delivery ? clinic-based and telephone-based ? at three HIV clinic sites in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Miami. The Specific Aims are to: 1) adapt the YMHP intervention for clinic and phone delivery in HIV clinics by community health workers (CHWs); 2) compare the effectiveness of clinic-based versus phone-based delivery of YMHP in the context of health care access, assessing the cost effectiveness of both modalities and the five components of the self- management model; and 3) test a sustainable model of YMHP implementation in real-world adolescent HIV clinics. The proposed study will be implemented over two phases. In Phase 1 we will conduct qualitative research with staff at our collaborating clinics (to understand implementation issues) and YMSM ages 15-17 (to adapt the efficacious YMHP intervention to be developmentally appropriate). In Phase 2 we will randomize 270 YMSM ages 15-24, to receive YMHP by phone or in person at the clinic. Assessments will include behavioral self-report measures, urine testing for substance use, and STI testing for sexual health outcomes. Working together with our clinic collaborators will help to address practical problems at the frontline of service provision to pave the way for a comprehensive program to reduce HIV infection among YMSM. If effective, our program has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions for YMSM."
"9320338","Fibrosis is defined by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) such as collagen and fibronectin in and around damaged tissue, which can lead to permanent scarring, organ malfunction and, ultimately, death. Although we have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis the translation of these findings to humans has been limited and no proven therapeutic strategies can yet detect or prevent the disease progression. We discovered Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteines (SPARC) related modular calcium binding 2 (SMOC2) to be amongst the highest upregulated genes in the kidneys of mice subjected to chronic progressive kidney fibrosis. The mRNA and protein levels of SMOC2 were confirmed to be increased (10 to 60-fold) in three mechanistically distinct mouse models of kidney fibrosis as well as in patients with biopsy-proven kidney fibrosis. In the human fibrotic kidney, SMOC2 was concentrated in epithelial cells of the tubular region while also dispersed around the ?-Smooth Muscle Actin positive myofibroblasts of the interstitial tissue. In cell culture experiments, recombinant SMOC2 activated fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate - features typical of transitioning into the effector cell of repair ? Myofibroblast. SMOC2 treatment of primary human proximal tubular epithelial cells significantly increased vimentin staining (a marker of epithelial cell de-differentiation) along with an increase in cell size ? typical of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT); coupled with a decrease in cell number (features of the profibrotic TGF? pathway). We also found that transgenic mice overexpressing SMOC2 showed significantly enhanced tubulointerstitial fibrosis characterized by substantially higher myofibroblast activation, neutrophil infiltration and collagen accumulation following unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced kidney fibrosis. These results have led us to hypothesize that SMOC2 is a key signaling molecule in the pathological secretome of a damaged kidney that plays a critical role in the reparative scaffold; whose continual presence leads to fibrosis. The objective here is to investigate how induction of SMOC2 in fibroblasts and epithelial cells regulate initiation and progression of kidney fibrosis and whether genetic or pharmacologic modulation of SMOC2 is capable of altering the ultimate outcome from kidney fibrosis. Given that there is no information on the functional significance of SMOC2 upregulation following kidney damage the proposed studies aim at uncovering a novel pathway which may provide opportunities for targeted therapies for patients with kidney fibrosis ? an unmet medical need."
"9139873","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The social norms marking approach to health promotion is an environmental change strategy that targets the entire social context surrounding dating and sexual violence. Whereas community-wide social norms marketing campaigns have been successfully implemented to address a range of public health issues, research has yet to rigorously examine the efficacy of social norms marketing as a community-level change strategy for dating and sexual violence prevention. Understanding the unique contribution of social norms marketing campaigns in promoting environmental change is a vital first step to understanding their role as part of a comprehensive multi-level violence prevention approach. Results of this research will make a significant contribution to the evidence base of violence prevention by testing a comprehensive, tailored, data-based social norms marketing campaign for middle schools that addresses misperceptions of: 1) the acceptability of dating and sexual violence; 2) gender roles; 3) sexual activity; 4) sexual communication/consent; 5) support for victims; and 6) bystander intervention. Students, parents, teachers and administrators will be targeted as carriers of community misperceptions through the implementation of community-specific posters, a Lunch and Learn Teacher Training, a Social Norms Video, a Teacher Workbook, a Parent Mailing, and a Parent Information Session. A School Resource Provider will work with a teacher champion to implement the campaign and identify/address kick-back. To identify environmental moderators of program effects, the Resource Provider will work with school administrators to conduct a community readiness assessment, and document neighborhood characteristics that potentially influence dating and sexual violence, such as number of alcohol outlets and presence of highly sexualized billboards or buildings. In the Refinement and Planning Phase, stakeholder interviews, establishment of a Research Advisory Board, consultation with experts in social norms marketing, and administration of an open pilot trial will be used to refine the campaign and research procedures. In the Intervention Phase, we will conduct a group randomized trial among 30 middle schools to demonstrate efficacy of the approach in reducing rates of dating and sexual violence and promoting change in community norms over a 6-month follow-up, relative to a wait-list control. In the Analysis and Dissemination Phase, we will conduct cost-effectiveness analyses, prepare project reports, and share study findings with schools and the scientific community. Partnership between researchers and a CDC RPE-funded community agency in this research will build local capacity and ensure that the campaign is both feasible and sustainable. If deemed successful, the final products of this research will ensure that the approach can be readily implemented in middle schools as one component of a multi-level prevention approach."
"9071071","Project Summary  Significant discoveries at UT Southwestern have set the foundation for the first molecular genetic and  biological classification of sporadic renal cell carcinoma of clear -cell type (ccRCC), the most common type.  Leveraging this innovation, we seek to assess the prognostic and predictive value of a mutated gene we have  discovered, build the first immunocompetent animal model of ccRCC reproducing the genetics of human  tumors, and identify novel targets for drug development. We discovered that the tumor suppre ssor gene BAP1  is mutated in 15% of sporadic ccRCC and that BAP1-deficient tumors tend not to have mutations in a second  tumor suppressor gene PBRM1 (mutated in 50% of ccRCC). We developed and validated  immunohistochemistry tests and found that whereas BAP1-deficient tumors tend to be of high grade, PBRM1-  deficient tumors are typically of low grade. In patients with localized disease, BAP1 loss was associated with  significantly worse prognosis (HR for RCC-specific death, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.3-4.1; p=6.77?10-14). By leveraging  samples from the International mRCC Database Consortium, a consortium that has already introduced  changes in clinical practice, we seek to determine whether BAP1 loss leads to more aggressive tumors even  in the metastatic setting. Based on our previous discovery that BAP1 loss is associated with mTORC1  activation, we will also test whether BAP1 is a biomarker of responsiveness to mTORC1 inhibitors clinically.  Notably, both BAP1 and PBRM1 genes are located in the proximity of VHL (which is inactivated in >80% of  ccRCC) in a region on chromosome 3p that is deleted in the vast majority of ccRCC. This may explain a  longstanding paradox ? why do humans with VHL germline mutations develop kidney cancer, but not Vhl+/-  mice? We found that in mice, Bap1 and Pbrm1 are on different chromosomes than Vhl. Thus, LOH of the Vhl  region in the mouse would still leave two copies of Bap1 and Pbrm1. We predicted that combined inactivation  of Vhl and Bap1 (or Pbrm1) would cause ccRCC in the mouse but have been prevented from fully testing this  hypothesis due to renal failure and perinatal lethality of mice with conditional loss of Bap1 in the kidney.  However, conditional loss of Vhl is tolerated up to a year of age and VhlF/F;BapF/+ mice develop microscopic  RCC. To bypass perinatal lethality and obtain macroscopic tumors, we will inactivate Vhl and Bap1 in the  adult nephron. Finally, BAP1 is lost in tumors and consequently is not a suitable target for therapy. BAP1 is  a deubiquitinase, and to develop the next generation of therapies, we will identify BAP1 substrates implicated  in renal cancer. If successful, these aims will identify patients most likely to respond to mTORC1 inhibitors,  help stratify patients with metastatic disease, lead to the first faithful immunocompetent animal model of  ccRCC, and, following the path from gene discovery to drug development of Project 1, pave the way for the  next generation of targeted therapies."
"9192304","The objective of this project is to design, fabricate and evaluate a new, muscle-driven ambulatory assist system suitable for clinical testing in the home and community environments that maximizes the functional mobility of individuals with motor complete thoracic level spinal cord injury (SCI). Paralysis from SCI causes rapid degeneration of almost every major organ system. Commercially available externally powered robotic exoskeletons can begin to address such immobility in rehabilitation and supervised settings, but do nothing to counteract the disuse atrophy of the large lower extremity muscles and ensuing cardiovascular deconditioning. The maximal walking speeds and distances achieved with these devices fall far short of those necessary for safe and effective ambulation in the community. As a result, veterans with SCI are still unable to access many physical locations and life opportunities important for unrestricted reintegration into society.  The ?hybrid? approach we propose is radically different from wearable walking robots. Our ?muscle first? strategy derives the primary motive power for walking and other maneuvers by eliciting relatively short bursts of high intensity contractions from the otherwise paralyzed muscles with electrical stimulation. Internalizing the primary power sources means the external components only have to lock/unlock the joints or shape the ballistic limb trajectories generated by the contracting muscles, thus eliminating the need for heavy motors at each joint and enabling users to reap the considerable physiological benefits of exercising their lower extremity muscles. The implanted neuromuscular component of our hybrid system is also continuously available for spontaneous exercise and short duration standing and stepping even without donning the external component.  Stimulated contractions of the hip, knee and ankle muscles routinely generate sufficient power to maintain full weight bearing for several minutes, as well as to accomplish stepping motions for short distances without the need for powered exoskeletons. However, hip flexion can be inconsistent with stimulation alone, especially when attempting to climb steps or walk up ramps. We propose to augment stimulated contractions with a mechanical subsystem consisting of small, lightweight and efficient brace-mounted motors located at the hips. When powered by the contracting muscles, this novel configuration will stabilize the hips during stance, freely rotate during swing, and provide the low-level torques required to consistently achieve the desired limb movements in spite of variations in walking surfaces or stimulated responses. Since the motors only need to provide the incremental torques necessary to augment the stimulated hip muscles and shape the limb trajectories, the entire external structure can be significantly smaller, lighter, and quieter than commercially available powered exoskeletons based on a ?motor-first? strategy. Active knee extension will be generated by exciting the femoral nerve which routinely generates sufficient torque to stand and walk, while a similar mechanism to that proposed for the hip will lock during standing or mid-stance to rest the stimulated muscles, unlock during swing and stair ascent, and assist knee flexion immediately prior to swing. The mechanism will damp the impact of foot-floor contact, and gently lower the body during stair descent or transitioning from standing to sitting. A simple spring-assisted ankle brace will protect the foot and raise the toes during swing, while strong stimulated contractions of the calf muscles provide the propulsive power to drive walking at speeds far beyond those reported for existing exoskeletons.  This project will define a practical clinical intervention to restore long-distance walking at near normal speeds suitable for daily activities and community use. After benchtop and laboratory testing, selected users will attempt to negotiate unrestricted community environments with the hybrid system. The proposed hybrid neuromechanical gait assist system should enable paralyzed veterans to return to healthy, productive and socially engaged lifestyles which will have significant impacts on quality of life and societal participation."
"9286282","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a tight barrier formed by microvessels and capillaries that control the passage of nutrients, fluids, metabolic products, and drugs between the blood and the brain. Impaired function of the BBB is involved in a number of major pathologies afflicting the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, brain manifestations of AIDS, stroke, and cancer. Although the neurotherapeutics sector is among the largest and fastest growing markets in the pharmaceutical industry, progress is currently impaired by the lack of in vitro assays that reliabl predict in vivo BBB permeability. None of the existing models adequately replicates the organotypic microenvironment of the BBB, in which brain endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes (PCs) and astrocytes (ACs) are arranged in a characteristic architecture. The proposed work utilizes organ-on-chip technology recently developed by Nortis, Inc. for creating 3D tissue microenvironments in disposable microfluidic chips. The chip design enables the integration of living, lumenally perfused microvasculature, making it suitable for studying barrier function. Strikingly, extensive preliminary data indicate that human brain ECs, PCs, and ACs have the capacity to self-assemble into a BBB-like architecture within the Nortis chip. This data will be leveraged to further develop and eventually commercialize BBB models of mouse and human. The objective of Phase I is to achieve a model that replicates critical BBB functions of the mouse brain. The mouse model will be developed and optimized for viability, structure, and function. Expression of tight-junction (TJ) proteins and the transporter P-glycoprotein, an important functional characteristic of the BBB, will be measured. Microvessel permeability will be assessed by perfusion with fluorescently labelled molecules (Aim 1). The model will then be challenged with the barrier-modulating compound lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and evaluated for associated changes in TJ protein expression, molecule permeability, and leukocyte transendothelial migration (Aim 2). During Phase II, the mouse BBB chip will be used to develop and qualify specific BBB assays, such as transferrin receptor transporter activity, BBB permeability challenge with LPS, and stimuli-induced leukocyte transmigration (Aim 1). Success criteria is an assay robustness of Z' ? 0.2. Aim 2 of Phase II is to develop a human BBB model. The human model will be optimized to recapitulate key structural and functional features of the BBB, including TJ formation, permeability, and transporter activity. To demonstrate utility, the model will be treated with LPS, mannitol, and angiotensin II and evaluated for associated changes in BBB structure and function. Each of these compounds has clinical relevance but acts by a different mechanism. Aim 3 is to qualify specific human BBB assays and establish relevance to clinical data. The products developed with support from this grant will significantly enhance progress in basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience research and will significantly advance therapy for numerous devastating diseases."
"9214562","Project Summary/Abstract Background: Antibiotic overuse threatens patient safety by causing adverse effects and threatens the effectiveness of antibiotics through the development of antibiotic resistance. However, studies to describe and interventions to address these safety risks have focused on visit-based antibiotic prescribing. Non-visit-based antibiotic use and prescribing has been largely invisible. In preliminary work, we found that 23% of patients who received an antibiotic prescription did not have an office visit in the study year. We have also found that clinicians prescribed 39% of antibiotic prescriptions on days when patients did not have visits. Non-visit-based antibiotic fills by patients and prescribing by clinicians may contribute to patients' risk of adverse events and hasten the spread of antibiotic resistance, but non-visit-based antibiotic prescribing has not been measured. Research Strategy: To measure and describe the safety risk and antibiotic resistance pressure from contemporary non-visit-based antibiotic use in the United States, we propose complementary specific aims using claims data and electronic health record (EHR) prescribing data. Our main hypotheses are that 1) non- visit-based antibiotic prescribing accounts for a significant proportion (>20%) of antibiotic use and 2) the majority (>50%) of non-visit-based antibiotic use is untethered to a proximate clinic visit or a chronic, recurrent problem. To address these hypotheses and plan for future interventions, we have 3 Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is to perform a retrospective cohort study of medical and prescription drug claims of care received by over 10 million commercial health plan and 50 million Medicaid enrollees to measure and describe non-visit- based antibiotic prescription fills relative to all antibiotic fills. Specific Aim 2 is to perform a cohort study of electronic health record (EHR) prescribing to measure and describe non-visit-based antibiotic prescribing as well as conduct a mixed-methods study of EHR data and qualitative interviews with clinicians to understand the rationales for non-visit-based antibiotic prescribing. Specific Aim 3 is to use the results of the national study, cohort study, and mixed-methods sub-study to develop an evidence-based toolkit that can be used by other clinicians, health systems, payors, and stakeholders to measure and address non-visit-based antibiotic use. Implications and Future Directions: In the near term, this project will open a novel research front, quickly expanding our understanding of antibiotic use in the United States. In the longer-term ? at a time when the US health care system is moving towards less visit-based care ? this project will lay the foundation for interventions to encourage judicious antibiotic prescribing and use, even in the absence of clinic visits. The ultimate goal of this project and subsequent interventions is to preserve antibiotic effectiveness, limit the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and to promote patient safety in ambulatory settings."
"9225491","Project Summary/ Abstract Develop a Prioritized List of Physical Design Interventions to Reduce Patient Falls This proposal seeks funding for secondary (additional) analyses of data generated from a completed study on patient falls, funded by the National Patient Safety Foundation in 2013. At the time of the original study, understanding of patient falls was mostly restricted to intrinsic factors of patients. While there was (and still is) an agreement among clinicians that physical design of the built environment constitutes a key factor contributing to patient falls, studies on this topic were few and scattered. Our aforementioned study used a novel methodological approach ? motion capture technology ? during scripted activities in a physical mock-up of a room and bathroom to identify the exact points in time when falls were initiated. Two additional necessary steps are needed for effective translation of the original study findings to interventions in actual sites of fall occurrence. First, while the list of physical design attributes and entities identified in the original study is new and informative for developing potential physical design interventions, the analysis did not provide information for prioritizing entities/attributes on the list. Since healthcare facility owners and providers continuously struggle with optimization of limited capital (during new constructions as well as during use of a facility), additional analyses are needed to prioritize the identified interventions and aid healthcare decision-makers in allocating available capital. This study will conduct additional analyses of our original data set to develop a prioritized list of physical design solutions, based on rank-ordered probability of fall occurrence. This proposed study is necessary before proceeding to the second step: rigorous empirical testing of hypothesized high-efficacy physical design alternative solutions generated from the original study to reduce patient falls (which will constitute a follow-up proposal from this study PI)."
"9358805","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal proposal for the USC Roybal Center for Financial Decision Making will continue and expand upon the work that we have already done to improve our understanding of how people reach decisions about issues affecting their economic status in old age. Building on earlier work, the renewal proposal focuses on the issue of complexity: which decisions are particularly challenging for individuals, which simplifications would improve decision making, and which interventions would be most helpful in improving the capability to make better decisions? We will pay attention to the costs of sub-optimal choices, distinguishing between cases in which suboptimal decisions in a complex environment may lead to large losses in welfare and cases in which complexity does not have substantial consequences. Simplifications of choice environments may reduce the likelihood of errors, but at the same time may also carry its own costs, if for example it requires reducing the set of options available. Our approach will be both conceptual (what is complexity; what dimensions matter most) and experimental. We will conduct a series of pilot projects aimed at understanding the effect of the choice architecture on decisions and understanding how the choice environment can be changed to improve decision-making. For the experimental part, we will rely heavily on the RAND-USC American Life Panel, but we also take advantage of natural experiments, and conduct cognitive interviews and focus groups where appropriate. We aim to translate the findings of the pilot projects into the development of decision tools as well as concrete recommendations for simplifications of choice architecture and language used to describe decisions people have to make."
"9239914","Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), a rapidly growing health problem in the United States, has created serious public and personal crises at both medical and financial levels. Developing therapeutic strategies for AD is of critical importance, as no cure is currently available. Accumulation of ?-amyloid (A?) in the CNS has been proposed to play a causative role in the pathogenesis of AD. Dysfunction of the innate immune system for A? clearance is crucially involved in cerebral A? deposition and in pathological progression. The resident microglia and bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages (BMDMs) are the key innate immune cells to clear A? in the CNS. During disease progression, microglia turn to a pathological phenotype and fail to clear A?. BMDMs show robust effects in A? elimination, revealing a target for developing A? clearance therapies for AD. In fact, the hematopoietic system for generating BMDMs is defective in AD patients. BMDMs as well as stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are significantly reduced in AD patients. SCF and G- CSF are the essential hematopoietic growth factors that regulate blood cell generation. Critically, elucidating the role of SCF and G-CSF in generating BMDMs and in restricting A? accumulation may help in developing a cure for AD. We have recently discovered that SCF+G-CSF not only enhances BMDM generation but it also increases BMDM recruitment and enhances BMDM phagocytosis of A?, and ultimately induces long-term effects in A? reduction and cognitive improvement in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. The objective of this project is to define how SCF+G-CSF regulates BMDMs to restrict A? accumulation and improve cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. We hypothesize that the SCF+G-CSF-increased A? clearance in the brain with amyloidosis is coordinated through the enhancement of BMDM generation, of BMDM recruitment, and of BMDM function in A? removal. Using approaches ranging from molecular biology to live brain imaging, this hypothesis will be tested through the following 3 Aims: Aim 1 will determine how SCF+G- CSF enhances BMDM production in APP/PS1 mice, Aim 2 will examine how SCF+G-CSF regulates entry of BMDMs into the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and Aim 3 will define how SCF+G-CSF increases BMDM uptake of aggregated A?. Through these 3 Aims, the interaction between BMDM-related A? removal and neuroinflammatory changes will also be examined. We expect these studies to define the mechanisms underlying the SCF+G-CSF-increased A? clearance and cognitive improvement. This project is innovative in the unique approach, originally developed by our group, of targeting the hematopoietic system to enhance BMDM-mediated A? removal by SCF+G-CSF. This study is significant as it will shed light on how SCF+G-CSF ameliorates the defective innate immune system in the AD-like condition to reduce A? load. Importantly, this research could be readily translated into clinical trials because SCF+G-CSF therapy has been approved by the FDA for bone marrow stem cell recovery after chemotherapy in cancer patients."
"9352907","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although anticholinesterase therapies have greatly improved the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), they have not been demonstrated to significantly slow the disease progression; and amyloid- directed therapies have produced disappointing results. A promising evidence-based and relatively side-effect free lifestyle approach is emerging as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. In cross-section and prospective studies, and a few randomized controlled trials; aerobic exercise-training has been demonstrated to improve cognition in older subjects. However, the mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. Because it is now recognized that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks can catalyze AD development, it is vital to test whether lifestyle adaptation shown to reduce CVD risks can favorably modify cognitive trajectories and markers of neurodegeneration. Such interventions may benefit those at an early and clinically discernible prodromal stage of AD such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Notably, such data are currently lacking in African Americans (AA)s who harbor higher rate of CVD risks and AD. For ~10 years, the Principal Investigator has conducted studies on the effects of fitness adaptation on cardiovascular (CV) health. Recently, he received 2 years of funding to examine the effects of 3-times/week 6-month aerobic exercise-training on cognition in the laboratory setting. This ongoing study has allowed the Principal Investigator to demonstrate the ability to recruit, enroll, test, collect and manage related neuroimaging pilot data in a predominantly AA sample. While such a laboratory approach to exercise intervention study is required to prove causation, such a design may not lend itself to real-life application, and is demanding for many economically and educationally disadvantaged older AAs experiencing early symptoms of cognitive deterioration. To logically extend this ongoing work, he seeks to initiate an 18-month study, testing real-life applicability o the effects of exercise adaptation on memory in a more ideal community setting. Collection of outcome measures at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month and 18-month will provide pilot data to inform dose and duration effects of exercise on outcome measures. In addition to augmenting enrollments, the proposed approach will bolster retention. The objectives of this pilot study, therefore, are to examine the feasibility of a community-based 18-month study (6-month active intervention and 12-month passive follow-up) aerobic exercise-training on neurodegeneration in AAs MCI subjects. We will test our hypotheses by randomizing subjects into one of 2 groups: 1.) aerobic-exercise; and 2.) stretch-exercise (control). We proposed that the aerobic-exercise group will perform better than control group on cognitive measures. Secondarily, we will determine whether training- induced changes in cognition relate to increases in brain volume. Explanatorily, we will also investigate intervention effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, selected CVD risk factors and biomarkers, cerebral oxygenation and Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIF-1?) gene expression, and Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE), to assess their mediation of training-induced changes in cognition. A team of experienced investigators in neuroimaging, neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and exercise physiology has been assembled to conduct this study. Working collaboratively with the District of Columbia Office on Aging (DCOA), the Directors of the Ward 6 Senior Wellness Center operated by DCOA, and the lead agencies on aging (community grassroots organizations supported by DCOA), we will recruit, enroll, randomize, and train participants at the wellness center. After obtaining informed consent and completing an initial assessment, participants will undergo initial exercise screening to determine their ability to exercise safely. Following randomization of 80 volunteers into aerobic-exercise (40) and control (40); baseline neuropsychological, neuroimaging and biomarker measurements will be obtained. Both groups will undergo 3 times/week supervised group-specific intervention at the wellness center for 6 months. After the initial 6 months of active intervention, the aerobic-exercise group will follow a  prescribed but free living 40 minutes, 3 time/week exercise regimen, while the control group returns to usual care. Baseline tests will be repeated at 3 month, after 6 months (active intervention period); and at 9, 12 and 18 months (passive follow-up period). Treadmill, lumber puncture (LP) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests will occur only at baseline and 6 months. Between groups changes in cognitive performance, biomarkers, and neuroimaging measurements will be compared using appropriate multivariate methods. While we remain cognizant of other planned or ongoing fitness and memory trial, the proposed study is unique in the sense that: it is a logical extension of our ongoing work; tests the proposed hypotheses in predominantly AA sample in whom paucity of data remains, and therefore, will advance reduction in health disparity; will obtain data at multiple time-points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 8 months) and therefore allow for the assessments of the effects of duration and dose of intervention on outcome measures; test the real-life applicability of the proposed intervention in a community setting; and generate pilot data on the mechanisms by which these interventions affects memory. Importantly, outcomes from this study may lead to practical and effective strategy to delay cognitive decline in populations at most risk, and can prevent or attenuate the physical, psychological and the economic burden associated with dementia in AAs."
"9179809","Learning disabilities (LDs) affect up to 15 percent of children and lead to poor psychosocial outcomes and school failure1. To date, research on the etiology of learning and achievement problems has focused largely on endogenous, internal factors such as genetics, intelligence, and specific cognitive abilities like phonological processing and language development2,3 with little attention paid to the contribution of exogenous, environmental factors, such as neurotoxic exposures. This K23 application presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on a path towards becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator focused on using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study of the effects of neurotoxic environmental exposures on brain development and the manifestation of learning and achievement problems. The activities in this application build on the candidate's prior training and are set in a resource-rich environment that will foster her development of expertise in (1) advanced analytic methods of fMRI research; (2) environmental epidemiology; and (3) theoretical models of the neural bases of learning disabilities. Through combining fMRI and environmental epidemiology, the current research proposal seeks to (1) evaluate associations between ETS exposure and neurobehavioral outcomes; and (2) define a novel phenotype of learning and achievement problems that derives from prenatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The overarching hypothesis is that functional abnormalities in frontostriatal circuits in children with prenatal exposure to ETS contribute to impairments in cognitive control and academic skill deficits. The study will use fMRI to assess the functioning of frontostriatal control circuits in 40 seven-year-old children with different levels of prenatal ETS exposure, selected from a prospective cohort study. This design will allow the candidate to test a direct link between prenatal exposure to ETS, cognitive control, and academic skills, thus informing the neurobiological basis of a novel phenotype of learning and achievement problems. This training and research program will facilitate the candidate's transition to an independent research career, will help identify public health interventions to improve children's safety in the environment, and provide a viable target for early intervention and prevention of learning and achievement problems. RELEVANCE: The novel application of fMRI to the study of environmental causes of learning and achievement problems will shed light on unstudied causes of these problems, thus filling an important gap in the research literature. These data will test the concept that exogenous, preventable environmental factors contribute to the development of learning and achievement problems, thereby expanding LD research beyond its current focus on endogenous factors. Long term, results may be used to inform: 1) the development of novel therapeutics to treat this ETS-associated learning problem phenotype; and 2) public policy messaging, which currently does not provide information about ETS exposure and risk for learning problems18."
"9239936","Project Summary Globus Genomics has been developed at the Computation Institute, University of Chicago as an advanced genomics analysis platform running as a Software-as-a-Service on Amazon Web Services, powered by Globus and Galaxy. It was developed to meet the needs of both researchers and core lab providers who require a high-quality service with state-of-the-art capabilities to help streamline data movement, simplify the creation of genomics analysis pipelines, automate the execution of those pipelines, and run analysis at very large scale on elastic compute infrastructure. Globus Genomics, under development for three years, has been used extensively by researchers at leading institutions, including University of Washington, University of Chicago, Washington University St. Louis, Georgetown University, and Johns Hopkins. There is significant potential and demand to expand use of the service to meet the rapidly growing genomics analysis needs of both existing users and large communities of new users. We now propose work that will amplify the utility and impact of Globus Genomics by providing (1) scalability to 1000s of simultaneous analyses by 1000s of users, (2) support for state-of-art high performance workflows and tools, including large-scale imputation analysis and consensus calling on structural variants, (3) automated cost and performance optimization to slash cloud computing costs and turnaround times, and (4) powerful dashboards for end-to-end and summary views of large-scale analyses. These enhancements will be enabled by development in the following key areas: enhancing and extending the Globus Genomics computational framework to enable high-performance reliable execution of standard and novel NGS analysis workflows on large and extremely large datasets; creating and maintaining state-of-the-art pipelines for variant calling, whole genome analysis, RNASeq and ChipSeq, which involves computationally profiling the latest versions of tools and understanding different computational modalities for optimal execution on Amazon Web Services; creating a profiling and optimization framework to enable automated, cost- and/or time-optimal configuration of NGS applications and workflows on large cloud systems; and creating an automatic computational provisioning framework. The grant award would allow us to address key needs of current and prospective users and thus to provide an important bioinformatics platform to researchers who otherwise could not easily access such capabilities.  "
"9360146","Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is estimated to have infected one third of the world's population based on reports from surveys on positive skin tuberculin tests. There are 22 high-burden countries globally, among them Ethiopia, accounting for 80% of all active tuberculosis cases. The clonal relatedness of strains circulating in humans and other potential reservoirs is poorly understood. Molecular epidemiology is gaining importance in tracking strains and addressing key public health challenges to prevent and control communicable diseases in Ethiopia, including tuberculosis (TB). Ethiopian pastoralist populations have been neglected despite their vulnerability to various infectious diseases. Surveillance of TB in these areas is also minimal. As pastoralists rely on livestock products, a significant, largely unexplored challenge is the potentially high level of transmission of tuberculosis between livestock and people. There is currently no effective vaccine protecting humans against TB. The Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine consisting of attenuated Mycobacterium bovis preparations is the only approved vaccine against TB, but no longer provides protective immunity in some populations. Another challenge is the need of prolonged antibiotic treatment which, if not properly completed, accelerates the development of Mtb multi-drug resistance. Major problems in high TB disease burden countries are human and environmental factors that contribute to a weakened immune system and can increase susceptibility to Mtb infection, recurrence of latent infection and high morbidity and mortality. Modern genomics tools will considerably impact the knowledge of transmission dynamics, the extent of strain diversity and molecular interactions of TB with its host environments. In the proposed partnership between Addis Ababa University (AAU) and J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), the objective is to build genomics capacity at AAU, with a focus on the typing of strains of Mtb and M. bovis using Illumina Nextgen sequencing technologies and, in demonstration projects, understanding the relationships of active TB disease with host components such as the human respiratory microbiome and protein-based analysis of immune responses in the respiratory tract. This proposal includes innovative systems biology research as well as a program training Ethiopian scientists in genomics disciplines and applications to infectious diseases. 2."
"9192454","The proposal outlines a research plan for David Wu, MD PhD, to perform postdoctoral training in the laboratories of Gokhan Mutlu, MD, and Yun Fang, PhD, for two years. The ultimate goal of this research project is to make discoveries in vascular biology that could be useful in promoting human health; another goal is to be- come fluent in the basic techniques in cellular and molecular biology, and ultimately to jump start a research program for the eventual application of a K-level award in vascular biology. During the 2 year mentored period, Dr. Wu will receive additional academic and scientific guidance from the mentors and an advisory committee at the University of Chicago. The overall research goal is to determine the role that shear stress plays on endothelial cell (EC) metabolism, which plays a fundamental role in endothelial activation. Endothelial activation is the process by which ECs have reduced barrier function and increased inflammation. That endothelial activation occurs with a significant upregulation of glycolysis is a recently discovered phenomenon. That low shear stress generated by ?atheroprone? blood flow (as opposed to high shear stress during normal, ?atheroprotective? blood flow) is important in determining endothelial activation is also well-described. However, how changes in shear stress produce changes in the metabolism of ECs is unknown. Dr. Wu now has confirmatory data that human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) exposed to atheroprone flow upregulate key enzymes in glycolysis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Dr. Wu also has preliminary data that suggests HAECs are unable to use their mitochondria to generate energy under atheroprone flow. Excitingly, he recently found that atheroprone flow led to normoxic stabilization of transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1? (HIF-1?), which is known to upregulate glycolysis in many other contexts. This is counterintuitive, as HIF-1? activity is thought to be suppressed in high oxygen tension settings, such as in arterial blood flow. Furthermore, Dr. Wu found that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling, increased in atheroprone flow (and working through RhoA and Rac1, small GTPases which modulate cytoskeletal organization), and also known to be a key mediator of atherosclerosis, also induces HIF-1?. Collectively, these results led to his central hypothesis: atheroprone flow-mediated modulation of LPA signaling through RhoA or Rac1 leads to metabolic changes in a HIF-1? dependent manner. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that HIF-1? stabilization is required for upregulation of glycolysis, mitochondrial insufficiency, and EC activation under atheroprone flow. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that atheroprone flow stabilizes HIF-1? through LPA signaling via RhoA and Rac1. The goal is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of shear-stress related changes in metabolism. Endothelial activation occurs naturally in atheroprone flow states (near valves and arterial branch points) ? this results in chronic inflammation and ultimately atherosclerosis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Thus, there is a significant need to better understand how shear stress induces metabolic changes and hence EC activation."
"8999529","PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 2)  Metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in bone is almost universally fatal. While new targeted  therapeutics have improved patient survival, resistance invariably develops. Treatment refractory bone  metastases lead to morbidity and mortality in patients with mCRPC. Long-term goals of this proposal are to  understand mechanisms of therapy resistance and strategies to overcome them. Studies of this proposal focus  on resistance mediated from the bone microenvironment. Specifically, using an osteogenic prostate cancer  xenograft, MDA-PCa-118, we found that treatment with cabozantinib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with potent  activity against p-MET and p-VEGFR-2, demonstrated striking initial responses. However, resistance rapidly  occurs, as first evidenced by viable cells tumor cells found in proximity to newly formed bone matrix. Because  prostate cancer bone metastasis presents with a unique bone-forming phenotype, we hypothesize that factors  released from tumor-induced bone lead to pre-existing resistance, in which the microenvironment has already  contributed factors that mediate resistance prior to application of therapy. To study the mechanisms of this  form of resistance, a secretome analysis was performed on conditioned medium from prostate cancer-induced  bone, which identified 121 bone-secreted proteins. Many of these bone-secreted proteins activate integrins  through paracrine effects, increasing tumor cell survival. We term these osteoblast-secreted paracrine factors  ?osteocrines?. Consistent with the involvement of integrins in therapy resistance, we found that FAK, the  downstream effector of integrin signaling, is highly activated in therapy-resistant tumor cells. Thus, we  hypothesize that osteocrines released from prostate cancer-induced bone form a pre-existing  resistance niche that mediates therapy resistance of prostate cancer cells through activation of FAK.  We will test this hypothesis by: (1) Examining the ability of selected osteocrines to confer therapy resistance  through activation of FAK; (2) Examining the effects of second-generation FAK inhibitors (VS-6063 or VS-  4718) on overcoming osteocrine-induced therapy resistance in xenograft mouse models; and (3) Conducting a  clinical trial to examine the toxicity and efficacy of a FAK inhibitor (VS-6063 or VS-4718) in men with treatment-  refractory bone-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  The studies would be paradigm shifting by demonstrating that the tumor microenvironment can provide a niche  of ?pre-existing resistance?, a mechanism of resistance in addition to tumor adaptation to therapy, which is  likely applicable to multiple therapies in mCRPC. The studies would also demonstrate the potential efficacy of  FAK inhibitors for treatment of bone-metastatic CRPC. In addition, delineating mechanisms of this ?pre-existing  resistance? will provide new predictive markers to guide therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance."
"9246664","Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded aggregated proteins in neurons. Since neurons are permanently postmitotic, efficient intracellular protein degradation systems are critically important for normal neuronal function. Recent evidence suggests that disruption of lysosomal degradation pathways directly contributes to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. We have previously shown that loss of function of lysosomal ATPase PARK9 (ATP13A2) leads to zinc dyshomeostasis, lysosomal dysfunction and a-syn accumulation. In addition, we and other found that PARK9 localizes to multivesicular endosomes and regulates exosome biogenesis. Here, we propose to further analyze the physiological role of PARK9 in generation and secretion of exosomes and how loss of PARK9 function contributes to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. First, we will test the hypothesis that PARK9 plays an important role in the formation of intraluminal vesicles by recruitment of zinc-dependent FYVE proteins to early endosomes. Second, we will examine if a-syn secretion via exosomes and lysosomal exocytosis contributes to PARK9-mediated neuronal dysfunction. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that PARK9 is protective in synucleinopathies by overexpressing PARK9 in mouse models that accumulate a-synuclein. We will also examine propagation of a-synuclein in PARK9 knockout and transgenic mice. These findings will also provide further mechanistic insights into PARK9 loss of function in the context of Kufor-Rakeb syndrome as well as more general forms of syncleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in terms of cell- to-cell transmission of a-syn that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders."
"9186072","Manganese (Mn) plays an essential role in normal growth and development; however, overexposure to Mn can result in neurotoxicity. This dual role of Mn as essential mineral and neurotoxicant appears as a biphasic dose-response curve for neurodevelopmental health outcomes in children. Children may be particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of ambient Mn exposure, as their brains are undergoing a dynamic process of growth, differentiation, pathway direction, and apoptosis, all of which can be influenced by environmental factors. Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) can provide novel, quantitative information about the effects of Mn on brain anatomy and physiology; yet these imaging methods have never been applied to an adolescent population exposed to chronic ambient Mn. Given the role of Mn as both nutrient and neurotoxicant, we anticipate that biomarkers of Mn exposure will exhibit a biphasic dose- response association with adolescent neurobehavior, neuromotor function, brain anatomy and physiology, and hypothesize that both low (1st quartile) and high (4th quartile) levels of exposure will be significantly associated with deficits in these domains. This overarching hypothesis will be addressed through two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate neurodevelopment with historic and current biomarkers of Mn in a cohort of rural adolescents in order to evaluate the impact of Mn from essential to excess on executive function, attention and reaction time, cognition, achievement, behavior, and neuromotor status. Specific Aim 2: Conduct a sub-study of adolescents based on previously determined Mn biomarkers using quantitative MRI/S in order to evaluate the effects of Mn exposure from essential to excess on neuroanatomy, metabolism, organization, function and connectivity. Neuroimaging outcomes (volume, metabolite concentrations, metrics for diffusion tensor, functional activation, and network connectivity) will be compared with historic and current biomarkers of Mn. This well-characterized longitudinal cohort study of adolescents will advance our understanding of the impact of Mn on neurodevelopment, and brain anatomy and physiology using innovative MRI methodologies. These patterns may be useful in defining the lines of essential benefit and neurotoxicological harm from Mn. The findings from this study will have regional, national and global implications for advancement of neuroscience and will be used to inform policy related to Mn in gasoline and ambient air standards. This proposal leverages the only cohort available in the United States that can directly address these aims."
"9252934","Abstract The lack of adequate lubrication is a major universal drawback for consistent and correct condom use. Consequently, improper condom usage leads to increased risks for the spread of STIs, including HIV. Inadequately lubricious condoms can also result in mucosal microtrauma, pain, increased chances of condom breakage, and decreased satisfaction between partners. The HydroGlyde Coating addresses these issues by providing uninterrupted superior lubrication that is activated with water thereby eliminating the need for additional lubrication to maintain the condom's lubricity. We expect that our novel self- lubricating coating technology will: 1) alter the negative societal stigma regarding condom usage; 2) encourage correct and consistent condom use and usage desirability; 3) reduce mucosal microtrauma; 4) decrease unwanted pregnancies and spread of STIs and STDs; and, 5) improve user satisfaction. We have developed and characterized the HydroGlyde Coating for latex condoms, as well as performed an IRB-approved touch- test survey which found human subject preference for the HydroGlyde coated condoms over non-lubricated latex samples or samples lubricated with KY® Liquid. These results projected the general population's interests in this technology, providing optimistic willingness to accept HydroGlyde coated condoms if introduced to the market. Our goal is to fabricate the HydroGlyde Coating prototype and coating application procedure to be adaptable towards large-scale manufacturing under GMP standards. We will collaborate with Biocoat Inc. and Boston University to complete the following aims:  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Transition of the HydroGlyde Coating technology prototype and application process  on male latex condoms to an industrial prototype under the coating expertise of Biocoat Inc.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: (a) Assess the physical, biocompatible, mechanical, and durability properties of the  HydroGlyde coated male latex condoms in comparison to commercially available lubrications and  lubricated condoms; (b) investigate in vitro cytotoxicity of potential leachables in an epithelial cell line  via an MTS transwell assay Development Plan. Successful completion of these aims will be critical for a Phase II SBIR application which will focus on: 1) biocompatibility and safety studies at TOXICON; 2) ISO testing; 3) accelerated stability and shelf-life studies; and 4) packing under GLP at GPC/Karax Berhad."
"9134137","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the first 5-year period of our BRP we had two major objectives:  1) to determine whether we could improve motor function of the lower limbs by neuromodulating the spinal lumbosacral circuitry with epidural stimulation and 2) to begin to develop and improve the technologies associated with electrode arrays and chronic implantable stimulation devices to maximize the neuromodulatory potential.  These new technologies have the potential to fine tune the epidural stimulation parameters, to help in understanding some of the underlying mechanisms of epidural stimulation., to examine synergistic effects of epidural stimulation, pharmacological modulation, and examine activity-dependent interventions that might affect the level of recovery of motor function after complete paralysis.  We have demonstrated that an adult rat with a complete, mid-thoracic spinal cord transection can regain full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and even directions when the spinal cord is stimulated tonically to increase the excitability of the lumbosacral locomotor circuitry.  Furthermore, we learned that load-bearing sensory information can serve as the controller of these complex motor tasks and that the performance of these tasks can be improved even further with combinations of epidural stimulation, pharmacological, and motor training interventions.  We have shown that four humans with a motor complete spinal injury have regained independent standing, assisted stepping, and even a significant level of voluntary control of the lower limbs in the presence of epidural stimulation, with one subject now even having some volitional control without stimulation.  Improvement in bladder control, blood pressure, temperature regulation, and even sexual function has been realized.  Thus, our present challenge is to develop the capability to selectively activate combinations of neural networks that can enable standing, and probably stepping, by improving the technologies needed to make this intervention available in the clinic and in the home of individuals with complete motor paralysis using a chronic epidural electrode implant.  Specifically, we will further improve the electrode array stimulation technology needed for fine-tune control in rats and humans and transform the present hardwired technology for rats to a wireless capability to stimulate and record evoked potentials along the brain-spinal cord-muscle axis in the rat.  To advance the clinical potential, we will continue to develop, refine and validate our machine-learning strategies which automatically optimize stimulation parameters for standing, stepping, and voluntary control.  We will develop an improved interface between the devices implanted in our present subjects and the control devices for defining the specific stimulation parameters needed for a given subject to perform a motor task in the clinic or at home."
"9181276","Summary: The goal of this research is to test the feasibility of applying the existing Holographic Waveguide (HW) technology to conduct comprehensive and objective clinical evaluation of binocular eye movement, accommodation and pupil size (oculomotor components). In humans, these components are intricately coupled to form coherent visual routines for viewing targets at different directions and distances (the triad). Abnormalities in oculomotor components and in their interactions are a highly prevalent health issue, often associated with visual symptoms and difficulties completing educational and work-related tasks. Current clinical oculomotor assessments typically evaluate individual oculomotor components in isolation and usually rely on the patient's subjective report and on clinician's subjective judgment. The difficulties caused by the lack of devices that can perform objective, simultaneous assessment of all oculomotor responses have long been recognized by clinicians and researchers alike. HW technology may serve as the platform for such a device. In a HW, light signal is coupled into a glass substrate at an angle satisfying the requirement of total internal reflection via a thin-film holographic in-coupler pasted at one location on the substrate, propagates in the substrate and is coupled out from the substrate at a different location via a matching out-coupler. It provides a highly compact and lightweight light signal pipeline--a piece of glass in front of the eye--that can conduct illumination light to the eye and also capture light reflected back from the eye. The purpose of the proposed research is to test the feasibility of using a HW-based oculometer to perform objective measurement all oculomotor components. To achieve this goal, two specific aims will be pursued. First, a desktop prototype of a HW-based oculometer will be developed. Near infrared light will be waveguided to a location in front of the eye to provide co-axial illumination. Reflections from the cornea, the pupil and the retina will be captured in front of the eye and will be waveguided to a camera and a wave-front sensor to extract eye movement and accommodation data. Second, the accuracy and precision of the prototype will be evaluated first with model eyes and then with young normal human subjects. The human subject evaluations will include fixation, saccade, vergence and accommodation recordings with the prototype. These recordings will be compared with recordings obtained with commercially available eye tracker and autorefractor. It is our goal to reach a 0.1o or better precision over a range of 15o of visual angles for eye movement and a 0.35 diopters or better precision over a range of 12 diopters for accommodation. If HW is proven a viable platform for oculomotor assessment, a HW-based, wearable, see-through clinical device will be developed that can assess all oculomotor responses objectively and simultaneously over longer period of time while the patient is engaged in normal visual activities, such as reading and writing at a desk. Not only will it improve the quality and efficiency of current oculomotor disorder care but will also improve diagnosis of intermittent, task-related, or emergent disorders."

"9135273","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Readmissions occur commonly among the elderly, are associated with suboptimal care and worse clinical outcomes, and contribute substantially to healthcare costs. In September 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. The policy financially penalizes hospitals with higher-than-expected 30-day risk-adjusted readmission rates for adults age 65 and older with heart failure, myocardial infarction, and pneumonia, and, as of 2015, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and arthroplasty of the hip and knee. Coronary artery bypass grafting will be added in 2017.  Readmission rates have declined since 2012 but favorable effects on long-term outcomes and costs are not assured. Survival could improve if hospitals improve inpatient and transition-related care, although length of stay and use of formal post-acute care could rise as hospitals strive to ensure clinical stability after discharge. Conversely, hospitals could engage in gaming, such as readmitting only the sickest patients, substituting observation stays for readmissions, or postponing readmissions beyond 30 days. Barriers to necessary readmission could lead to greater utilization of emergency department visits and worse survival. As hospitals create new systems of care, both favorable and unfavorable effects could affect patients not targeted by the policy.  This project seeks to evaluate the Program's effects on survival, healthcare utilization, and payments by Medicare, and to consider potential inadvertent effects. First, the project will evaluate how the policy has influenced beneficiaries' survival during the six months after hospitalization, an outcome important to patients. Second, the project will evaluate 30-day readmission rates, utilization of hospital and post-acute care, and payments by Medicare. Finally, the analysis will examine gaming by hospitals and spillover effects for populations not targeted by the policy.  Methods will involve using Medicare administrative data to measure changes in clinical and economic outcomes from before to after policy implementation, using an interrupted time-series design. To present results in formats that are easy for policymakers and stakeholders to understand, the analysis will use estimates from the models in simulations that predict outcomes with and without the HRRP. Lastly, because hospitals may respond differently based on the percent of revenue at risk, we will examine whether effects differ across hospitals according to each hospital's share of patients with Medicare insurance or each hospital's penalty size."
"9142275","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients commonly present to the Emergency Department with suspected kidney stone - broadly defined as acute, coliky flank pain radiating to the groin. Patients diagnosed with kidney stones represent 1% of ED visits, accounting for more than one million visits per year. One concerning trend in the evaluation of patients with kidney stones is the increasing utilization of CT scan despite a lack of studies comparing its effectiveness to older, more traditional methods of diagnosis with respect to patient outcomes. In fact, despite a 10-fold increase in CT scan utilization over the years of 1997-2006, there was no change in the rates of diagnosis of kidney stone, serious alternate diagnoses, or hospital admission for kidney stone. On the other hand, there is evidence that CT scans are associated with radiation exposure and increased cost. I propose to derive and validate a decision instrument to identify patients with suspected kidney stone. This decision instrument has the potential to allow emergency physicians to identify patients with suspected kidney stones at very low risk for a serious outcome (alternate diagnoses or complications requiring admission and or surgical intervention), in whom advanced imaging with CT can be deferred. A second concern is the uncertainty regarding the efficacy of medical expulsive therapy for patients with kidney stones. Despite evidence that medical expulsive therapy increases the rate of stone passage in patients diagnosed with kidney stones, a survey of national data from 2006 shows that only 4% of emergency patients receive this therapy. The objectives of this application are two-fold: 1) to improve the diagnostic strategy in patients with suspected kidney stone and 2) to improve the treatment for patients with kidney stones. Aim 1 now focuses on the development of a decision instrument for patients with suspected kidney stone using the rich clinical data already collected as part of the STONE trial. Aim 2 seeks to examine the utilization and outcomes associated with medical expulsive therapy in the STONE trial. We propose to perform an observational study comparing the outcomes including morbidity, health care utilization, and cost in the cohort of patients receiving medical expulsive therapy to the cohort of patients not receiving it. Furthermore, we propose to describe the variation and trends in the utilization of medical expulsive therapy. I anticipate positive impacts in the management of patients with suspected kidney stones after completing these aims. If Aim 1 produces a useful decision instrument, future research could be conducted to broadly validate and determine the impact of these rules and ultimately decrease CT utilization. If Aim 2 confirms the efficacy of MET, I would design implementation studies to translate this finding into clinical care. The experience and training I will derive from completing these aims can then be applied to other emergency department complaints to improve decision making, decrease testing and accelerate the adoption of proven therapies."
"9245443","ABSTRACT  Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries, in large part due to plaque rupture. Vulnerable plaques are the most likely to rupture, being the major cause of acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Neovascularization of the arterial walls by adventitial vasa vasorum appears to participate in the progression of atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic plaque neovascularization was shown to be one of the strongest predictors of future cardiovascular events. No techniques are currently available for the quantitative assessment of vulnerable plaque, which remains an unmet need.  Microbubbles are extremely powerful contrast agents for ultrasonic imaging of the vasculature and Contrast Enhanced IntraVascular UltraSound (CE-IVUS) seems to be one of the most promising imaging modalities for the detection of atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque. However, although this technique allows the detection of the vasa vasorum, CE-IVUS currently does not provide a quantitative characterization of its micro-architecture. The specificity of CE- IVUS needs to be improved.  A quantitative assessment of the vasa vasorum network in vivo would strongly predict cardiovascular events yet no such techniques currently exist. We propose using ultrasound multiple scattering to characterize the microstructural properties of neovascular networks. By using ultrasound multiple scattering to characterize the architecture of the neovascularization, we will add a new dimension to CE-IVUS. With the technique we propose to develop here, CE-IVUS will not only be used for the detection of plaque related neo-angiogenesis, but also for its quantitative characterization. This will dramatically increase the specificity of CE-IVUS for the assessment of plaque vulnerability. Ultimately, it will enable the ultrasonic assessment of the vasa vasorum to become a widely used clinical tool for screening, diagnosis and monitoring of plaque vulnerability."
"9201667","Problem: Over the last two decades, unintentional opioid-related overdose has emerged as a major public health threat in the United States. This increasingly common, yet preventable, cause of morbidity and death among users of prescription opioids is partially due to a substantial expansion in the prescription of opioid analgesics to manage acute and chronic pain conditions. Within any given year during the past five, 15% of the U.S. population filled at least one opioid prescription. In 2012, 259 million opioid prescriptions were written in the U.S. ? enough for every American adult to have one bottle of opioid painkillers in their home medicine cabinet. In 2013, nearly two million Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on opioid painkillers. Opioid poisoning or overdose deaths have more than quadrupled from 4,030 in 1999 to 18,893 in 2014. Total prescription opioid overdose costs in the U.S. were more than $20 billion in 2009.This is a significant and rapidly growing problem. Solution: Venebio Opioid Advisor (VOA) is a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on VG?s existing, patent-pending, risk-index algorithm that accurately identifies individuals at risk for overdose or serious opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) by utilizing evidence-based clinical data gathered from patient electronic medical records (EMRs) as opioids are being prescribed. VOA will be delivered via a stand-alone computer application, embedded in an EMR system, or alternatively located on a remote server accessible through a secure Internet connection. VOA will extract a patient?s relevant clinical data automatically from the EMR, assess the patient?s risk for opioid overdose, and present the patient?s risk score directly to the health care provider ? enabling evidence-based guidance and education that is personalized to the individual patient's specific risk factor profile. The ability to identify individuals at elevated risk of experiencing prescription opioid-related toxicity or opioid overdose will provide awareness of the individual risk level to both the health care provider and the patient. Methods: The overarching objective of our proposed Phase II research is first to refine and validate the clinical content used to create the existing Venebio Opioid Advisor algorithm, then to incorporate this refined information, along with the additional, evidence-based guidance and educational content, into a clinical decision support system, and finally to validate this CDSS during a prospective pilot study of VOA in the real-world clinical pain management setting."
"9073485","Project 3  Abstract   Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma  (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). KS is the  most common AIDS-defining cancer in HIV-positive individuals, although KS can also occur in  HIV-negative individuals. KS is a highly angiogenic tumor that is driven by KSHV-infected  endothelial-derived spindle cells, and KS lesions express high levels of cytokines and  angiogenic growth factors. We have found that KSHV infection significantly alters angiogenesis,  migration, and survival of endothelial cells. We have found that KSHV viral proteins upregulate  cytokines and chemokines and hypothesize that the upregulated cytokines and chemokines  play important roles in driving angiogenesis and cell proliferation of KSHV-infected cells.  Additionally, other cellular factors that are activated upon KSHV infection of endothelial cells will  be explored for their role in angiogenesis and the KSHV lifecycle. In this application, we  propose to determine how cellular and viral proteins promote endothelial cell migration,  angiogenesis and survival of the infected cell and how this shapes the tumor microenvironment.  We hypothesize that the modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, survival and the tumor  microenvironment by KSHV promotes oncogenesis and contributes to the pathogenesis  associated with KSHV infection. Thus, the proposed studies will provide significant and  biologically relevant insights into KSHV biology, and will also identify new targets for therapies  against KSHV-associated cancers."
"9051757","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although mortality due to stroke is decreasing, stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Participating in active rehabilitation aimed at  minimizing impairments and maximizing function can reduce disability caused by stroke. Unfortunately, up to 40% of individuals who have had a stroke are discharged home without rehabilitation services; instead these individuals are discharged home with recommendations to increase physical activity through a home exercise program and/or a community exercise program. Recent evidence suggests that individuals post-stroke do not participate in exercise programs or continue with the home exercise program received at discharge. The overall goal of this F32 postdoctoral fellowship is to develop a resource for individuals post-stroke that facilitates engagement in physical activity after hospital discharge. The objective of this researc training fellowship is twofold: (1) gain patient-centered understanding of the facilitators and barriers to physical activity immediately after hospital discharge and (2) tailor the physical activity components of an Internet-based program to address the needs of individuals post-stroke. The first objective will consist of questionnaires and focus groups. Questionnaires will be  administered to individuals post-stroke with chronic disabilities and those recently discharged home. This aims at identifying the unique barriers and facilitators to physical activity immediatel after hospital discharge. Individuals post-stroke, their caregivers, and rehabilitation therapists will participate in focus groups in order to capture all stakeholders' perspectives on factors that  impact physical activity after hospital discharge. The second objective consists of adapting an Internet-based physical activity program to address the needs of individuals after stroke, using those facilitators and barriers identified in the first objective. The outcome of this study, a strke-adapted physical activity program, could be used as a resource to bridge the end of rehabilitation with continued home recovery and potentially improve long-term outcomes and quality of life. This research responds to AHRQ's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan Goal 3C: Improve the accessibility and quality of supportive services for people with disabilities and older adults Goal 1C: Emphasize primary and preventive care, linked to community prevention services, and Goal 1E: Ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and support, for vulnerable populations."

"9245137","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT Laboratory alcohol challenges, in which researchers assess participants? responses to alcohol administered in a controlled setting, have provided the alcohol research community with important knowledge about the associations between individual responses to alcohol and risk for drinking-related problems. In recent studies in young adult heavy drinkers, our group showed that greater sensitivity to alcohol?s stimulant and rewarding effects was more predictive of future development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms than were lower responses to sedative or intoxicating effects. While laboratory-derived alcohol challenges remain the ?gold standard? for measuring alcohol responses, the time- and resource-intensive nature of this approach has hampered efforts to extend findings of alcohol challenge studies to intervention and epidemiological research. One potential solution to this problem is to develop and validate an accessible and user-friendly method to measure alcohol responses outside of the laboratory using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA methods assess individuals? behaviors and experiences in real-time and in their natural environment. Rapid advances in mobile smartphone technology and high adoption rates of these devices (86% of young adults own a smartphone) suggest that EMA alcohol response data may be collected via this portable and user- friendly method, e.g., providing data via text messaging and mobile web from one?s own smartphone. Our pre- pilot work suggests that using smartphones to measure alcohol responses in vivo is reliable, safe, and well- received by young adult heavy drinkers. The goal of this proposal is to build on this to further establish the reliability, validity, and safety of a smartphone-based EMA technique for measuring alcohol responses in drinkers? natural environments, and to examine associations with identical measures obtained via laboratory alcohol challenge. We plan to collect alcohol response data during at least 2 real-world drinking episodes from 64 young adult heavy drinkers (ages 21-29), and compare these responses with those obtained during a laboratory alcohol challenge. Safety of the smartphone procedure will be assessed by next-day and 2-week follow-up assessments of alcohol use and consequences, and by comparing those outcomes to a sample of n=20 heavy drinkers who will also complete these measures but not the smartphone/laboratory assessments. Estimated breath alcohol content (eBrAC) will be calculated during the smartphone-based assessments and actual BrAC will be measured during the laboratory challenge. Both the laboratory- and smartphone-based assessments will assess subjective alcohol stimulation, sedation, and reward (liking and wanting) using brief (~1 min), psychometrically sound measures. The results will contribute to knowledge on individual differences in alcohol responses in the natural environment. If shown to be reliable, valid, and safe, this new smartphone- based EMA technique could be used to inform future research on AUD risk assessment and treatment, as well as population-based work to examine changing patterns of drinking behavior and responses."
"9212214","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This type-2 application is to strengthen and build upon the established U54 Partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population, has the overall goal of attaining excellence in research focused on elimination of cancer health disparities and on reducing the cancer burden among underserved populations in the region. The partnering institutions possess unique strengths that complement each other in achieving the proposed goal through integrated research, education, and outreach. The primary objectives are to enhance productive cancer research programs, to develop a pipeline of racial/ethnic minority investigators in cancer research at MSM and TU, and to increase the level of involvement of investigators conducting research on cancer disparities at the UAB CCC. The Partnership has four Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Research Education, and Planning & Evaluation); two Full Research Projects; a Pilot Research Project; and two Shared Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). With these assets and activities, the Partnership will: 1) through the full projects, identify molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for metastatic prostate cancer, which is present at a higher rate in African American men, and, through the pilot project, adapt the current, successful patient navigation program for racial/ethnic minority recruitment at the UAB CCC for implementation at the MSM and Grady Hospital; 2) through the Outreach Core, apply an innovative cancer survivor care plan at MSM, TU, and the UAB CCC by linking community- and health system-based patient navigators and advisors to improve satisfaction with care, and implement culturally appropriate community health education for cancer survivors and caregivers; 3) through the Research Education Core, employ an integrated cancer research education program that involves capacity building and linkages to undergraduate and graduate students and junior faculty, allowing them to pursue careers in cancer research; and 4) provide funding for additional Pilot Research projects. The Planning & Evaluation Core will continually assess/evaluate the outcomes of the cores, research projects, and shared resources. The Bioethics Shared Resource will promote and ensure adherence to bioethical principles and address ethical considerations in relationships between the institutions and between the institutions and communities. The Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Shared Resource will deliver statistical and bioinformatics support for all activities. Together, we will contribute to elimination of cancer health disparities. "
"9345121","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the 1950s, life expectancy has risen at a steady pace, driven mostly by improvements in mortality at older ages. Functional status of the elderly has also improved, although gains have leveled off recently. These gains have been driven by advances in public health and a highly targeted disease model which independently delayed or forestalled mortality from major fatal diseases-through earlier detection, reduction of risk factors, and effective new treatments. Taken together, the social value of these improvements is tremendous-perhaps up to 50% of US gross domestic product. But these improvements do not come without costs. The United States has devoted an increasing share of its income to health care. Looking ahead, trends in medical innovation will increasingly carry important implications for the economy as a whole, with the health care sector representing almost 20% of the economy. With support from NIH, we have developed and used the Future Elderly Model (FEM) to better understand-and predict- future health, spending, and longevity consequences of these trends. This project will use the Future Americans Model (FAM), the extension of the FEM to ages 25 and over, to examine broader macroeconomic issues related to medical technology growth. We will first assemble technical expert panels to systematically identify technologies that will most affect Americans for the next 20 years, and assess their impact on disease incidence, disease management, morbidity, disability, mortality, and treatment costs. We will then project fiscal consequences of health care innovation scenarios using the FAM. Finally, we will introduce in the FAM a mechanism for innovation to respond to trends in population health and aging and analyze counterfactual population scenarios to study how demographic and economic trends influence innovation, health, longevity, and health spending over time. Overall, the project will constitute an important step toward understanding the `black box' of technology and its consequences for population health, spending, and the fiscal outlook."
"9245366","Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Intermediate-grade gliomas (Grade II and III) and glioblastomas (GBM, grade IV) are essentially incurable due to their diffusely infiltrative nature. The vast majority of intermediate-grade gliomas and secondary GBMs harbor heterozygous missense mutations in the metabolic enzymes IDH1/2. IDH1R132H mutation confers a neomorphic enzyme activity that converts ?KG to D-(2)-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG). D2HG is thought to be an oncometabolite that alters epigenetics by inhibiting ?KG-dependent dioxygenases and creates a cellular state that is permissive to malignant transformation. IDH1/2 mutations also cause widespread metabolic reprogramming that alters the bioavailability of macromolecule precursors and disrupts normal biosynthetic pathways. Gliomas harboring IDH1/2 mutations must therefore adapt to altered metabolic flux by increasing the rate of glutaminolysis through glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase enzymes. Consistent with this view, it was recently reported that glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (GLUD2), a hominoid-specific enzyme that catalyzes conversion of l- glutamate to ?KG (a TCA metabolite and macromolecule precursor), increases the growth of IDH1R132H gliomas in an experimental brain tumor model. GLUD1/2 activity is important for anaplerotic glutaminolysis, a process that increases bioavailability of ?KG for biosynthetic pathways via the TCA cycle. This pathway provides macromolecule precursors for lipogenesis and nucleotide synthesis and promotes biomass expansion in tumor cells. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that GLUD2 is highly expressed in IDH1R132H tumors, GLUD2 increases growth of IDH1R132H neural stem cells (NSCs), and targeting GLUD1/2 in IDH1R132H- expressing glioma cells inhibits the progression of intracranial xenografts formed after transplantation in mice. We hypothesize that adaptively evolved properties of GLUD2 are critical for resolving IDH1R132H-induced metabolic liabilities in gliomas, and inhibiting GLUD2 will limit or stop the growth of these tumors. We will test this hypothesis by characterizing the mechanisms underlying the essential role of GLUD2 in NSC maintenance and glioma growth in the context of IDH1R132H mutation. Furthermore, we will use multiple preclinical murine models of IDH1R132H glioma to evaluate the therapeutic potential of GLUD2 inhibition for malignant gliomas. Results from these studies will reveal essential functions of GLUD2 in NSC biology, characterize novel metabolic sensitivities that can be exploited for drug therapy in IDH1 mutated gliomas, and validate a novel therapeutic target for a lethal disease."
"9220160","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Intentional and flexible behavior, often called ?cognitive control?, requires the maintenance and selection of perceptual, mnemonic, and response representations consistent with the broader context and higher-level goals. One of the most challenging problems in neuroscience is determining how voluntary, goal-directed behavior arises from the distributed activity of billions of neurons in the brain. To tackle this problem, one must understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms of working memory (WM), a fundamental ability underlying goal-directed behavior. The study of WM, however, has only minimally benefited from the revolution in neural dynamics that has been experienced in other fields. Discovery of WM neural dynamics is particularly important given that WM requires the interaction of multiple brain systems, notably the lateral PFC (lPFC) and posterior processing systems. Thus, a determination of the neural mechanisms underlying lPFC function, the most elaborated neocortical region in primates, and WM, remains a fundamental goal of neuroscience research. To achieve this goal, three different methods will be implemented in human subjects in this proposal during the performance of WM task ? ECoG, fMRI and TMS. This will provide a convergent approach that tests hypotheses regarding the spatio-temporal basis of WM and will be able to determine the causality of the electrophysiological and neuroimaging findings. Although not the prime focus of the proposal, the ECoG data will also provide a link to monkey neurophysiology and the neural drivers of the fMRI BOLD signal. Basic knowledge about WM and frontal lobe function can provide substantial insights into the nature of a large number of psychiatric and neurological disorders affecting PFC function such as schizophrenia, dementia, stroke and traumatic brain injury; as well as many other conditions such as attention-deficit disorder, substance addiction and normal aging, that are proposed to involve selective dysfunction of frontal brain systems. Moreover, cognitive and behavioral deficits from PFC damage are particularly challenging to treat. A greater understanding of frontal lobe function is necessary for developing effective therapeutic interventions."
"9136710","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Language and communicative impairments following stroke (aphasia) affect more than 30% of stroke survivors, with an incidence of over 180,000 new cases annually. The consequences of aphasia are far reaching and can affect psychosocial adjustment, family role participation, vocational opportunities, and the ability to function independently in society.  Recent estimates suggest that VHA outpatient clinics see 2000 new cases of aphasia each year, meaning that approximately 20,000 enrolled VHA patients and 100,000 United States Veterans are currently living with the condition. In response to this need, the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC) initiated the Program for Intensive Residential Aphasia Treatment and Education (PIRATE) in January 2009.  PIRATE is a clinical demonstration project that provides approximately 100 hours of cognitive- linguistically oriented aphasia treatment to community dwelling Veterans over a 4-week period.  PIRATE currently serves 18 Veterans per year in bi-monthly sessions. Resource limitations associated with PIRATE and aphasia treatment in general require that treatments be offered in the most cost-effective doses to those Veterans most likely to benefit from them.   The proposed treatment-effectiveness research addresses these issues by examining the dose-response relationship for semantically-oriented naming treatment, and identifying cognitive, psycholinguistic and neuroanatomical predictors of treatment success. Study participants (n=50, over a 4-year period) will be recruited nationwide from Veterans enrolled in PIRATE. They will have their naming performance measured prior to PIRATE entry, during each week of treatment, and at program exit/follow-up. A battery of cognitive measures and structural magnetic resonance images of their brains will also be collected prior to treatment. Participants' performance on trained and untrained lexical items and a standardized measure of naming performance will be compared across time intervals to specify the therapy amounts for which maximum treatment benefits are achieved. Their treatment outcomes will also be correlated with specific cognitive test scores and the location and extent of their brain lesions to identify cognitive and neurological markers predictive of positive treatment response. Treatment response will also be compared across participants with different psycholinguistic profiles, to determine which groups of patients show greatest benefit from semantically-oriented naming treatment.   The proposed research should provide answers to two interlocking questions: for whom  is aphasia therapy most effective, and how much of it is needed to optimize treatment  outcomes. These answers have the potential to set transformative new standards for how aphasia treatment is delivered within VHA."

When patients are included in healthcare research, they are empowered to ask and receive relevant answers to questions they have about their health. Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) is designed to provide meaningful evidence that enables informed healthcare decision making by patients and other stakeholders. The University of Maryland (UM) is applying the concept of continuous patient engagement to a long history of successful community based participatory research to propose an innovative approach to PATient-centered    Involvement in Evaluating the effectiveNess of Treatments (PATIENTS). PATIENTS is designed to enhance existing UM infrastructure to: (1) Foster sustainable partnerships with local, regional, and national communities of diverse patients and healthcare systems to improve PCOR, investigators' cultural competency and, ultimately, health outcomes; (2) Conduct and expand PCOR in partnership with patients and healthcare delivery systems that will better inform patient-centered health care decision making and healthcare systems design; and (3) Advance dissemination and implementation strategies for PCOR findings for patients, health care providers, and healthcare systems to utilize evidence-based interventions. A major focus of PATIENTS will be to select health outcomes and comparator interventions that matter to diverse patients or their surrogates, address the applicability and feasibility of PCOR across healthcare systems, and accelerate adoption of effective interventions through implementation science.         The cornerstone of the PATIENTS program is UM, including the Baltimore (UMB) and College Park (UMCP) campuses, the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) and related clinics and hospitals within the UM network; however, it is the inclusion of diverse patient communities and healthcare systems into the infrastructure that will ensure meaningful stakeholder involvement. Four individual investigator research projects support the development of the PCOR infrastructure and add to the sustainability of partnerships."

We developed a comprehensive approach to temporality in the clinical text and innovated in computable temporal representations, methods for temporal relation discovery and their evaluation, rendering temporality to end users - resulting in over 35+ papers and presentations. Our dissemination is international and far-reaching as the best performing methods are released open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (ctakes.apache.org). The methods we developed are now being used in such nation-wide initiatives as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE), Pharmacogenomics Network (PGRN), Informatics for Integrating the Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute and National Cancer Institute's Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR). Through our participation in organizing major international bakeoffs - CLEF/ShARe 2014, SemEval 2014 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 7, SemEval 2015 Analysis of Clinical Text Task 14, SemEval 2015 Clinical TempEval Task 6 - we further disseminated the THYME resources and challenged the international research community to explore new solutions to the unsolved temporality task. Through all these activities it became clear that computational approaches to temporality still present great challenges and usability of the output is still limited. Therefore, we propose to further innovate on methodologies and end user experience.

"9145813","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gaucher's disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by recessively inherited mutations in the glucosidase, beta, acid (GBA1) gene, which encodes glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the sphingolipid glucosylceramide. GD encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, including severe and untreatable neurological abnormalities. Over the past ten years it has become increasingly clear that patients with GD also have a dramatically elevated risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), a common movement disorder characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the accumulation of intracellular neuronal protein aggregates known as Lewy bodies. More recently, this finding has led to the discovery that heterozygous mutations in GBA1 are the most common genetic association with PD and Lewy body dementia (LBD), possibly accounting for 7-10% of these diseases. The mechanisms by which GBA1 mutations cause neurological symptoms of GD, and increase the risk of PD and LBD, are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the neurological symptoms of GD derive from the lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide, and a consequent defect in the degradative capacity of the lysosome. We further hypothesize that mutations in GBA1 increase the risk for PD and LBD by impairing the lysosomal degradation of ?-synuclein protein, a major component of the Lewy body aggregates that define both of these diseases. Finally, we hypothesize that genetic modifiers largely account for the poor genotype-phenotype correlation observed in GD and the low penetrance of GBA1 mutations in PD and LBD. To explore these hypotheses, we have created a Drosophila model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency that exhibits shortened lifespan, locomotor and memory deficits, neurodegeneration, and accumulation of protein aggregates. We propose to use our Drosophila model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, as well as an existing mouse model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency, to pursue three aims. First, we will test the hypothesis that lysosomal glucosylceramide accumulation is responsible for the phenotypes of our Drosophila model of glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Second, we will test the hypothesis that glucocerebrosidase deficiency impairs lysosomal protein degradation, including the degradation of ?-synuclein. Third, we will conduct a genetic screen to identify novel modifiers of the phenotypes caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Our work will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of GD, PD and LBD, and this insight will facilitate risk assessment in the clinic and provide a foundation for the development of treatments."

As such, involving a few African Centers already involved in the forefront of Sickle Cell Disease Research in Africa with moderate expertise on psychosocial research (Cameroon), newborn screening (Ghana) or genomics studies (Tanzania) could serves as a reservoir for rigorous examination of a wide range of accompanying ethical, psychosocial, cultural, and policy issues.  While there is a moderate amount of speculation and some theoretical/conceptual literature about the perceptions, utility, and impact of genomic research and SCD-related public health strategies in Africa, little empirical data are available. Empirical data from a broad spectrum of stakeholders are essential to the development of effective policies and programs. A major objective of this pilot project is to advance our understanding of the perspectives of researchers, health professionals, and community populations within our collaborative network concerning both genomic research and the public health aspects of SCD. We will employ qualitative research methods to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Explore perspectives and attitudes regarding genomic research and its implementation and implications in Cameroon, Ghana and Tanzania. Aim 2: Assess perceptions about public health interventions to increase awareness, early detection, and prevention of SCD-related complications.  This research is the first phase of a series of longitudinal, mixed method studies exploring individual, family, community, and professional perspectives on genomic research and SCD-related public health interventions. This formative research will help us to define the most effective strategies for: 1) implementing genomic research and addressing the pertinent issues and 2) insuring informed decision-making about and optimal uptake of newborn screening, other public health interventions for SCD, and the related services."

"9356876","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kidney stones affect 1 in 11 Americans at an annual cost of $10B, with both numbers steadily climbing. Watchful waiting is the preferred approach to stone management, but there are no means to predict when the stone will pass or if the stone will pass. Intervention is typically recommended once a stone is over 5 mm and usually involves breaking the stone into smaller fragments, which are then expected to pass on their own. Multiple studies have shown that these residual fragments often do not pass on their own and lead to symptomatic stone events in up to 50%, and secondary surgery in 20%, of the 700,000 procedures performed yearly. A non-invasive tool that could facilitate stone fragment passage would significantly improve the management of kidney stones. Technology: Ultrasonic propulsion is a non-invasive tool to move stones within the collecting space using acoustic radiation force. The technology uses an existing commercial diagnostic probe so the stone movement can be monitored in real-time with imaging. The technology has the potential to aid in the passage of small stones and fragments in an office setting, improve stone free rates immediately following lithotripsy procedures, and relieve pain by moving a stone blocking the ureter. Preliminary Data: Investigational results from a feasibility trial has shown the technology to be safe and effective in humans with stone repositioning in 14 of 15 subjects and an aggregate 30 stone fragments passed by 4 of 6 post-lithotripsy subjects. Specific Aims: This is a Fast Track proposal that will use Phase 1 to test technical advances from which final design specifications will be formed for commercial prototype development in Phase 2. Phase 1 Aim 1 expands the capabilities of our technology, augmenting the Push pulse designed to move one stone at a time in order to collectively move a cluster of small stone fragments. A custom phantom model will be used to quantify improvement in the Push efficiency of a broadened beam relative to that of the existing narrow-beam system. The outcome will improve an operator's ability to clear the many small residual fragments found in post-lithotripsy subjects in a short timeframe. Phase 2 includes integrating imaging that tracks an acoustic signature unique to stones and assembling a focus group all to improve the usability of the system, porting the technology onto an FDA-approved, OEM, complete, urological ultrasound system, and performing the safety and effectiveness tests necessary for application for an investigational device exemption. The outcome of this proposal will be a clinical trial-ready, commercially viable ultrasonic propulsion and imaging system that can effectively treat post-lithotripsy stone fragments."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed NIDDK K01 award is to develop an independent research program that investigates environmental and behavioral approaches to mitigating multigenerational effects maternal obesity. The candidate is an obesity epidemiologist with strong expertise in environmental and behavioral influences on obesity in adolescents and adults, and a wide range of quantitative methods. The candidate has recent expertise in the perinatal period of the life course and fetal programming of obesity. The candidate's long-term goal is to contribute understanding of how biological susceptibilities programmed in early life interact with a complex system of behaviors and environments through the life course and through multiple generations. The proposed career development goals include gaining expertise in (1) placental biology and its linkages to fetal programming and (2) systems science. This expertise is necessary for innovative transdisciplinary research that integrates biological and epidemiological knowledge to investigate multigenerational obesity processes. This training will be supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship team composed of experts in chronic disease epidemiology (Fortmann; primary mentor), fetal programming and placentology (Thornburg), maternal-fetal medicine (Caughey), and systems science (Wakeland). The proposed research will develop a novel methodology for investigating the effects of maternal obesity over multiple generations. It overcomes the challenge that fetal programming is an inherently multigenerational phenomenon, yet multigenerational research in human populations is not feasible with traditional methods. It uses a complex system modeling technique - agent-based models - to integrate robust empirical data on fetal programming processes and multi-level influences on human behavior in a synthetic population. The model will account for the biological effects of maternal obesity on offspring obesity susceptibility, cumulative impacts of childhood behaviors on prenatal behaviors and health, and other complexities. We will (1) develop and validate the agent-based model, then use it to (2) determine the effects of fetal programming on population-wide and subgroup-specific obesity prevalence over four generations and (3) determine the effects of simulated diet and physical activity changes on population-wide obesity prevalence over four generations. This research will quantify how maternal obesity can induce a positive feedback loop of escalating obesity and provide the first assessment of optimal strategies that yield optimal long-term reductions in obesity prevalence within a complex system. Research and training activities will culminate in submission of R01 applications to investigate how fetal programming propagates multigenerational race/ethnic disparities in obesity-related health (agent-based model), and integration of placental metrics in an epidemiologic study of behavioral factors that remediate fetal programming alterations."
"9244324","ABSTRACT  Traumatic injuries are a significant public health issue, affecting citizens of all ages, genders, and races, and responsible for the most deaths in individuals 44 years and younger. While public health resources have begun to address emotional recovery after large scale disasters, little attention has been paid to the emotional recovery of non-disaster-related trauma patients, and less still to what previous patients feel they needed to know about emotional recovery at discharge. Few trauma centers routinely provide injured patients with psychological support or information at discharge from the hospital. Research with discharged trauma inpatients, including our recent pilot study of structured interviews, Whole Assessment of Trauma Recovery-1 (WATR-1), demonstrated higher rates of major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, and smoking when compared to the general public. Yet only a small percentage of those who considered seeking professional help for emotional and psychological distress (EPD) actually received help. Providing patient-centered awareness, education, and referral regarding emotional health, based on the experiences of previous trauma patients, could affect years of potential employment and social stability, as well as quality of life of the patients, and improve health care quality.  This project aims to identify what resources trauma patients need to improve their recovery after discharge, and how best to communicate this information to them. Semi-structured, open-ended telephone interviews with recently discharged patients will be conducted using a purposive sample to obtain a mix of demographic and injury characteristics, stratified by urban versus rural residence. These interviews will be used to create new discharge information for patients by: 1) Learning what discharged trauma inpatients experienced emotionally after discharge, 2) Soliciting recommendations from discharged trauma inpatients about peri-discharge information that may have been valuable in their emotional and mental health trajectory, and 3) Assessing modifiable barriers and facilitators to mental health care after discharge.  While the WATR-1 pilot study identified some post-discharge mental health needs, this research project would allow patients the freedom to voice what they believe they most need and how to provide it. The information learned will serve to both increase awareness of the post-discharge emotional needs of trauma patients, as well as to develop and implement patient-oriented discharge materials in user-friendly formats. The new discharge format may involve technology such as interactive smart phone applications for education and monitoring. Future research could then evaluate the ensuing patient outcomes in terms of mental health, quality of life, and return to function. By more completely assisting trauma patients in obtaining maximum function, this project could affect not only patient outcome, but that of their families and society."
"9232492","Abstract Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the number one cause of serious, long term disability. Of the nearly 800,000 annual strokes, approximately 25% will be recurrent events. Unfortunately, recurrent strokes are more deadly and most likely to cause disability when compared to a first stroke. Genetic studies focusing on recurrent stroke have been extremely limited. We have identified two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke and aim to use next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) to fine-map these regions to hone in on the likely causal variants. For 182 recurrent stroke patients from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) clinical trial, we will utilize NGS platforms to identify all genetic variants across 1.5 Mb spanning the two novel gene regions associated with recurrent stroke. High priority variants will be genotyped in all 2,100 VISP participants and analyzed for association with recurrent stroke. NGS is a cutting edge technology that provides a powerful approach to identify novel and important genetic contributors to recurrent stroke, a phenotype that has been poorly studied. This approach may allow improved personalization of risk assessment and targeted prevention. Moreover, VISP participants include both African Americans (AA) and European Americans, therefore this proposal may identify genetic risk variants specific to populations of African descent that might not otherwise be identified in other studies focused primarily on populations of European ancestry. These variants may help address why African Americans have nearly 2x greater risk of suffering a stroke, and are more likely to die following a stroke, as compared to European Americans. Furthermore, these findings may have broader implications by providing insight on other issues influencing recurrent stroke such as the ability to control manageable risk factors (e.g. hypertension and atrial fibrillation) and likewise one?s response to treatment for anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and antihypertensive medications. Moreover, these finding may reflect post stroke treatment response to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA approved treatment for ischemic stroke. Aligned with the goals of the NIH Academic Research Enhancement Award (AREA) Program (R15), we aim to explore a significant research question while exposing students to research, in particular learning cutting edge skills in Genomics, Population Genetics, Biotechnology techniques involving NGS library preparations, and Bioinformatics skills focused on analyzing NGS data and performing statistical analyses for genetic studies."
"9199973","A NEW HOLOGRAPHIC 3D CAMERA FOR FUNDUS IMAGING Abstract  In the United States, retinal disease is the most common cause of visual impairment, with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) being the most common retinal diseases. For each of the above conditions, high resolution and three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the retina, retinal vasculature, choroid and/or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is critical for diagnosis and research into the disease as well as for monitoring response to treatment. Pathology to any of these structures can lead to vision loss, since the health and function of the retina is dependent upon proper functioning of all of these components. An inexpensive and simple method to image all of these fundus structures at high resolution and in three dimensions would dramatically improve patient care and medical research.  The goal of this project is to apply Fresnel Incoherent Correlation Holography (FINCH) to human fundus imaging. FINCH is a self-referenced low-coherence holographic technique that can create super-resolved 3D holographic images from any light source, including fluorescent or reflected light from the human eye fundus. A FINCH-based fundus imaging system would improve resolution and 3D imaging capability of fundus photography and all types of fluorescence angiography for retinal vasculature, while also potentially providing depth and thickness maps of retinal layers in a mode similar to Optical Coherence Tomography. All this could be done in a single instrument with operational modes identical to fluorescence angiography and fundus photography. For this Phase I research program, the well-understood design principles of FINCH will be used to adapt a standard commercial fundus camera for FINCH imaging. The prototype FINCH fundus camera will be used to image lifelike eye tissue phantoms as well as human subjects in order to establish its efficacy in fundus imaging. The long term goal of this research is the construction of inexpensive turn-key FINCH camera units specially designed to interface with commercial fundus cameras, to enable greater availability of high-resolution 3D fundus imaging in clinical care and medical research."
"9235576","The Wise App Trial for Improving Health Outcomes in PLWH Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to affect 1.2 million Americans. Achieving viral suppression through adherence to antiretroviral (ART) therapy is a critical determinant of successful transmission prevention and long-term outcomes in HIV-infected patients. However only about 25% of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are virally suppressed, demonstrating the need for effective interventions that enhance ART adherence. mHealth is a tool that has proven useful in supporting behavior change, but most mHealth tools for PLWH have not been well-developed or evaluated. Given the dearth of useful and likeable apps, the need for improving medication adherence in PLWH, and the great promise of mHealth, we propose to build and test a user-centered smartphone app linked to a smart pill box targeting ART adherence in PLWH. Self- report of medication adherence is often criticized since it typically overestimated adherence especially in unmasked trials. Current adherence assessments, such as patient recall, pill counts and pharmacy refill data, typically detect missed doses long after they occur. Our study will use real-time, wireless monitoring strategies via the Wisepill dispenser, for measuring ART adherence. This will overcome this often cited limitation and provide novel opportunities to proactively prevent virologic rebound and treatment failure. Guided by Fogg's Functional Triad for persuasive technology and building on our earlier user-centered design work, the proposed intervention has the potential to not only improve ART adherence in PLWH, but also have a sustainable public health impact. The aims of our study are to: (1) Build a functional app for HIV self- management linked to a smart pill box (Wise App) for PLWH and assess its usability; (2) Evaluate the impact of the Wise App on medication adherence in underserved PLWH; and (3) Assess PLWH perceptions of the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors for Wise App use through theoretically-guided focus group sessions. The proposed study extends our preliminary work that employed user-centered design methods to identify the content, features, functionalities, and interface of a mobile app to improve health outcomes in PLWH. The user-centered design app we will build will then be linked to a smart pill box so that PLWH can receive feedback on their adherence behaviors. Our study intervention, the Wise App, is relevant, timely, of public health import, and supported by substantial preliminary work. The proposed trial is significant in representing a principled and systematic effort to build, and test the efficacy of a smartphone intervention for ART adherence in PLWH in the US. Importantly, this work has broader implications and will improve our understanding of how to support patients' medication adherence, regardless of treatment target."
"9143753","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The timely and effective evacuation of neonates during emergencies and disasters is an urgent priority identified by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services. Neonatal intensive care units provide unique challenges during hospital emergencies requiring evacuation. Training and education of healthcare providers in this environment around best practices to maintain safe, medical care for these critically ill infants are limited but the need is great. One potential innovative method to provide emergency evacuation education and training to healthcare workers is through the use of virtual reality simulation (VRS). Given the paucity of research and evidence pertaining to disaster evacuation of neonates, this proposed study will greatly expand an extremely neglected area. The purpose of this study is to examine differences in learning outcomes among healthcare workers who undergo VRS emergency evacuation training of NICU to those who receive web-based alone. Learning outcomes include a) knowledge gained and retention post VRS compared with traditional learning techniques, b) confidence with evacuation procedures involving infants, and c) psychomotor learning based upon performance in a live evacuation drill. Healthcare worker experiences with VRS will also be explored quantitatively and qualitatively to determine immersiveness, reality, and ability to navigate scenarios. A longitudinal, repeated measures, randomized-experimental design will be instituted with a convenience sample of 90 healthcare workers randomly assigned to the VRS training and web-based modules (45) versus a control group (45) that receives the web-based modules alone. Five VRS scenarios will be created that augment neonate evacuation training materials presented in the web-based modules. Learning will be measured using cognitive assessment, self-efficacy questionnaire and performance in a live drill. Data will be collected at baseline, post, 6, and 12 months and analyzed using generalized estimating equations analysis within a generalized linear model framework. For the qualitative component involving participants' perceptions of the VRS scenarios, content analysis of focus group data will be performed with identification and verification of themes. Results from this study will expand the evidence pertaining to training of healthcare workers as provide evacuation of neonates during a disaster."

PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Partnership between the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC), Tuskegee University (TU), and Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) presents a unique opportunity to build on our successful accomplishments in training and education of the pipeline of future cancer research scientists, with emphasis on underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities. For this U54 application, we propose a seamless integration of our cancer education programs by focusing on ?hard? (structured courses/training developed through previous U54 funding) and ?soft? skills (e.g., career development roadmap, interviewing skills) needed to facilitate movement through our pipeline into the cancer research continuum, with the goal of having a diverse workforce well-prepared to address cancer health disparities and ?meet the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs,? as outlined in the RFA. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: (1) To develop and implement an integrated cancer research education program that links underrepresented undergraduate and graduate/medical students with post-doctoral fellows, medical residents, junior faculty investigators, and senior level researchers through four integrated programs: (a) the Cancer Research Immersion Student Program (CRISP) for undergraduate students; (b) the Summer Cancer Research Education Program (SCREP) and Cancer Research Certificate Program (CRCP) for graduate and medical students; (c) the Health Disparities Research Education Program (HDREP) for postdoctoral fellows and medical residents as well as integration of undergraduate/graduate/medical students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty into multidisciplinary research teams; and (d) the Transitional Pathway Program (TPP) that will facilitate the movement of undergraduate to graduate students, graduate/medical students to residents, postdoctoral fellows and/or junior faculty, and junior faculty to established researchers in cancer disparities. (2) To link cancer research scholars (undergraduate and graduate/medical students, medical residents, post- doctoral fellows, and junior faculty) with the Outreach Core to share their research findings with community members and obtain community feedback (e.g., Cancer Info Cafés) and to develop publications and communications for lay audiences (e.g., blogs or posts on social media, YouTube videos, policy briefs); and (3) To implement a mixed-method, triangulated evaluation of CRISP, SCREP, CRCP, HDREP, and TPP."
"9144342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today, patients and providers are presented with more health care options than ever before. There is considerable doubt and lack of understanding of science not only among patients, but also among physicians. Without systematic, evidence-based guidance for the appropriate and efficient use of the multitude of treatment options, as well as the consideration of patient preferences, the rapid growth and complexity of treatments will only add to the existing confusion about which option is best for each individual patient.        The objective of the proposed Patient-Centered Outcome Research Center (PCORC) is to fully leverage and further develop the research Infrastructure and clinical assets of Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in order to conduct Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR). The PCOR evidence will guide care in order to achieve patient-desired outcomes in our urban and suburban patient populations located throughout Metropolitan Detroit. The Center will be organized into four different Cores (Patient Engagement Core, Study Design and Analysis/Measurement Core, Patient Data Network Core, and Implementation/Dissemination Core) with different functions. The Center currently has three PCOR projects proposed that are focused on our selected theme of caring for the obese patient. The HFHS PCORC will maximize programmatic and scientific efficiency within our health care system setting, promote shared use of resources and standardization of processes and procedures, promote training in PCOR/Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) methods, and facilitate rapid dissemination of research findings to the medical community and translation of those results into our system's clinical practice.        The Center will bliild on existing research capabilities by developing expertise in novel PCOR methods    through didactic course work, educational sessions at national meetings and content-specific educational seminars. These educational experiences will allow the Center staff to learn how to develop and conduct innovative PCOR studies that will provide evidence for the many pressing issues in patient care. The Center wiil demonstrate its proficiency through the conduct of the proposed proiects."
"9219722","SUMMARY The human enteric nervous system (ENS) is a complex network of ~500 million neurons derived from the enteric neural crest (ENC) and essential for gastro-intestinal (GI) function. ENS defects are the cause of many common human disorders including gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a severe congenital defect characterized by the lack of ENS precursors in the distal portions of the gut referred to as aganglionosis. Aganglionosis results in the lack of proper peristalsis causing functional colonic obstruction (megacolon)  Development of the human ENS is poorly understood given the lack of accessible tissue. The use of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent an novel and unique strategy to access human ENS development and to model and potentially treat HD. Very recent work from our group demonstrates the feasibility of generating ENC from human PSCs and sets the stage for using the technology for developing drug and cell based strategies in treating HD and potentially other ENS disorders. The current application builds on such exciting preliminary work to pursue three specific aims: In Aim 1, we will establish conditions to characterize and manipulate the broad repertory of neuronal subtypes and enteric glia from hPSCs and to test their function in innovative co-culture assays with known target cells. In Aim 2, we will apply ENC differentiation technology to model HD in hPSCs and to validate current and identify novel candidate HD drugs. In Aim 3, we will optimize hPSC-based cell therapy approaches in a mouse model of HD and perform mechanistic studies that define the critical parameters for in vivo rescue of HD animals. Our study is unique as it represents the first effort to reliably recreate and study early human ENS lineages in vitro. The collaborators assembled for this proposal have complementary expertise in hPSCs, ENS biology, chemical screening and cell transplantation. The ENS is a structure that is not sufficiently studied by others despite its important contribution to human health. Our study has the potential to directly yield novel drug and cell based treatments for HD. The work sets the stage and develops the technology necessary for the broader community to study ENS development and ENS function in human health and disease."
"9201754","Abstract An effective bullying prevention program or strategy is one that incorporates evidence on protective factors at multiple levels including: healthy self-esteem among youth; positive student-teacher interactions; normative beliefs that sanction rather than endorse bullying; and a school climate based on fairness and trust (Guerra et al., 2011). Nationally, 20% of students have been bullied on school property (CDC, 2012). Research studies have demonstrated that bullying prevention implementation is mediated by teacher factors (e.g., self-efficacy, perceived topic relevance, job stress, experience); school factors (e.g., leadership structure); program factors (e.g., appropriate goals and teaching pedagogy) and student factors (e.g., behaviors) (Kealey et. al., 2000; Showers et al., 1987; Zhai et al., 2011). Although teachers are ?front line? providers in bullying prevention, the availability of teacher training and capacity building courses is ?woefully inadequate? (Smith, 2011). Teachers often do not have access to reliable resources to their anti-bullying efforts; and little guidance for how to implement effective strategies fit to their specific contexts and students (Domitrovich et al., 2008; Espelage & Swearer, 2008). The proposed Teen-created Online Tolerance and Anti-bullying Library (TOTAL) will offer teachers an innovative multimedia resource providing information about effective bullying prevention programs and best practices; as well as how to deliver prevention efforts employing active and meaningful youth engagement. In Year 1 we will complete development of a modular online resource that refocuses bullying prevention from negative deficient models to a positive youth development model inspired by Social and Emotional Learning principles. TOTAL will include:  ? a comprehensive resource housing in one place evidence-based bullying prevention programs with common effectiveness criteria and implementation information;  ?youth engagement core competencies for teachers to respond to bullying and engage with teens in meaningful ways;  ? youth-created off-the-shelf activities to help foster this engagement; and  ? tools and strategies to increase teachers' self-efficacy to implement and sustain effective bullying prevention efforts. A two-arm quasi-experimental outcome study will be conducted in Year 2 to test the effectiveness of the new TOTAL resource."
"9054451","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image representation in primary visual cortex depends critically on the spatiotemporal pattern of convergence of lateral geniculate axons as well as on the dynamic properties of thalamocortical synapses. Thalamic input represents only a fraction of the excitatory drive to cortical cells in layer 4, but dominates their visual response patterns. We will use electrophysiological methods in vivo to record visual responses simultaneously from thalamorecipient neurons in primary visual cortex and several of their input cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that simple cells in  layer 4 have a larger spatiotemporal footprint of input inhibition than excitation. In Aim 2, we wil characterize the properties of the postsynaptic potentials from single LGN neurons onto excitatory and inhibitory simple cells in layer 4. We will also study their dynamic properties such  as short term plasticity and synaptic integration from multiple LGN cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we wil use dynamic clamp in layer 4 simple cells to study convergent input from combinations of single LGN neurons (using knowledge obtained in Aims 1 and 2) without concomitant activation of cortical circuits. We will estimate the relative contributions of synchronous LGN input and local inhibition in establishing L4 simple cell visual responses. These studies will generate critical insight into the transformation of visual information that takes place in the thalamocortical synapse."
"9144715","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2) is to perform a pragmatic and efficient replication of TACT1 in patients with diabetes and a prior heart attack. The results of this trial will determine whether disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) chelation therapy receives approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is subsequently accepted to reduce the risk of major adverse events from coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes. TACT2, if positive, will also promote research into the mechanism(s) of benefits and provide novel insights into the pathobiology of CAD. The Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT1) was developed in response to a Request for Applications from NCCAM and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to address the concern that chelation use was widespread but there were no reliable data on either safety or efficacy. Surprisingly to cardiologists, the chelation strategy,  combination of up to 40 infusions with intravenous disodium EDTA plus oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) compared with intravenous and oral placebo, led to a significant reduction in the time to first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), age 50 or older, already treated with standard evidence based medical therapies (HR 0.74; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.57- 0.95; p=0.016. The 5-year number needed to treat (NNT) was 12. In the prespecified subgroup with diabetes (n=633), the results were dramatic: the chelation-based strategy reduced the composite primary clinical endpoint by 51% (HR 0.49, 95%CI (0.33 0.75); p<0.001, 5-year NNT 5.5) and reduced total mortality by 43% (p=0.011, 5-year NNT 12). As a result of these findings, and because of the public health impact of cardiovascular disease and of diabetes, we have been encouraged by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA to confirm the results of TACT1. The three Specific Aims of TACT2 are: 1) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves event-free survival; 2) To determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces mortality; 3) To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy. TACT2 will enroll 1200 diabetic patients 50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. Patients will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either chelation + OMVM or double placebo and followed for clinical events until the end of the 5 year trial. The primary endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for unstable angina. A Clinical Events Committee masked to treatment assignment will adjudicate events. Principal secondary endpoints will include: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) a composite of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent MI, or stroke; and (3) safety."
"9320064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thrombotic complications such as cardiovascular diseases and stroke are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in our aging population. Despite the strong clinical association between aging and thrombosis, the mechanisms of thrombosis in the elderly are not well understood. In a recent study we demonstrated that aged mice display increased susceptibility to thrombosis. Our findings also revealed that aged mice develop increased intra-platelet hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and platelet hyperactivity (increased integrin aIIbß3 activation). Importantly, genetic approaches to eliminate H2O2 prevented platelet hyperactivity in aged mice, suggesting that H2O2 is a critical mediator. Importantly, our pilot studies in human subjects demonstrate that platelets from aged humans exhibit peroxide mediated hyperactivity The objectives of this application are to identify the upstream mechanism leading to accumulation of H2O2 in platelets and to determine whether prevention of H2O2-mediated platelet hyperactivity decreases aging-associated increased thrombotic susceptibility. Our central hypothesis is that aging results in increased arterial and venous thrombotic susceptibility via enhanced platelet activation in a pathway that includes generation of superoxide by a Nox2- containing NADPH oxidase, followed by conversion of superoxide to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1), leading to H2O2-induced enhancement of platelet activation. The rationale for this hypothesis is that Nox2- containing NADPH oxidase is the major source of platelet reactive oxygen species, and our recent study demonstrated upregulation of NADPH oxidase and SOD1 in platelets from aged mice. Aim 1 will determine the mechanistic roles of NADPH oxidase and SOD1 in platelet hyperactivation in aging. Aim 2 will determine whether inhibition of H2O2-mediated platelet hyperactivity is sufficient to decrease thrombotic susceptibility with aging. Studies will utilize a novel mouse model in which endogenous platelets are immunodepleted prior to transfer of platelets from aged or young mice, allowing assessment of the effects of donor platelets on arterial occlusion and venous thrombosis in the absence of potential confounding effects of host platelets. Aim 3 will evaluate hyperactivity of platelets from aged humans and its thrombotic consequences. Understanding the mechanism by which platelet activation with aging contributes to thrombotic susceptibility has the potential to reveal new therapeutic strategies to minimize vascular decline in the elderly."
"9304604","Hospital care accounts for more than 40% of all pediatric healthcare expenditures in the United States, representing approximately 2 million pediatric hospitalizations annually. Lacking rigorously developed and tested measures for this setting, the quality of hospital care for children is not well understood. Hosptial-to- home care transitions and hospital-based mental healthcare are key topics representing gap areas for quality assessment and improvement in pediatrics. The overall goal of this study is to disseminate and test two new quality measure sets: the Transitions of Care Measure Set and the Mental Healthcare in Hospital Settings Measure Set in order to enhance the number of quality measures available to assess and improve pediatric hospital-based care. We will implement these measure sets in eight hospitals serving children and in four state Medicaid agencies in order to understand their validity in predicting better outcomes, their reliability in distinguishing between poor and excellent care, their feasibility of implementation in a variety of healthcare settings, and their usability for quality improvement (QI) and accountability purposes.  The specific aims of the study are: 1) To disseminate and implement the Transitions of Care and Mental healthcare in Hospital Settings measures sets in eight hospitals nationally to examine a) feasibility of tool implementation, b) quality measure validity, and c) quality measures reliability in a variety of healthcare settings, 2) To identify one quality measure from each measure set as a target for QI collaborative intervention by evaluating variation in baseline performance on individual measures within each set across the eight hospitals, 3) To improve overall performance by 50% on the two targeted measures by the end of the QI collaborative and to assess whether better performance is associated with improved outcomes, and 4) To assess the responsiveness of both a) the measures targeted for QI intervention and b) the full measure sets to the QI collaborative interventions.  We will accomplish these aims by bringing together a multidisciplinary, multi-stakeholder team of experts representing state Medicaid agencies from three states, an External Quality Review Organization, eight hospitals serving children insured by Medicaid or the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP), experts in quality measurement, dissemination and implementation science, conducting hospital-based QI collaboratives, and academic researchers."
"9166324","ABSTRACT Since the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells, a major goal for regenerative medicine has been to replace damaged or diseased tissues with patient-derived cells. In principle, it should be possible to generate functional tissues for clinical use through directed differentiation protocols that specifically alter the fate of pluripotent cells. Unfortunately, there are many challenges associated with directed differentiation. First, we do not fully understand all of the signaling mechanisms that participate in developmental regulatory pathways. We therefore cannot always identify the correct combination of molecular factors that will recapitulate these signals in a laboratory setting. Even if the required factors are known, it is unclear what doses, timing, or combinations of factors will produce an efficient differentiation. Most protocols are developed by trial-and-error; take years to optimize; and lead to incomplete, inefficient, or heterogeneous mixtures of the desired cell types. Clearly, there is a critical need for improving differentiation procedures if we expect to produce realistic cell-based therapies. In this essay, I propose a novel solution for controlling the fate of human stem cells. The approach, which we have pioneered in our lab, works by allowing a computational model to design the differentiation protocol. To build the model, we use time-lapse microscopy to monitor the expression of key developmental markers over the time course of differentiation. These data provide a mechanistic description of cellular fate decisions at single-cell resolution. To train the model, we then apply a series of systematic perturbations to differentiating cells, monitor the cells by live-cell microscopy, and integrate these new measurements into the working model. Finally, we use the model as a predictive tool by performing thousands of virtual experiments to identify a set of perturbations that are predicted to alter stem cell fate in a prescribed way. Model predictions are validated through single-cell transcription profiling, and these data are used to iteratively refine the model?s predictive power. As proof of principle, we will use this approach to produce precise combinations of human lung progenitor cells that could be used to treat pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, or interstitial lung disease. In the near term, our approach will enable us to manipulate pluripotent cells to acquire a precise combination of differentiated cell fates?overcoming a major hurdle in stem cell therapy. In the long term, this approach could be used more generally to control the fate of other cell types including bacteria or cancer cells, and may help to design improved drug delivery protocols."

Aim 4: Provide genomic decision support by enhancing and validating our clinical and informatics infrastructure for genomic decision support with learning mechanisms for tailored shared decision-making."
"9249713","Project Summary/Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is important, as therapeutic interventions such as amyloid immunization are thought to be most beneficial at this stage of the disease. Therefore, the emphasis in AD research is shifting toward understanding the process by which high-risk elderly individuals begin to develop brain abnormality, at a time when they are still cognitively normal. Apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE4) is the largest known genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer?s disease. Carriers of APOE4 gene have between 10 and 30 times the risk of developing AD, as compared to those not carrying APOE4. Therefore, understanding neurobiological differences between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers will have a significant benefit in this high-risk population and will also help elucidate early AD mechanisms in general.  Brain metabolism has been hypothesized as one of the earliest imaging markers of AD in the recent consensus model. To date, brain metabolism in AD is primarily measured with Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. However, the presence of ionizing radiation and the lack of absolute quantification make the technique less frequently used in studies of cognitively normal subjects. Our laboratory has recently developed and validated a technique to measure the brain?s oxygen extraction fraction and metabolism with MRI. The technique does not require any exogenous tracer, can be completed within five minutes on a standard 3T, has a high test- retest reproducibility, and has recently been evaluated in a multi-site setting. This project represents the first application of this novel technique in prodromal AD. The central hypothesis of this project that elderly individuals with high risk to develop AD, e.g. APOE4 carriers, will show abnormal brain metabolic features, at an early time when their cognition is still normal.  We have a cost-effective, time-limited window of opportunity to test this hypothesis, by leveraging rich resources of the NIH-funded ?Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Dementia (BIOCARD)? study. The BIOCARD Study is a longitudinal, observational study of 278 elderly individuals. We have obtained approval from the BIOCARD study to include the brain metabolism sequences in the MRI protocol, and the preliminary studies have shown a potential effect of APOE4. Therefore, we are in a unique position to thoroughly examine the role of imaging markers in the onset of neurodegeneration in high-risk individuals. Our Specific Aims are 1) Examine the relationship between brain oxygen metabolic markers and APOE4 in cognitively normal elderly individuals; 2) Investigate whether the association between high AD risk and aberrant brain metabolism can be extended to other risk factors such as tauopathy and amyloid protein.  Impact: The impact of this work is that we will establish an early biomarker to detect neurodegeneration in individuals with a high risk to develop Alzheimer?s disease, at a time when they are still cognitively normal and when intervention may be most effective."

"9127725","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9128416","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes burden and disparities require the adoption, dissemination and implementation of evidence-based strategies involving both clinical and community partners in alignment with a consistent set of goals that are advanced by multi-sector stakeholders, including front-line public  health agencies, federal agencies, health providers and payors. The proposed application seeks to establish an innovative public-private partnership between the currently funded New York University (NYU) Prevention Research Center (PRC) and the City University of New York School of Public Health (CUNY SPH) that leverages existing collaborations in public health practice and research collaborations between partner institutions and their local, state, and federal public health agencies. The proposed NYU- CUNY PRC focuses on improving the health of communities at risk for CVD disparities through the adoption, dissemination and implementation of integrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies to advance goals of the Million Hearts Initiative. Our focus will be on Asian and Hispanic American communities, which share commonalities related to immigration, migration, acculturation, language access, and cultural diversity. For the Core Research Project, the NYU-CUNY PRC is partnering with a large health plan to test integrated combinations of community health worker (CHW) models and electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical interventions for CVD prevention in South Asian communities, with an aim.to advance implementation of the Million Hearts Initiative. PRC research activities align with CDC strategic priorities of disseminating health systems interventions to improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and preventive services and improve community-clinical linkages. In addition, the PRC efforts will support efforts to improve physical activity and nutrition, a core component of the Million Hearts Initiatie and a CDC-defined winnable battle. The PRC also aligns with EHR intervention efforts by local and state public health agencies and incorporates a population health surveillance perspective. PRC activities will contribute to understanding of how best to reduce CVD health disparities in Asian and Latino American communities through research, community engagement and training involving the full range of public health practitioners, community partners, academic researchers, and students of public health and medicine. The NYU-CUNY PRC application harnesses the vast breadth of population health resources and expertise across NYC and builds upon the partner institutions' rich foundation of community engagement and strong governmental linkages to address cardiovascular prevention among diverse Asian and Hispanic communities."
"9123686","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The tightly controlled chemical environment of the CNS required for proper synaptic transmission is maintained by the 'blood brain barrier' (BBB), which is composed of highly specialized blood vessels whose endothelial cells act as a physiological barrier to seal the CNS and control substance influx and efflux. Two unique features of CNS endothelial cells determine BBB integrity, namely specialized tight junctions between the endothelial cells lining the CNS capillaries and extremely low rates of vesicular trafficking between the luminal and abluminal plasma membranes, a process termed transcytosis. A solid understanding of how BBB function is regulated to ensure brain homeostasis is missing in the field, as there are little to no molecular insights into how CNS endothelial cells acquire and maintain their specialized properties. Furthermore, the most promising strategies for delivering therapeutic agents across the BBB involve the manipulation of transcytotic pathways, an avenue of research which requires mechanistic understanding of how this process is normally regulated. Previous work in our lab has identified MFSD2A as the first molecule to maintain BBB integrity specifically by suppressing transcytosis. MFSD2A is exclusively expressed in CNS endothelial cells, and genetic ablation of Mfsd2a results in both extravasation of exogenous tracer from the vessel lumen to brain parenchyma and an increased density of vesicles within CNS endothelial cells, while intercellular tight junctions remain normal The goal of this study is to understand the molecular mechanism whereby MFSD2A suppresses transcytosis. My preliminary data show that MFSD2A is localized to the luminal plasma membrane of CNS endothelial cells and that loss of Mfsd2a results in increased immunoreactivity of Cav-1. Therefore, I hypothesize that MFSD2A acts as a suppressor of caveolae-mediated transcytosis in CNS endothelial cells, possibly by interacting with transcytotic machinery to inhibit caveolae dynamics at the luminal plasma membrane. To this end, I have developed a rigorous experimental plan with three aims: I will (1) use in vivo tools and an in vitro cell-based system I have developed to determine which specific transcytotic pathway is suppressed by MFSD2A in CNS endothelial cells, (2) perform structure-function experiments to dissect how structural domains of MFSD2A contribute to its function in suppressing transcytosis, and (3) test the hypothesis that MFSD2A interacts with well-known molecular determinants of caveolae-mediated transcytosis to elicit its function. I expect that these experiments will provide novel insight into how BBB function is regulated, leading to new pathways for BBB manipulation for therapeutic purposes."
"9122980","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to map the organization of human white matter (WM) with cutting-edge ex vivo imaging technologies. This work will produce microscopic-level information on several long-range WM projections, as well as a more targeted mapping of circuits that serve the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These circuits are of particular interest in psychiatric applications but they have been heretofore mapped extensively only in non-human primates. Specifically, recent work with tracer injection studies in macaque monkeys has established how small fiber bundles that originate in different areas of the PFC reach their destinations by using the large WM pathways, such as the cingulum bundle (CB), corpus callosum (CC) and uncinate fasciculus (UF), as their conduits. For example, the UF is composed of several sub-bundles: some that follow the entire trajectory of the UF and others that join the UF only for part of its trajectory to then jump off and join other large pathways, like the CB, CC, etc. Mapping these distinct components of larger WM pathways in the human brain is challenging both in vivo and ex vivo. Invasive injection studies are not applicable to humans and conventional 2D histological techniques like myelin staining cannot be used to infer the 3D orientation of axon bundles. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide estimates of these orientations indirectly, by measuring the diffusion of water molecules through the WM. However, it is prone to errors in areas of complex WM architecture and requires validation by an independent source of measurements. In this work we will combine high-resolution, high-SNR ex vivo dMRI with polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) in post mortem human brains to extract microscopic information on WM areas that confound conventional dMRI, and to perform a detailed mapping of the projections of the PFC. We will take advantage of the MGH Connectom scanner, a unique instrument that can achieve 8 times stronger diffusion-encoding gradients than routine scanners, and was designed specifically for high-SNR, high-resolution dMRI. We will develop a specialized receive coil array for imaging ex vivo human brains on the Connectom scanner, which will allow us to collect whole-brain dMRI data with unprecedented resolution and SNR. The gold-standard dMRI and PS-OCT data produced by this work will be used to construct a novel atlas of WM anatomy, which will be incorporated in a tool for automated global probabilistic tractography, building on prior work by the PI. This tool will allow both the new, detailed taxonomy of smaller WM bundles, as well as the classical definitions of large WM pathways, to be reconstructed automatically from routine-quality in vivo dMRI data that can be collected on conventional scanners. The proposed work promises to advance our understanding of the organization of human neurocircuitry; to move human dMRI studies from the current view of a WM pathway as a single bundle to one where multiple smaller bundles merge on and off a pathway at different parts along its trajectory; and to provide the tools for studying this detailed WM taxonomy using routine neuroimaging data."
"9259018","Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiac optogenetics is an emerging technology with significant promise for the treatment of heart disease. Optogenetic actuators are ion channels or pumps that can be regulated by light, thus permitting the control of cellular electrical activity with high spatial and temporal precision. Optogenetics can be used not only to elucidate the electrical and mechanical functions of cardiac cells and heart tissue, but to potentially restore or repair malfunctioning pacemaker and conduction tissue. Unlike electrical implantable pacemakers, optogenetic actuators may permit optical modulation of electrical activity of cardiac pacemaker and conduction cells. Thus, this technology holds untapped potential for therapeutic applications. Significant hurdles must be overcome before this technology can be applied to human patients. The majority of optogenetic actuators operate in the 450-600 nm range, and light at these wavelengths is strongly scattered by cardiac tissue and absorbed by hemoglobin. These effects severely limit the tissue depth at which currently available optogenetic actuators can be used, thereby restricting their in vivo use to small rodents. To overcome this barrier, the use of longer- wavelength opsins has recently been suggested for optogenetics. The newest red-shifted opsins can operate at considerably greater tissue depths than conventional blue-sensitive channel-rhodopsins. Yet, even the most red-shifted opsins have significant overlap with the absorption spectrum of hemoglobin. Thus, an approach that could extend the operative range of actuators into the near-infrared (> 700 nm; i.e., beyond the hemoglobin absorption window) would be a major advance. The goal of this project is to co-express optogenetic actuators with a newly discovered enzyme, Cyp27c1, that can extend the spectral range of existing red-shifted optogenetic actuators into the near-infrared, thereby permitting optogenetic applications in the human heart. Cyp27c1 is used by fish and amphibians to extend their vision into the near-infrared in murky freshwater environments. The enzyme mediates this red-shift by adding an additional conjugated double bond to the visual chromophore, 11-cis retinal. The Corbo lab has demonstrated that Cyp27c1 can similarly act upon all-trans retinal, the chromophore of optogenetic actuators, to produce 3,4-didehydroretinal. Furthermore, a recent study showed that in vitro substitution of retinal with 3,4-didehydroretinal in optogenetic actuators can red-shift the actuator's action spectrum, underscoring the value of developing an in vivo strategy for cardiac applications."
"9319993","Emory and Georgia Tech have steadily grown the number of faculty involved in computational neuroscience  over the past 15 years. The research of these faculty stretch from cellular to systems and theoretical  approaches. In 1997 the two Institutions formed a joint Department of Biomedical Engineering, further  strengthening the highly collaborative atmosphere between researchers on both campuses. In addition both  campuses have a strong track record both in undergraduate and graduate teaching. The proposed training  program in computational neuroscience aims to capitalize on these strengths by formalizing an integrated  approach to class work and research on both undergraduate and graduate levels. The strong NIH and NSF  funded research programs of more than 15 principal investigators identified as computational neuroscientists  range from detailed cellular computer simulations of neural dynamics to engineering approaches and the  quantitative study of disease mechanisms underlying important disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson's  disease using computational methods. Therefore students will be exposed to multiple levels of approaches  aimed ultimately at addressing medical questions. A highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for student  fellowships under this program exists on both undergraduate and graduate levels, and will bring some  applicants with a primarily background in the biological sciences to integrate computational approaches into  their research, and vice versa brings more computational or theoretically oriented applicants in touch with  biological experimental research. The program encompasses a cohort of 6 undergraduate and 6 graduate  student fellows, who will absolve a rigorous curriculum in neurobiology and mathematical and computational  methods through a core sequence of required classes as well as individually chosen electives. Undergraduate  fellows will be funded for a period of two years in their junior and senior years, during which they will undertake  specialized class work and research in a computational neuroscience lab. Undergraduate trainees will be  primarily recruited from the Emory Neuroscience and Behavioral Biology and the Georgia Tech Biomedical  Engineering majors, who bring a biological and quantitative strength to the program, respectively. Over 200  students join these majors annually, and we will only take applicants with a GPA of 3.5 or better and  expressing an interest in future research graduate training. The graduate students in this program will be  recruited from the applicant pools for the Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering programs, which together  receive more than 120 highly qualified applications each year. A special track for fellows in computational  neuroscience will be announced on the program websites, that will also link to an extensive independent  website describing this program. Graduate students will be funded for the first two years of their education,  and then obtain individual training grants or be funded by research grants."
"9231108","Abstract Electronic cigarettes (EC) have gained significant popularity in the US since their introduction on the market eight years ago. Currently, ECs are not regulated by the FDA, partly because their effects on health have not been well characterized. Although ECs do not produce smoke and their users are not exposed to tar and carbon monoxide, they like other tobacco products deliver nicotine, which is the primary addictive component of tobacco. Nicotine has been shown to promote atherosclerosis by generating systemic oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation and atherosclerotic plaque formation, induce endothelial dysfunction and disrupt the integrity of vascular endothelial cells. This knowledge allows us to postulate that ECs may contribute to adverse cardiovascular health outcomes and should be regulated like traditional cigarettes (TC). Our long-term goal is to elucidate the effects of EC on vascular health, thereby providing scientific evidence for regulatory decisions contemplated by the Center for Tobacco Control. The objective of this proposal is to establish acute and chronic effects of EC use on systemic and local markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Our central hypothesis is that EC use promotes cardiovascular disease by increasing systemic oxidative stress and endothelial toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims. Aim 1: To characterize the effects of chronic e-cigarette smoking on systemic oxidative stress. The working hypothesis for this aim is that the EC use is associated with an increase in systemic oxidative stress. To attain this Aim, we will measure the validated and sensitive markers of oxidative stress: plasma and urinary levels of F2-isoprostanes, in nonsmokers, chronic EC users, TC smokers as positive controls. Aim 2: To determine the acute effects of e-cigarette smoking on endothelial cell integrity. The working hypothesis for this aim is that the use of e- cigarettes leads to endothelial injury resulting in an increase in the number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). We will measure the levels of EPC and their colony-forming units in EC users and TC smokers immediately before and after smoking a cigarette or EC use using nonsmokers as controls. Aim 3: To identify the effects of chronic e-cigarette usage on endothelial function. The working hypothesis for this aim is that the EC use is linked to a reduction in eNOS activity and at the same time an increase in markers of vascular inflammation, such as NF-kB. Using a minimally-invasive technique of endothelial biopsy, we will test our hypothesis by comparing the brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation measurements and the production of NF- kB and eNOS expression by the endothelial cells harvested from the veins of EC users and control non- smoker subjects including TC smokers as positive controls. Expected outcomes will provide immediate information on the likeliest harmful effects on ECs and help guide the FDA policymaking regarding EC safety."
"9172204","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive and incurable pediatric brain tumor that remains understudied. No progress in treatment has been made in the past 30 years, and radiation remains the standard of care.  Recent whole-genome sequencing on tumor samples revealed heterozygous lysine-to-methionine mutations of histone variant H3.3 at amino acid residue 27(K27M) in 80% of patients. We and others have shown that K27M invokes a gain-of-function mutation which inhibits the histone methyltransferase EZH2. This inhibition causes an overall global loss of the H3K27me3 mark as well as a restructuring of the residual H3K27me3 landscape. Chromatin immunopreciptiation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of human tumors with or without K27M mutations revealed the Cdkn2a transcript variant p16 as a target of increased H3K27me3.  Expression analysis of our murine H3.3K27M glioma model recapitulated these results and additionally revealed hoxa4, 5, and 7 among the most significantly downregulated genes.  Since the tumor suppressor p16 is mutated in several cancers but rarely appears in DIPG, we hypothesize K27M mutations drive tumorgenesis in part by epigenetically silencing this locus.  Alteration of the hox locus has been implicated in DIPG due to its role during brainstem development.  Our results suggest K27M mutation inhibits differentiation of brainstem progenitors by repressing these genes. To investigate these hypotheses I propose to characterize the H3K27me3 landscape at the Cdkn2a and Hoxa loci in our murine H3.3K27M glioma model.  Additionally, I will take advantage of our conditional Cdkn2a floxed model to determine the relationship between H3.3K27M mutant expression and the p16 tumor suppressor pathway with regard to oncogenic transformation.  The goal of this project is to determine how mutant H3.3K27M drives tumorigenesis by manipulating the epigenome to repress the p16 and Hoxa genes.  The repression of H3K27me3 at these sites may be enhancing cell cycle progression and maintaining a primitive progenitor-like state and targeting these genes with chemotherapeutics could lead to a more efficacious treatment."
"9136709","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The primary aim of this 6-site prospective cohort study is to develop algorithms usable in the clinical setting that predict decompressive laminectomy (DL) outcomes (i.e., success vs. failure) in older adults with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), the most common indication for spine surgery in older patients. The clinical algorithms developed will be based primarily on factors outside of LSS that are important aging-related predictors of pain and disability (e.g., hip osteoarthritis [OA], fibromyalgia syndrome, depression, anxiety, fear-avoidance beliefs, dysfunctional coping). Preliminary data support the impact of some of these factors on DL outcomes, but no study has included comprehensive assessment of rigorously collected data in the context of a prospective cohort. Thus LSS treatment remains focused exclusively on the lumbar spine and treatment outcomes suboptimal with, on average, < 20% reduction in pain. An estimated one in three DL patients does not improve at all. Further, anatomical evidence of LSS (i.e., based on advanced imaging) exists in many older patients without pain or functional compromise. Two hundred fifty patients with symptomatic LSS scheduled to undergo DL without fusion and who have no dementia, spinal instability, or prior lumbar surgery will be recruited from spine surgery practice at each of the 6 participating sites (VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Durham VA Medical Center [MC], Richmond VAMC, Ann Arbor VAMC, Denver VAMC, San Antonio VAMC). Within 30 days prior to DL (i.e., at baseline), participants will undergo comprehensive and rigorous assessment of pain and disability-generating factors including: 1) SS symptoms with the Brigham Spinal Stenosis questionnaire (BSS, the most specific available LSS measurement tool); 2) musculoskeletal comorbidities (scoliosis, kyphosis, hip osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia symptoms, severity of spinal stenosis, degenerative disc and facet disease); 3) mood (depression [with the CES-D], anxiety [with the GAD-7]); 4) cognitive function (normal vs. mild cognitive impairment with the computer-based assessment of mild cognitive impairment); 5) psychological function (fear-avoidance beliefs [with the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire], chronic pain self-efficacy [with the Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scales], dysfunctional pain coping skills [with the Cognitive Strategies Questionnaire], treatment expectancy, illicit substance use, alcohol use, smoking status, PTSD symptoms); 6) medical comorbidity (including BMI); 7) demographic factors (age, gender, race, educational/marital status). The BSS will be collected at baseline, at the first postoperative visit, and every 3 months for one year. Prediction rules, based on the comprehensive set of factors measured and DL success/failure determined by the BSS, will be created using multiple methods to maximize predictive accuracy and validated subsequently in a separate cohort of 100 individuals. We will apply these rules to future comparative effectiveness trials that test personalized LSS treatment approaches (i.e., that involve targeting extra-LSS factors as part of the total treatment package) as compared with DL alone. An exploratory aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the use of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) as a DL outcome. This patient-centered outcomes measurement approach is used commonly in the rehabilitation setting, but never before in DL patients. To prepare for future comparative effectiveness trials, we want to develop GAS as an outcome measure because it can be used to track outcomes in SS patients across surgical and non-surgical interventions, and we anticipate that both will be employed as part of personalized treatment. We will explore (through 10-12 patient interviews) and refine (with a modified Delphi panel of experts) GAS goals in patients with SS, and measure goal achievement in a subset of 20 participants. What might happen if older adults with LSS were treated in the context of a comprehensive pre-operative program before undergoing DL? Might long-term outcomes associated with DL improve? Might patient satisfaction improve? Might some patients avoid DL? These are questions that ultimately we hope to answer."
"9332535","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe loss of vision occurs due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and approximately 11 million people in the US have some form of AMD which is expected to double by 2050. Most of the current clinical treatments are primarily focused on slowing down the progression of the disease, as there is neither a cure that can stop the degeneration nor a therapy, other than retinal prostheses, that can restore vision lost due to the degeneration. Current systems, however, are limited by poor resolution (higher electrode density requiring more current, leading to heat production), retinal damage over a time period and cellular overgrowth due to surgical implantation. Use of optogenetic sensitization of retinal cells has several advantages over electrical stimulation such as single-cell resolution, cellular specificity and minimal-invasiveness. However, clinical translation of optogenetic enabled vision restoration suffers from the drawback of active stimulation by blue light source having intensity order of magnitude higher than ambient light owing to the narrow spectral sensitivity of single opsins. To allow ambient-light based stimulation, we propose to utilize (via intravitreal injection lenti-viral vector carrying multi- color opsins (VMCO) to sensitize retinal ganglion cells in photodegenerated AMD retina to different colors of light, allowing broad spectral excitability and thus, significantly higher sensitivity to ambient light. The overall objective of this Phase I SBIR project is to demonstrate behavioral restoration of vision in mice models of late-stage AMD with ambient-level white-light stimulation of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), sensitized by VMCO. Towards this goal we have following aims: (i) Evaluation of long-term viability and functioning of virally-delivered multi-color opsin sensitized degenerated-retina of AMD mice model; and (ii) Behavioral restoration of vision in mice models of late stage AMD after multi-color opsin sensitization of the degenerated-retina. This proposal is a collaborative effort between NanoScope Technologies, Retina Foundation, and Drs. Mohanty and Kim's laboratories at University of Texas. Success of this proposal will lead to a new clinical approach for treating patients with AMD by conventional intravitreal injection of virus carrying opsin constructs. We believe that such treatment will lead to restoration of high-resolution vision in AMD patients by white-light stimulation of multi-color opsin sensitized RGCs at ambient light level. Upon completion of the Phase I we envision a Phase II SBIR targeted at (i) optimizing the final product design and method, (ii) identifying AMD-population for treatment, (iii) submission of orphan drug license application to FDA, and (iv) providing core marketing material for commercializing the product and method."
"9197819","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"8999054","Project Summary/Abstract  The overall goal of the Gastrointestinal Cancers (GI) Program is to rapidly translate basic, population, and  clinical research findings into more effective prevention and treatment strategies for patients with GI cancers.  We have built a successful translational team through the close collaboration of GI clinical investigators with  basic and population scientists. The Program is based on Team Science and, as a result, 27 members from  nine academic departments in two schools are organized around the causes, prevention, and treatment of GI  cancers, effectively facilitating bed to bench and bench to bedside research. Our clinician investigators are  members of NCI task forces and PIs of national clinical trials in gastric, colon, and biliary cancer. Program  members have $11M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which 45% is from NCI, 36% is from NIH, and  3% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. They interact regularly via a series of weekly and monthly  seminars/meetings that facilitate exchange of recent research findings and interdisciplinary collaborations  between Program investigators. These structured forums have fostered a large number of collaborative  projects across the basic, population science, and clinical spectrum. During the last five years, the Program  has generated 626 GI cancer related publications, of which 31% were inter-programmatic, 18% were intra-  programmatic, and 50% inter-institutional. Heinz-Josef Lenz and Michael Kahn are Co-Leaders of the  Program. Dr. Lenz is a physician-scientist internationally known for his work on pharmacogenomics and drug  development in GI cancers. Dr. Kahn is a basic scientist and expert on signal transduction pathways and drug  development. He is internationally known for his work in Wnt signaling, which has led to the development of the  novel Wnt signaling modulator PRI-724, developed by Prism Pharma. PRI-724 completed a Phase Ia human  clinical trial in 2012 and is currently in multiple Phase III trials. Other Program investigators have played pivotal  roles in advancing the knowledge base in GI carcinogenesis and treatment outcomes.

"9358505","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): National Human Genome Research Institute's vision for genomic medicine includes elements of both discovery and implementation. This vision seeks to improve the practice of medicine through the appropriate integration of genomic information into clinical care while continuing to better understand fundamentals of genomic variation, genome structure and the role of genetic variation in disease and therapeutic outcomes. The eMERGE network has made critical contributions to discovery by developing methods for high throughput electronic phenotyping using information captured in electronic health records (EHRs) in the course of clinical care and identifying new associations between diseases and quantitative traits with common genetic variants through genome wide associations studies. eMERGE has also provided leadership in implementing genomic medicine by developing interfaces with EHR, clinical decision support, strategies for holding genomic variant information and transferring clinically relevant variants into the EHR, and returning genomic variant information to physicians and patients, both for disease susceptibility and for improving therapeutic management, particularly with prescription and dosing of medications. In addition, development and dissemination of best practices for implementation has been an important goal of eMERGE. As a participant in both eMERGE I and II, Northwestern (NU) through its EHR-linked biobank NUgene, has made significant contributions to all of these activities, with several NU investigators playing key leadership roles. In this application we propose to leverage the infrastructure and expertise at NU to (a) discover associations between rare variants in at least 100 sequenced genes and common variants from the eMERGE GWAS dataset from phenotypes derived from EHR data mining, (b) enroll 2000 patients into the study who agree to receive genomic information and allow the information to be stored in their EHR, (c) return clinically actionable results to healthcare providers and patients to determine utility and clinical outcomes, and (d) develop and share best practices related to returning genomic results, educating physicians and patients, and the related ethical, legal and social implications. Successfully achieving these goals will provide new scientific knowledge and significant real world experience that will advance the NHGRI vision for both discovery and implementation across the spectrum of its strategic vision."
"9071073","Project Summary  Wilms tumor is the most common pediatric kidney cancer and the 3rd most common solid tumor of childhood.  Wilms tumor is treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, and while most children  are cured, survival remains poor in those with advanced-stage disease. Adverse late effects of chemotherapy  are common and affect the quality of life of survivors. Better molecular knowledge of Wilms tumor is necessary  to develop novel therapies that are more effective and less toxic. Known driver mutations (WT1, WTX, and  CTNNB1) are identified in only one-third of Wilms tumors. Recently, we sequenced a large cohort of Wilms  tumor specimens and identified recurrent, somatic heterozygous missense mutations in the enzyme DROSHA,  which were mutually exclusive with known driver mutations in WT1 and CTNNB1. DROSHA is a ribonuclease  that is essential for the first step in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that play critical roles  in the biology of cancer. Wilms tumor is the first human cancer in which DROSHA mutations have been  identified. However, it is currently unknown how DROSHA mutations impact miRNA biogenesis and contribute  to Wilms tumor pathogenesis. DROSHA mutations in Wilms tumors occur at or near conserved metal-binding  residues in the ribonuclease (RNase) III domains, and impair miRNA processing. Importantly, we discovered  that Wilms tumors with DROSHA mutations exhibit greatly reduced expression of a specific sub-class of  miRNAs, including multiple members of the let-7 tumor suppressor miRNA family. let-7 miRNAs regulate  several known oncogenes in Wilms tumors, including MCYN and LIN28, and therefore loss of expression of  these miRNAs is likely to contribute to tumorigenesis in this setting. To establish the clinical significance of  molecular subtype in Wilms tumors, we will correlate the presence of known and novel mutations with clinical  outcome in a large collection of clinically-annotated Wilms tumor specimens. Our preliminary data suggest that  heterozygous DROSHA mutations operate through a dominant-negative mechanism. We hypothesize that  heterozygous DROSHA RNase III missense mutations drive tumorigenesis by impairing the biogenesis of a  specific set of tumor suppressor miRNAs, reprogramming the miRNA expression program in the developing  kidney to facilitate Wilms tumor development. We will test this hypothesis using state-of-the-art genomic editing  techniques to recreate tumor-specific DROSHA mutations in Wilms tumor cells. We will identify and validate  specific miRNAs whose dysregulated expression drives tumorigenesis. We will test a novel targeted  therapeutic strategy using genetically-engineered cell lines and mouse models of Wilms tumor. Elucidation of  these mechanisms will provide critical molecular insights into Wilms tumor and potentially reveal new  therapeutic approaches based on miRNA delivery or pharmacologic modulation of downstream pathways."
"9144338","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing globally, which is thought to account for a substantial number of chronic diseases and cancers. Surgical treatment of obesity has been shown to be effective in long- term weight control, provide additional benefits to people with obesity-related diseases, and reduce relative risk of death. However, it is not universally available to all classes of obese people. The proposed research will closely examine the costs and effectiveness of bariatric surgery. The ultimate goal is to examine the appropriateness of current NIH guidelines and to inform insurance companies, patients, providers, and the government of the most cost-effective surgical treatment of obesity. The Research Specific Aims are to (1) examine the association between obesity, obesity-related comorbidities, and mortality; (2) evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bariatric surgery; (3) investigate the costs attributable to obesity-related diseases; and (4) conduct cost-consequence analyses of bariatric surgery. The research methodology includes econometric modeling (Research Specific Aim 1 and 3), meta-analysis (Research Specific Aim 2), microsimulation (Research Specific Aim 3 and 4), and cost-effectiveness analysis (Research Specific Aim 4). In order to successfully complete the proposed research, this project will also provide the applicant with mentoring by three experts who, in conjunction with didactic training, will enable the applicant to grow into an effective and independent health services research investigator and health economist in obesity prevention and control. The mentoring team and the applicant have worked together and identified three Career Development Aims: (1) to become an independent and externally-funded researcher; (2) to obtain working knowledge of obesity epidemiology and gastroenterology; (3) to enhance the quality of research by obtaining training in the areas of public health and quantitative modeling. These aims will be achieved through a variety of training strategies, including regular one-on-one meetings with each of three mentors who are experts in the relevant domains, didactic coursework, high-quality online training modules, and attendance at scientific conferences and workshops. The proposed research will provide preliminary data and results for several R21 and an R01 or equivalent applications. These projects will expand to examine other interventions to control obesity, e.g., exercise, diet, medications, and surgery and will be compared within a metric of intensity; alternatively, these projects will examine the relationship between obesity and cancer and how interventions to control obesity can alter this relationship."
"9185763","Project Summary Chloroquine retinopathy is a growing health problem with the increased use of the drug to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Patients present with a loss of central vision, retinal pigmented epithelium abnormalities, and bull?s eye maculopathy. There is currently no treatment other than to stop giving chloroquine; this limits the long-term treatment of the other diseases, and the retention of chloroquine in pigmented tissues enables progressing loss of vision even after treatment has stopped. While is known to target RPE lysosomes and impair their degradative activity, it remains unclear how this leads to vision loss and how this can be treated. Recently, lysosomes have been identified as playing a critical role in intracellular and extracellular signaling, with lysosomal function extending beyond degradation to calcium signaling and the exocytosis of waste, transmitters and inflammatory signals. This proposal will determine whether these newly identified lysosomal functions are perturbed in chloroquine retinopathy. The ability of chloroquine treatment to alter lysosomal calcium signaling and exocytosis will be assayed first in our in vitro model of chloroquine retinopathy, then confirmed in our newly developed in vivo murine model of chloroquine retinopathy. The proposal will then determine whether treatments developed in recent years to enhance lysosomal pH and calcium regulation prevent the pathological changes induced by chloroquine. The restoration of lysosomal function will be determined using both in vitro and in vivo models. Finally, the ability of these treatments to prevent the loss of vision and photoreceptors in the chloroquine retinopathy mouse will be determined. The results of the project will advance our mechanistic understanding of RPE signaling in health and disease while potentially helping answer a real health need."

"9356875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the lung that currently afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide. While asthma is mediated by an excessive Th2 immune response to allergens, recent evidence suggests that production of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17A, is associated with the development of more severe disease. While severe asthmatics are at greatest risk for morbidity or death following acute exacerbations, and can be refractory to therapies that are highly effective in individuals with mild disease, the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-17A contributes to the development of severe allergic asthma are ill-defined. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A facilitates severe asthma would provide additional therapeutic targets for populations underserved by current therapies. Using a mouse model we provide evidence that severe asthma is associated with increased IL-17A production, and is compounded by enhanced Il17ra expression and elevated responsiveness to IL-17A. These alterations in IL-17A production and responsiveness exacerbate IL-13-driven STAT6 activation, gene expression, and airway responses. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-17A-mediated enhancement of IL-13-driven responses occur through two, non-mutually independent mechanisms in mouse cells; 1) by causing the dissociation of a complex including IL-13R?1 and TRAF3, which normally limits IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation, and 2) by activating transcription factors (NF-?B, C/EBP? and C/EBP?) which can enhance IL-13/STAT6 driven gene expression. While preliminary studies presented here also suggest that similar mechanisms may operate in human cell lines, the extent to which the observations made in our mouse model apply to humans with severe asthma is unclear. Three specific aims are proposed to identify the molecular mechanisms through which IL-17A enhances asthma severity in mice, and humans. Specific Aim 1 will determine if the increased IL-13-driven STAT6 phosphorylation and AHR observed in the presence of IL-17A is the result of the dissociation of the IL- 13R?1:TRAF3 complex following initiation of IL-17A signaling. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the importance of IL- 17A-driven activation of NF-?B (canonical versus non-canonical), C/EBP? and C/EBP? in IL-13/IL-17A synergy in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will directly test whether similar synergistic interactions between IL-13 and IL-17A are observed in asthma relevant, primary human cells. Additionally, we will determine whether severe asthma in children is associated, as it is in the mouse, with increased IL-17A production, IL17RA expression, and IL-17A responsiveness. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will move us beyond the Th2 paradigm of allergic asthma, begin to characterize the mechanisms whereby Th17-products trigger the development of severe allergic asthma, and determine whether similar mechanisms may be at play in mice and humans. A better understanding of these mechanisms will enable us to identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in individuals with severe asthma, a population underserved by current therapies."
"8999049","Project Summary/Abstract  The Molecular Genetics Program has been continuously approved through the NCI CCSG since the USC  Norris first received NCI designation over 35 years ago. This Program has always been distinguished  nationally for its strength in DNA replication and DNA repair, with an emphasis on applying discoveries toward  cancer chemotherapy. During the project period, Preet Chaudhary joined Michael Lieber as Co-Leader to add  depth in translation and oversee a new theme on the molecular genetics of cancers associated with infection  by HHV8, including the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of these cancers. The Program  has three integrated aims: 1) DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell proliferation in genetic instability; 2) DNA  repair and recombination in genetic instability; and 3) viral oncogenesis with an emphasis on HHV8. Lymphoid  malignancies are used as a disease model used by Program members for all three aims. Members continue to  be highly interactive within and across themes and across program boundaries. The 39 Program members,  who come from three schools and 13 departments, have $11.4M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of  which 18% is from NCI, 61% from other NIH sources, and 8% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. The  Program is highly productive with 439 publications of which 21% are inter-programmatic, 15% intra-  programmatic and 25% inter-institutional. Program Leaders organize retreats and mini-symposia several times  per year to cross-fertilize research within and across Programs while remaining watchful to ensure a high level  of member crosstalk. This has led to high success in securing new P01s that are intra- and inter-programmatic,  while also cross-cutting thematically. Examples include renewal of an NCI P01 on understanding human DNA  polymerase active sites and development of new chemotherapeutics (Goodman, McKenna, Warshel), and a  new NCI P01 on viral oncogenesis by KSHV (HHV8) (Jung, Feng, Gao). Members have been particularly  successful in seeking new cancer drug therapies, which has been achieved with the Translational and Clinical  Sciences Program."
"9144343","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Radiation therapy (RT), together with surgery and chemotherapy, is one of the most important modalities for cancer treatments. Patient safety is a paramount issue with radiation therapy. The safety concerns in radiation therapy have been recognized by many different national and international organizations including IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection), NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission), WHO (World Health Organization), ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) and AAPM (American Association of Physicists in Medicine) in the past few decades. RT error was ranked as the #1 health technology hazard by ECRI (Emergency Care Research Institute). The field of radiation therapy as a whole has been attempting to improve patient safety over the past decades through the adoption of rigorous clinical workflows following the lessons learned from the previous incidents and following the guidelines published by the aforementioned organizations. However, as technologies become increasingly reliant on digital communication and workflows, the manual-auditing based safety measures continue to exhibit their limitations and antiquatedness. In this project, we propose to develop an automated health information technology (HIT) system to improve patient safety, treatment quality and working efficiency for radiation therapy. This system will continuously monitor errors and traces of inconsistencies in the patient data and documents in the clinical patient treatment systems, to make users aware of any patient safety issues. It is expected that the treatment quality will be improved by automatic performance of the standard-of-care quality checks and minimization of human errors in the clinical workflow. It is also expected that the working efficiency will be significantly improved due to the automatic safety and quality checks which when performed manually often account for approximately 50% of human worker workload. Over the past three years, we have been building such a HIT system and have demonstrated the clinical safety and quality significance and potential efficiency gains in our preliminary results. In this new project we plan to fundamentally overhaul our current efforts by making the computer-based safety and quality checks more accurate, responsive, user-friendly, powerful and fully automated. We also plan to integrate human factors into the design features, which were identified from the preliminary data, thereby maximizing the impacts of the system on safety and quality."
"9301173","Project Summary Many pharmacotherapies capitalize on the powerful control of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) over peripheral organ functions, but unintended side effects of drugs are often an important issue. Therefore, more function-specific activation of autonomic outflow would be a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire for many conditions and diseases. Here we propose to apply the modern tool box of neuron-specific manipulation such as optogenetic and pharmacogenetic stimulation and inhibition to the ANS. This technology is based on neurotrophic viral vectors carrying instructions for transfecting excitatory or inhibitory ion channels or receptors into specific neuron populations and has been widely used in the CNS of rodents. Because the technology has not yet been used in the ANS, we will test the feasibility of different viruses and viral constructs to selectively transfect sympathetic (SNS) neurons innervating adipose tissue as a model system (Aim 1) and use genetically based technology to generate a gene profile of adipose tissue related SNS neurons that are verified in human tissue. This should result in i) viral constructs with proven ability to selectively and efficiently infect/transfect postganglionic SNS neurons, ii) maps of chemo-specific postganglionic SNS neurons innervating brown and white adipose tissue in the mouse, and iii) maps of detailed innervation patterns of adipose tissue pads for future selective denervation and electrical stimulation approaches, iv) genetic profile of adipose tissue related SNS neurons and their representation in human SNS neurons. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of acute and chronic optogenetic and pharmacogenetic stimulation of successfully transfected postganglionic SNS neurons innervating brown adipose tissue to induce thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and body weight loss and SNS neurons innervating subcutaneous white adipose tissue to induce lipolysis and browning. We will thus provide proof-of-principle for genetically-based functionally specific ANS manipulation that could be applied to any other postganglionic autonomic neuron, such as the noradrenergic innervation of hepatocytes and pancreatic islets, as well as cholinergic (vagal) innervation of myenteric plexus neurons throughout the gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic islets, the biliary system, and the liver. This will ultimately allow selective manipulation of other aspects of energy balance and glucose homeostasis as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, urogenital, and gastrointestinal functions in a modular fashion."
"9073483","Project 1  Project summary/abstract  Our Herpesvirus studies have long been a part of this program project Grant (PPG). Previously we focused  on HSV-1 lytic replication but in the last renewal began a transition to KSHV to align our work with our PPG  colleagues. Our studies combine high resolution electron microscopy (EM) and other biophysical methods  with protein purification and biochemical analysis --a highly productive approach unique to our laboratory. We  recently made great strides with our purified HSV-1 replication factors: demonstration of rolling circle  replication and a transition in these reactions to DNA network formation, and evidence for origin dependent  replication. With the purified KSHV replication factors we are positioned to make major discoveries in the  KSHV arena. Our guiding hypothesis is that understanding lytic activation and replication is critical to  understanding viral oncogenesis and cancer and further, that scaffolds of filaments formed by KSHV ORF6  protein generate the nuclear replication compartments within which the replication occurs.   In Aim I we examine the properties of the purified KSHV replication factors: the polymerase accessory  factor, the helicase-promase and the single strand binding protein, ORF6. The work will employ EM, surface  plasmon resonance, and biochemical assays. The polarity of assembly of ORF6 along single strand DNA will  be determined. Novel properties of the protein which links the helicase and primase together and the  polymerase accessory factor will be explored. Genetic mutants will be generated with the Damania group.  Assembly of ORF6 into protein scaffolds like those in the nucleus will be examined. In Aim II, rolling circle  replication will be explored in vitro using the purified KSHV factors. Products will be compared to replicating  DNA isolated from cells undergoing lytic replication at different times. The ability of the in vitro replication  system to generate DNA networks typical of late replication products in vivo will be examined. Mutant proteins  will be generated with the Damania group and their properties examined. The way in which viral and host  proteins organize the latent origin of replication will be examined by EM in collaboration with the Dittmer group.  In Aim III, the progress of lytic KSHV replication in cells will be followed at the molecular to cellular levels using  light and EM methods, genetic mutations in selected proteins, and new cutting edge EM technologies including  cryo-shadowing and a new method (miniSOG) in which proteins are tagged and localized at an EM level in thin  sections. Morphology of the mitochondria, cytoskeleton and nucleus will be examined. We will further test our  hypothesis that filaments of ORF6 create a scaffold in the nucleus upon which replication takes place. The  work is highly integrated with studies in the Damania and Dittmer groups where our results will help to drive  their studies. We will continue to develop highly innovative EM methods and apply them in studies with our  colleagues in the in the PPG. Results using these new imaging approaches will aid their genetic and cellular  studies making the net result highly integrated and interactive."
"9126269","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New Mexico's Prevention Research Center (PRC), is committed to eliminating health disparities and reducing the burden of chronic disease. The PRC examines how to link evidence to practice and policy through translation, dissemination, and implementation research. In response to community needs and CDC priorities, we focus our research and scholarship on reducing the burden of obesity (Winnable Battles1), diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Our commitment is to investigate and discover solutions to the burden of disease experienced by under-represented populations, especially American Indians and Hispanics, living in under-resourced rural communities. Specifically, we address the underlying risk factors for chronic diseases that have high prevalence in these populations. Utilizing our well-established infrastructure, multidisciplinary research team, strong  partnerships and proven record of accomplishments, we propose to investigate, expand and disseminate what is most effective and feasible in rural communities based upon the findings of our prior research. We plan to study the process of dissemination and implementation (D&I) of evidence-based strategies for increasing physical activity, improving nutrition, and promoting tobacco free living. We are calling our research project Village Interventions and Venues for Action II, (VIVA II) to indicate that our proposed study is both a continuation, and major expansion and scaling-up of VIVA-Step into Cuba, our 2010-2014 research project. We have worked successfully with partners in Cuba, New Mexico to evaluate the translation, dissemination and implementation of 5 evidence-based recommendations from the Guide to Community Preventive Services. The PRC plans to continue and expand the existing study (Beta Site), scale up its successful strategies to rural communities county-wide (Proximity Spread) through a health council partnership, disseminate and implement strategies state-wide (Widespread Application) with the help of key organizational partners, and study the process for its successes and failures. Building on national, state, community and PRC priorities, the UNM PRC will address existing gaps in translating evidence-based interventions into practice by expanding our knowledge and understanding of the D&I process. We will do this through a prospective study of the D&I of effective strategies to promote active living, healthy eating, and tobacco free living in tri-ethnic, rural populations in New Mexico."
"9249762","PROJECT SUMMARY  With one of the world's most severe HIV and TB epidemics and an economy dependent upon labor migration to South African mines, Lesotho is an optimal setting to study the effectiveness of TB/HIV integration strategies. HIV prevalence in Lesotho is 23%, the world's second highest; the TB incidence rate of 852 per 100,000 is the world's highest; 72% of TB patients are HIV positive. Basotho migrant miners, who travel between their homes in Lesotho and work in South African mines, and their families are among those with elevated risk of HIV and TB. We found that 32% of miners and miners' family members tested for HIV in three TEBA mining employment offices in Lesotho in 2014-15 were newly diagnosed with HIV; an additional 7% were known to be HIV positive. The TB incidence rate in South African miners is estimated at 3,000-7,000 per 100,000 per year, several-fold higher than that in the populations from which they originate. Testing, linkage, and retention of miners and their families along the TB/HIV care continuum are suboptimal, and TB treatment outcomes are also poor compared with the general population. Implementation science research is urgently needed to determine an effective strategy for improving early detection of HIV and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) among migrant miners and their families.  The PROvide MIner-friendly SErvices for Integrated TB/HIV Care (PROMISE) Study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of integrated TB/HIV services for migrant miners and their family members provided in miner-friendly service venues (MF). A prospective cohort study design will be used to compare the effectiveness of the MF intervention, which includes provision of family-focused, integrated TB/HIV diagnosis, care and treatment services at TEBA offices six days per week, to public sector health facilities, which deliver usual integrated care for TB and HIV. Additionally, we will assess HIV testing yield to identify PLHIV with CD4 count >500 cells/µl, time spent accessing ART and IPT services, and costs associated with delivery of the MF intervention. We will also explore patients' and providers' perceived barriers, facilitators and preferences to understand how they impact uptake and delivery of the MF intervention.  The study will leverage long-standing collaborations between ICAP, the Lesotho Ministry of Health, National University of Lesotho and TEBA and a well-trained, highly productive team with substantial experience in implementation science research in sub-Saharan Africa to identify an effective, feasible and acceptable TB/HIV service delivery model for migrant miners and their families that addresses barriers to implementation of early ART and IPT. The ultimate goals of the project are to 1) improve health outcomes among migrant miners and their families, a hard-to-reach population that represents a hotspot of TB/HIV transmission, in Lesotho and in PEPFAR programs more broadly; and 2) strengthen the implementation science research capacity of national and local institutions."
"9200229","This application requests support to conduct structural and stigma-focused interventions to increase HIV and STI testing uptake among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Our research proposal is focused on this population due to the alarmingly high rates of HIV/STI among BMSM? this group has experienced elevated rates of HIV incidence and prevalence since the beginning of the US epidemic, and current estimates demonstrate that although BMSM make up only 0.2% of the population they make up 22% of new HIV infections. In our own work we have documented a 5.1% annual HIV incidence and a 35% HIV prevalence among BMSM. We are failing to engage BMSM at all points of the HIV care continuum including the seek and test components. The CDC recommends that individuals at substantial risk for HIV be tested for HIV/STI every three to six months; however, this goal is not being achieved and, therefore, a new approach to engaging BMSM is needed. To address these shortcomings and based on preliminary studies, we are proposing a 2 x 2 factorial design to evaluate a model that is aimed at increasing HIV/STI testing uptake among BMSM. We will test a stigma-focused intervention as stigma is a known deterrent to HIV/STI testing, yet little has been done to address this factor; and, we will evaluate HIV/STI test counseling delivered online (in conjunction with at-home HIV/STI test kits) as this delivery of testing may remove key barriers to reaching BMSM in need of HIV/STI related care services. Specific Aim 1: Assess HIV/STI testing uptake at scheduled HIV/STI test counseling appointments during the 12 month follow-up period. 500 BMSM who are HIV negative/unknown status, and report condomless anal intercourse with a male partner in past year and infrequent HIV/STI testing (?1 HIV/STI test in past year) will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (a) receive CDC-based risk reduction counseling and scheduled for in-office HIV/STI test counseling appointments, (b) receive HIV stigma-enhanced intervention and scheduled for in-office HIV/STI test counseling appointments, (c) receive CDC-based risk reduction counseling and scheduled for online, via video calling, HIV/STI test counseling appointments, or (d) receive HIV stigma-enhanced intervention and scheduled for online, via video calling, HIV/STI test counseling appointments. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate mediating (key theoretical stigma variables) factors collected via assessments at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-ups. Specific Aim 3: Conduct an economic evaluation to determine the costs of the office-based and online-based HIV/STI test delivery formats from both a community-based payer perspective and a comprehensive societal perspective that includes all costs. Our project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful impact not only on approaches to engaging BMSM, but to improving HIV/STI testing uptake which will likely improve multiple health outcomes among BMSM. If effective, our approach to improving HIV/STI testing uptake would be available for dissemination immediately and would fit within resource limited settings such as community based organizations and health departments."
"9047696","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this application is to determine if the administration of nebulized albuterol during exercise can improve the delivery and physiological responses of albuterol, a bronchodilator, in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). This project wil provide excellent intellectual and robust technical training opportunities to support the applicant  in achieving her goal of becoming an independent investigator studying translational cardiopulmonary physiology. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the degree of bronchodilation will be greatest when exercise and albuterol are combined in healthy individuals and in those with CF, compared to albuterol or exercise alone. We will assess bronchodilation [change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow for 25-75% of the forced vital capacity (FEF25-75)] in response to three treatments: 1) exercise, 2) nebulized albuterol administration, and 3) exercise combined with albuterol administration. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the duration of bronchodilation will be lowest after exercise, and will significantly increase when exercise is combined with albuterol. We will assess bronchodilation for 6 hours after each treatment and will accept our hypothesis if albuterol administration during moderate aerobic exercise has the largest area under the curve for bronchodilation (FEV1 and FEF25-75) over 6 hours. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that giving nebulized albuterol during exercise will improve drug delivery. We will measure plasma albuterol concentrations for 6 hours in response to each of the three conditions and run pharmacokinetic analyses. We predict that the delivery of nebulized albuterol during exercise will have an improved pharmacokinetic profile (maximum concentration and area under the curve) as compared to standard nebulized albuterol therapy. Administration of an inhaled bronchodilator during exercise may lead to better delivery and distribution of the drug, which could augment or prolong the bronchodilatory and pharmacokinetic effect of exercise or albuterol alone. This study will serve as proof of concept that combining exercise with aerosolized drug administration can improve drug delivery, which would be beneficial for other inhaled therapies in CF. In addition, regular delivery of albuterol during exercise would replace a  daily sedentary activity with an active one, which could help CF patients reap the many benefits of regular exercise by allowing two therapies (exercise and inhaled medications) to be utilized at the same time while potentially receiving synergistic treatment effects. We propose a novel, high-impact, and translational study investigating the pharmacokinetic and bronchodilatory effects of delivering nebulized albuterol during exercise. The research team, combined with the extensive resources at the Mayo Clinic, provides the optimal training environment to complete studies in this area."
"9128719","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intellectual disabilities (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly prevalent disorders of developmental delay with substantial overlap. ID and ASD are highly heritable, but because of genetic heterogeneity only about 15% of ASD patients and 50% of ID patients have a specific genetic diagnosis. Identified genetic causes of ASD and ID suggest common genetic pathways in disease pathogenesis including synaptic dysfunction, cytoskeletal dynamics in spine development, the Ras-MAPK pathway, and histone modification. In collaboration with two fellows in the laboratory of my sponsor, Christopher A. Walsh, I have recently identified a large family from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates with recessively inherited ID with autistic features. We have identified a truncating mutation in a novel, uncharacterized gene in all affected individuals from this family. An unanswered question in developmental neurobiology is how the various cellular pathways that contain identified ASD and ID genes are coordinated in normal cognitive development. Understanding the function of this gene, a predicted methyltransferase that may regulate multiple genes through protein modification, can provide insight into coordination between cellular pathways for cognitive development disrupted in ASD and ID. I propose the following experiments to investigate the function of this gene. In Specific Aim 1, I will determine if the truncating mutation in this family is a loss of function allele, and will search for additional loss of function alleles in this gene in other ID and ASD patients. In Specific Aim 2, I will characterize subcellular localization, interaction partners, and methyltransferase activity of the protein encoded by this gene. In Specific Aim 3, I will collaborate with the lab of my co-sponsor, Michael Greenberg, to characterize neuron morphology and activity-dependent gene expression in the absence of this gene."
"9237405","Infections with the mold pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus continue to be a major obstacle to the effective management of immunocompromised patients, particularly those with hematologic malignancies, organ transplants, chronic granulomatous disease, or cystic fibrosis. Despite several advances in our understanding of this infection, it is unclear how this fungus adapts so readily to the host environment, and escapes clearance in situations of chronic colonization. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling pathway that senses the stress load on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and communicates that information to the nucleus. Current evidence indicates that AF, and other pathogenic fungi, rely heavily on the UPR to support virulence and antifungal drug resistance. However, the mechanisms by which this is accomplished are incompletely understood. The preliminary data in this grant provide evidence for a new mechanism of UPR function that involves the regulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels in response to two stress conditions that AF must adapt to in the host: (1) loss of ER homeostasis caused by increased demand on the secretory pathway, and (2) direct attack by cells of the innate immune system. Since Ca2+ is a potent second messenger, these findings suggest that the UPR integrates with signaling pathways that decode cytoplasmic Ca2+ signatures into host adaptive responses. We propose three aims to determine the mechanisms by which AF adapts to these stressors; Aim 1 will establish how the UPR links to Ca2+ signaling during ER stress and the relationship it has to calcineurin activation and virulence, Aim 2 will identify the mechanism by which cells of the innate immune system trigger Ca2+ influx into the fungus and elucidate the impact of these events on fungal survival. Lastly, Aim 3 will use an unbiased approach to delineate the genome-wide transcriptional and translational responses to neutrophil attack, and their dependency upon Ca2+ signaling. The outcome of this study will reveal new mechanisms of host adaptation by this fungus, which will pave the way for future therapeutic strategies to augment host clearance mechanisms."

"9235784","The sensory and motor impairments associated with peripheral neuropathy lead to poor physical functioning, postural control and balance. These changes affect the activities of daily living and increase the risk of falling, subsequently leading to increased morbidity and decreased quality of life. [In an effort to maximize functional recovery from injuries, many veterans will undergo surgical procedures to their affected limbs.] Anesthesiologists commonly use local anesthetics (LAs) to perform peripheral nerve blocks that result in temporary control of pain during or after a surgical procedure. Peripheral nerve damage can occur as a complication from peripheral nerve blocks and the mechanism of injury remains unknown. It has been well documented that all LAs are toxic to neurons. Because LAs are frequently applied to sites in our veterans where peripheral nerves are diseased or injured, understanding their effects on injured neurons has important implications for clinical practice.  Our long-term goal is [to maximize functional recovery in veterans suffering from nerve impairments] by understanding how LAs affect pre-existing peripheral nerve injuries. The objective is to determine if LAs worsen peripheral neuron cell death and/or slow functional recovery [in a chronic model] of peripheral nerve injury. Our central hypothesis is that previously injured neurons will be more susceptible to the toxicity of longer-acting LAs and this will result in increased neuron cell death and delayed or absent functional recovery in mice with a previous peripheral nerve injury compared to mice with no injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that an improved understanding of the effects of LAs on neurons will help identify veterans at higher risk for permanent neural deficits after peripheral nerve blocks and/or decrease the risk of neural deficit following peripheral nerve blocks. To test our central hypothesis we will pursue the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Determine if select LAs cause peripheral neuron cell death alone or exacerbate peripheral nerve cell death after a peripheral nerve axotomy or crush in a well-established mouse model of peripheral nerve injury. Select LAs or placebo (saline) will be applied to an intact facial nerve (sham injury), 1 week after a facial nerve axotomy, and 1 week after a facial nerve crush injury. Neuron survival will be determined 4-weeks after LA treatment by cell counts that compare between injured and uninjured nerves.  Specific Aim 2: Determine if select LAs attenuate functional recovery after a peripheral nerve crush injury in a well-established mouse model of peripheral nerve injury. Select LAs or placebo (saline) will be applied to the facial nerve 1 week after a facial nerve crush injury. Neuronal regeneration will be measured by twice daily analysis of functional recovery from a nerve crush injury.  [Specific Aim 3: Explore changes in gene expression of injured neurons treated with LAs identified from Aims 1 and 2. Mice will undergo a facial nerve axtotomy then select local anesthetic applied to the nerve 1 week after injury. We will then sacrifice animals at 0, 1, 3, 7, and 28 days following treatment and use laser capture microdissection to collect tissue from the injured and uninjured facial nuclei to analyze genes associated with regeneration, apoptosis, stress response and sodium channel components.]  The expected outcomes of the proposed research are to identify commonly used LAs that worsen neuron cell death and/or slow functional recovery after a peripheral nerve injury, and to further characterize changes in gene expression. Such results are expected to have an important positive impact, by identifying patients at higher risk for permanent neural deficits or help identify LAs with safer neurotoxicity profiles. The knowledge gained from these studies may impact how clinicians choose appropriate patients to receive peripheral nerve blocks and/or influence which LAs are used on at-risk patients."
"9235186","Abstract: Gastroparesis (GP) presents with chronic upper GI dysmotility symptoms in the setting of delayed gastric emptying without any mechanical obstruction. Inconsistencies exist between subjective symptom severity and objective evidence of GP, and available therapies are limited by accompanying adverse events and unpredictable efficacy. Hence the pathophysiology, clinical course, outcomes and treatment strategies require further investigation. Our response to the NIDDK Gastroparesis Consortium (U01) under RFA-DK-16-010 has the following aims: 1) To complete approved studies initiated by the GpCRC which entails enrolling GP patients to  Gastroparesis Registry 2 with their clinical data and bio-samples as well as obtain gastric tissue  under the pathological basis of gastroparesis (PBG) protocol, when some patients undergo surgery  for failed medical therapy. This data collection will contribute more knowledge about pathogenesis,  pathomorphology, symptoms severity grading, complications, treatment outcomes in patients with  GP and gastroparesis-like presentation but normal gastric emptying. 2) As a new diagnostic strategy, we propose to determine whether endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-  guided core biopsy samples of antral muscularis propria in GP patients can provide sufficient tissue  for full histologic analysis to specifically address status of interstitial cell of Cajal, myenteric plexus  neurons and smooth muscle pathology. After reconfirming the safety and success of this  methodology in a study of 30 patients receiving both endoscopic and surgical biopsies all patients  entering GpR3 as well as GpR2 registry will undergo EUS guided core biopsies of the antral  muscularis propria as part of the database. Therefore we will investigate whether this endoscopic  method can safely replace surgery to obtain smooth muscle tissue and correlate ICC findings with  symptoms, gastric emptying and treatment outcome. 3) We propose to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of a new Dopamine D2/D3 antagonist in  gastroparetic patients of either diabetic or idiopathic etiology by performing a multicenter, double-  blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel three-group study which will also assess cardiac  safety and adverse event. The plan is for the NIH to partner with one of the 2 pharmaceutical  companies developing new agents, Dopamine D2/D3 antagonists with no cardiac toxicity. All GpR3  patients will be invited to enroll into 2 parallel 12 week trials for diabetic and idiopathic etiologies of gastroparesis.  If we are awarded this grant, TTU research team is committed to facilitate the execution of the  protocols and collaborate with other Centers under GpCRC and NIDDK/NIH supervision."
"9167536","Abstract Harnessing optogenetics to diagnose and therapeutically rewire cancer cell signaling  In recent years, advances in microscopy, sequencing, and proteomics have had a dramatic impact on our ability to probe the inner workings of cells and tissues. These tools have revealed that cells are remarkably complex information processing devices: external inputs activate many intracellular networks with complex dynamics. Yet despite the progress in measuring the cell's outputs, we have lacked analogous control over the inputs we can deliver to probe and perturb these complex networks. By replacing chemical stimuli with light, optogenetic tools can be used to apply and remove inputs with high spatial and temporal precision. Here, I propose to bring this precise input control to bear on two long-standing problems in cancer biology, a field where it has so far had limited impact.  First, I will develop an approach termed ?optogenetic profiling?, which aims to directly measure how growth signaling is altered in tumor cells by measuring cellular responses to a rich set of input stimuli. Rooted in engineering, this approach is akin to probing an electronic circuit with a different signals to characterize its function, and can be highly informative even when the exact wiring diagram is unknown. This approach may offer a key to interpreting genomic data, allowing us to group cell lines with different mutations into shared functional classes. It could also have a large impact on treatment: identifying which pathway is deregulated may immediately suggest which targeted pathway inhibitors will be effective. Second, I will explore how light-induced protein aggregation can be used to therapeutically rewire cancer cell signaling. Tumor cells rely on signaling changes that both amplify proliferation and suppress apoptosis, but current therapies are typically limited to inhibiting pro-growth signaling. Here, I will test whether light-induced co-clustering of signaling proteins can perform two other therapeutic functions: amplifying apoptotic signaling or diverting growth inputs to cell-death outputs. The studies proposed will not only uncover fundamental principles in cell signaling but could usher in new approaches for cancer diagnosis (by functionally profiling signaling pathway responses) and treatment (by engineering gain-of-fuction therapies based on signaling enzyme clustering)."
"9190344","Project Summary There is growing evidence that myelin, the insulating sheath enveloping axons and enabling rapid information transmission throughout the mammalian brain, may undergo dynamic changes throughout the course of adult life. These changes may be adaptive, and may play an underappreciated role in normal processes of learning and memory. Currently, the mechanisms underlying adaptive myelination are unclear. Intriguingly, the proliferation rate of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), the resident stem cells in the brain that differentiate to form myelinating oligodendrocytes, in mice is regulated by neuronal activity, suggesting that communication between neurons and OPCs may mediate adaptive myelin change. A leading candidate for the mode of this communication is neuron-OPC synaptic communication, which has been described in rodents but whose role remains unclear. We have recently found that neuroligin 3 ? a key regulator of neuronal synaptic function ? is highly expressed in OPCs. In this proposal, we intend to shed light on how neuroligin 3 may contribute to adaptive myelination. Understanding mechanisms behind neural activity-induced OPC proliferation is of critical importance in human disease as well, given that many human neural cancers are thought to derive from oligodendrocyte-lineage cells and that selective oligodendrocyte depletion is a hallmark of a range of white matter diseases. In our first aim, we will assess whether neuroligin 3 expression in OPCs is required for myelination. This will be the first cell-specific investigation of the role of a synaptic regulatory protein in white matter development in vivo. In our second aim, we will examine whether deletion of neuroligin 3 in OPCs impacts neuron-OPC synaptic communication, the first study of synaptic regulation at neuron-OPC synapses. In our final aim, we will employ optogenetics ? a technology enabling activation of genetically-defined ensembles of neurons in freely behaving animals ? to determine whether neuroligin 3 is required for neuronal activity-induced adaptive myelination. Taken together, this proposal will enable groundbreaking studies of a leading hypothesized mechanism for neuron-OPC communication that could modulate OPC proliferation and contribute to adaptive myelination. Understanding these mechanisms is likely to prove critical for building our knowledge of how neuron-OPC interactions contribute to learning and memory, development of brain tumors, and pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions in white matter disease."
"9177128","Project Summary/Abstract:  Despite the successful expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit over decades that increased the labor supply of single mothers in the US, many mothers on welfare had not transitioned to work as of the early 1990s. With welfare participation becoming viewed by many as a cause of dependence rather than a consequence of disadvantage, a dramatic restructuring of the cash assistance system for poor families took place. This major policy shift, which imposed work requirements and time limits as conditions for receiving cash assistance, provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the effects of maternal work incentives on the behaviors of low-income adolescent children, who are at risk of perpetuating an intergenerational cycle of poverty. The new regime was successful, in that welfare caseloads plummeted and employment of low-skilled women increased. An implicit assumption was that the work-focused regime would disrupt an assumed transmission of welfare dependence to the next generation. However, few studies have considered how the new regime affects children?particularly adolescent behaviors that developmental science and economic theory suggest would be responsive to the new regime and that are known predictors of future health and economic success. We will address this important gap by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the unprecedented large-scale work-focused policy shift known as welfare reform on a range of highly salient social and health behaviors of adolescent children. Using all available and appropriate datasets and both traditional and innovative methods, we will investigate the effects of the work-first regime on anti-social teenage behaviors including crime/delinquency/school behavior problems, as well as pro-social behaviors including participation in school/community activities (volunteerism, religious attendance, clubs/teams) and school effort (e.g., homework), and health compromising behaviors (substance use/abuse), as well as health-promoting behaviors (e.g., healthy eating, exercise, recommended sleep). We will explore heterogeneous effects (e.g., by age of youngest child, child gender, mother's welfare history) and effects of timing and duration of exposure to welfare reform, as well as pathways between welfare reform and behaviors. The proposed research focuses on behaviors that are highly salient for public health and is essential for understanding the effects of the drastically reduced cash assistance safety net on the next generation."

"9216914","Obesity is one of the most prevalent and challenging public health issues of our time. In November 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the use of a new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code for payment in primary care for providing Intensive Behavioral Therapy (IBT) treatment for obese patients. Despite the widespread prevalence of obesity in the Medicare population, use of this benefit has been substantially lower than expected suggesting significant underutilization of this benefit. This exploratory study will pursue the following aims: 1) To develop a thorough understanding of the most pressing issues related to the use and non-use of the Medicare IBT for obesity benefit in primary care, and 2) To study the strategies used in practices that have successfully implemented services in accordance with the IBT for obesity Medicare benefit and describe: a) characteristics of these practices and their environmental context, b) key elements of the implementation process that facilitate successful in-practice intervention, c) patients use of the IBT for obesity benefit, including continuing receipt of services after meeting the weight loss requirement of the benefit, and d) cost to provide the service relative to the reimbursement amount. To accomplish aim 1, we will query the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier database for three states: Colorado, Michigan, and North Carolina and identify all providers and their practices that have been paid by Medicare for delivering IBT for obesity services to 10 or more beneficiaries in a year between 2012 and 2014. We will identify the primary care practices of these providers and conduct semi-structured telephone interviews with the universe of practices (up to 100 total). We will then identify practices that are not using the IBT benefit, matched on zip code, practice size (>5 providers), and family or internal medicine to practices using the benefit and conduct similar interviews with this group. Interviews will assess practice characteristics, reasons for use, non-use and stopping use of the benefit, processes and personnel involved, and any known patient results. To accomplish aim 2, we will purposefully select 36 practices from aim 1 that meet our criteria for IBT for obesity implementation success to collect in- depth information to understand their implementation, patient outcomes and costs. Data gathering will include on-site interviews and observations, and EMR data extraction. Normalization process theory will be used to understand factors important to implementation. These methods will also be used to obtain information to estimate the cost to the practice of providing IBT services and assess its sustainability under current and alternative reimbursement amounts. Our findings have direct policy implications informing the dissemination and sustainability of effective implementation strategies that can be learned from practices continuing to deliver IBT for obesity services. This study will add to the field by determining the use of this benefit, reasons for use and discontinuation of use, and identify potential strategies for effective implementation of IBT in primary care."
"9129195","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-stroke disability represents a significant public health problem. Currently, there are over 7 million stroke survivors in the US, most of whom have persistent disability. Despite the fact that acute stroke treatments dramatically reduce post-stroke disability and are cost saving, they are markedly underutilized. There is no region in the US where acute stroke treatments are more underutilized than in Flint, Michigan. Flint is an urban, underserved city with nearly 100,000 residents of whom about 60% are African American. One of the main reasons for acute stroke treatment underutilization is pre-hospital delay-patients arrive to the hospital too late to receive the treatment. For the past 6 years, the Community Health Partnership-composed of academic partners from the University of Michigan and community partners, Bridges into the Future-has worked to increase acute stroke treatment rates in Flint by decreasing pre-hospital delay. The Community Health Partnership completed several community needs assessments, and from those designed and tested a peer-led, health behavior theory-based intervention in African American churches. The intervention focused on increasing stroke preparedness (i.e., increasing community member's recognition of stroke warning signs and the importance of calling 911 immediately for stroke). This community intervention, Stroke Ready, successfully increased stroke preparedness. The current application represents the larger scale adaption and testing of the Stroke Ready intervention to increase the Flint community's acute stroke treatment rates. Stroke Ready, now expanded to a multi-level intervention, aims to increase acute stroke treatment through both community stroke preparedness and Emergency Department readiness. The Stroke Ready community intervention will adapt and expand the Stroke Ready pilot intervention consisting of interactive workshops and a stroke music video to newly include community-wide education activities such as social media and mass print media. We will also collaborate with a Flint safety-net hospital, where the majority of stroke patients are African American that is in great need of improved acute stroke care, to optimize treatment pathways. The primary outcome of the project will be change in acute stroke treatments, which will directly benefit the entire community by reducing post-stroke disability. Sustainability will be achieved in Flint by training of peer-leaders, wide dissemination of Stroke Ready materials, ease of administering the intervention, hospital improvements and continued commitment and engagement of the Community Advisory Board. The products of this application include a strategy to improve acute stroke treatments in safety-net hospitals and the easy to deliver Stroke Ready community intervention to allow for sustainability and dissemination."
"9132834","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing deployments of electronic health records (EHRs) systems have made massive clinical data available electronically. However, much of detailed clinical information of patients is embedded in narrative text and is not directly accessible for computerized clinical applications. Therefore, natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information in narrative document, have received great attention in the medical domain. Current state-of-the-art NLP approaches often involve building probabilistic models. However, the wide adoption of statistical methods in clinical NLP faces two grand challenges: 1) the lack of large annotated clinical corpora; and 2) the lack of methodologies that can efficiently integrate linguistic and domain knowledge with statistical learning. High-performance statistical NLP methods rely on large scale and high quality annotations of clinical text, but it is time-consuming and costly to create large annotated clinica corpora as it often requires manual review by physicians. Moreover, the medical domain is knowledge intensive. To achieve optimal performance, probabilistic models need to leverage medical domain knowledge. Therefore, methods that can efficiently integrate domain and expert knowledge with machine learning processes to quickly build high-quality probabilistic models with minimum annotation cost would be highly desirable for clinical text processing.    In this study, we propose to investigate interactive machine learning (IML) methods to address the above challenges in clinical NLP. An IML system builds a classification model in an iterative process, which can actively select informative samples for annotation based on models built on previously annotated samples, thus reducing the annotation cost for model development. More importantly, an IML system also involves human inputs to the learning process (e.g., an expert can specify important features for a classification task based on domain knowledge). Thus, IML is an ideal framework for efficiently integrating rule-based (via domain experts specifying features) and statistics-based (via different learning algorithms) approaches to clinical NLP. To achieve our goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we plan to investigate different aspects of IML for word sense disambiguation, including developing new active learning algorithms and conducting cognitive usability analysis for efficient feature annotation by users. To demonstrate the broad uses of IML, we further extend IML approaches to two other important clinical NLP classification tasks: named entity recognition and clinical phenoytping in Aim 2. Finally we propose to disseminate the IML methods and tools to the biomedical research community in Aim 3."
"9150301","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing family of optogenetic tools seeks to control and monitor cellular activity through light. These genetically encoded proteins have revolutionized neuroscience. Recent advances in the field have discovered a new generation of channelrhodopsin tools (CheRiff, ChrimsonR, and Chronos), whose improved properties have allowed the demonstration of all-optical electrophysiology and multicolor stimulation of a cell population. However, the structural basis of these functional gains is unknown. To date, the C1C2 chimera is the only channelrhodopsin (ChR) with a solved crystal structure. To support increasingly challenging experiments in neurobiology and to facilitate the use of optogenetics in other disciplines, improved channelrhodopsin tools are required. To understand the functional advances discovered in the latest generation of ChRs, structural information is required. I propose to solve a new ChR structure to support and guide efforts in protein engineering. A membrane protein structure is a challenging task, but we have several options and opportunities to overcome common obstacles. In parallel, I will use protein recombination to explore the structure-function relationship of the latest generation of ChRs. Guided by structural information,  this SCHEMA method of protein engineering involves swapping blocks of sequence between parental ChRs while minimizing disruption of the tertiary structure. Accurate structural information of a parental ChR will allow for more robust SCHEMA predictions. However, preliminary tests will make use of a homology model (CheRiff model based on C1C2) and a conservative, low- energy chimera library. A representative fraction of this library will be synthesized and transfected into mammalian cells, where several ChR properties will be characterized. This test set will establish links between function and blocks of structure, which will enable modeling and prediction of new block combinations that have desired properties. Throughout the process of recombination we will gain valuable information about structure-function links, and I will produce several functional chimeras. Screening chimeric proteins was a key factor in solving the C1C2 crystal structure, and those chimeras with properties that rival their parents will be added into the structure target pool. Likewise structural information can be used to guide more ambitious chimeragenesis. In this way protein engineering and structural analysis may be used synergistically."
"9197223","PROJECT ABSTRACT The objective of this research is to improve treatment for adults with depression and comorbid cannabis use disorders (CUD) with an innovative, social media-assisted intervention strategy. The proposed intervention combines peer and therapist social network support via Facebook with an integrated, computer-assisted therapy program combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational enhancement therapy (MET) to reduce cannabis use and depressive symptoms. In 2014 the applicant received a NIDA High Priority, Short- Term Project Award to pilot test SHADE (Self-Help for Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Depression), a computerized intervention combining CBT and MET, in a primary psychiatric care setting, where integrated interventions addressing both mental health and substance use disorders (SUDs) are not readily accessible. Preliminary data indicate that integrating SHADE with psychiatric care for depression: (a) is feasible and acceptable, (b) facilitates treatment engagement and retention in a difficult-to-treat comorbid population with major depression and CUD; and (c) produces significant reductions in depressive symptoms and cannabis use. To optimize this model of evidence-based psychotherapy implementation for depressed cannabis users receiving usual care (TAU) in a primary psychiatric setting, the proposed study integrates a social network support component into the SHADE intervention program. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop, with user feedback, a social media-assisted intervention (Connected Cannabis Users? Network for Enhancement of Cognitive Therapy; CONNECT) for depressed cannabis users that combines SHADE with peer and therapist social network support via a private Facebook group for reducing cannabis use and depression, and improving treatment retention; 2) To test, in a pilot RCT (N=50), the incremental efficacy of CONNECT over and above SHADE in improving cannabis use, depression, and healthcare outcomes among depressed adults with CUD in a primary psychiatric setting; 3) To examine whether social network variables moderate or mediate the impact of CONNECT. We hypothesize that SHADE + CONNECT will yield superior clinical outcomes relative to SHADE in reducing cannabis use, improving depressive symptoms and treatment retention, and reducing health service utilization during and after treatment. Moreover, we expect that the social network support component of CONNECT will have a direct effect on the quality and quantity of participants? social support network for addiction and depression recovery, a recognized mechanism of change in CBT and MET approaches to the treatment of comorbid populations, and these changes will be associated with cannabis use and depression outcomes. By providing both clinician and peer support to maximize skills acquisition from SHADE, CONNECT may provide a cost-effective and easily deployable strategy for the treatment of depressed cannabis users in a primary psychiatric care setting, a model that may be extended to other settings where SUDs are undertreated."
"9074409","ABSTRACT  Much remains to be learned about how RAS isoforms differ functionally from each other, and about the impact  of specific mutations on each RAS protein. NRAS-mutant melanoma represents both a critical unmet need in  terms of efficacious therapeutic options and also an outstanding opportunity to elucidate these functional  differences. Although KRAS is the predominant RAS isoform mutated in cancers overall, NRAS is the  predominant RAS isoform mutated in malignant melanoma, and whereas mutations at codon 61 are rare in  KRAS, they predominate in NRAS. Project 2 has recently demonstrated that Nras Q61R but not G12D could  drive melanoma formation in Ink4a-deficient mice. These provocative findings indicate that NRAS Q61R and  G12D must activate distinct effectors, and/or activate effectors in a distinct manner. Given the preferential  occurrence of NRAS Q61 mutations in melanoma, we propose studies to elucidate the signaling mechanisms  that distinguish the roles of Q61- versus G12-mutant NRAS in driving these cancers. We hypothesize that  there are structural, biochemical and biological properties distinct from those of the more common G12-mutant  KRAS proteins found in lung, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas. We have also identified an unexpected  requirement for both KRAS and HRAS WT forms in NRAS-mutant melanomas. We will investigate effector  signaling mechanisms driven by different NRAS mutants, define the requirements for WT isoforms, and  leverage both candidate- and unbiased methodologies to identify targets that can lead to novel combination  therapies for effective treatment of NRAS-driven melanomas. To address our goals, we propose three aims. In  Aim 1, we will elucidate known and unknown effector signaling pathways downstream of cellular NRAS  mutated at codon 61 versus codon 12. This Aim will be performed in close collaboration with Project 2, which  will focus on structural and biochemical differences in the same panel of NRAS mutants. Projects 1 and 4 will  also examine some of the cellular and tumorigenic phenotypes of the same mutations in different RAS  isoforms. In Aim 2, we will characterize the requirement for WT RAS isoforms, and determine functional  differences in effectors and signaling networks, as well as in transformed growth properties. In Aim 3, we will  determine whether the same mechanisms that overcome melanoma addiction to mutant NRAS also overcome  dependency on WT RAS isoforms. To do this, we will first interrogate YAP, known to be capable of rescuing  addiction to mutant KRAS in carcinomas, and we will next perform a novel functional genetic screen to identify  non-YAP mechanisms in an unbiased manner. Collectively, our studies will elucidate a better understanding of  the neglected NRAS isoform, characterize functional distinctions among different NRAS mutations, determine  relationships between WT and mutant NRAS-driven effector signaling pathways and networks, and identify  new directions for novel therapeutic options in NRAS-driven melanoma."
"9173418","DESCRIPTION         Musculoskeletal injuries affect over 28 million patients in the United States each year, in both the civilian and military populations. Analysis of casualty data suggests that a high number of injuries sustained in combat may require restoration of structures such as the flexor tendon, rotator cuff and Achilles tendon. Unfortunately, these structures have a poor healing capacity, thought to be due in part to the large amount of inflammation during the first several weeks following repair. Historically, clinicians have prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) after tendon repair to reduce pain and inflammation but recent studies suggest that these drugs may be detrimental to the healing process. Contrastingly, one study showed improved healing after a delayed delivery of NSAIDs, suggesting that perhaps some inflammation is necessary for beginning the appropriate wound healing cascade but that early and sustained inflammation could be detrimental to tissue remodeling. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the effect of NSAIDs in the early phases of repair on tendon healing by studying both a dose and time dependent delivery of NSAIDs. We hypothesize that local delivery of NSAIDs by release from a microsphere-laden scaffold will have a more pronounced effect on tendon repair mechanical properties than delivery via oral gavage. Additionally, we hypothesize that a late delivery (7-14 days) of the drugs will improve healing while early delivery (0-7 days) will inhibit healing. The hypotheses will be evaluated using a clinically relevant rat model of rotator cuff injury in a degenerative tendon in conjunction with or novel nanofibrous scaffold-microsphere composite delivery system. Assessment of the tensile mechanical properties of the tendons as well as collagen organization, cellularity, cell shape, fibril morphology and the presence of inflammatory cells, could help to deduce the specific mechanisms by which NSAID delivery affects tendon healing. This proposal will specifically address this uncertainty by assessing the delivery of NSAIDs both locally and systemically. Augmentation of the repair combined with concurrent drug delivery in this manner could enhance long-term tendon healing and limit inflammation following rotator cuff repair. In addition, determining a better solution to pain management following musculoskeletal tissue repair, such as delayed NSAID delivery, could help to avoid medications that lead to high morbidity, such as opioids and narcotics."
"9254188","PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropathic pain (NP) conditions affect up to 7-8% of the population, while the annual costs of treatment reach $40 billion in the US. Pain reduction is more difficult to achieve in NP since the mechanisms involved are not the same as the mechanisms of normal, nociceptive pain. Current therapeutic approaches offer limited pain relief and frequently produce side effects that outweigh the benefits. More effective and better tolerated NP treatments are urgently needed. Aptinyx is developing a new approach to addressing NP. The company has developed a novel class of non-toxic, orally bioavailable compounds that modulate the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) within the glutamatergic system. The NMDAR is a major player in regulating synaptic plasticity, which is involved in the development and maintenance of NP. Aptinyx's NMDAR partial agonists presumably act to normalize NMDAR activity by their ability to act as agonists or antagonists. Our preliminary data show that the lead compound, JY-505,317, displays a robust dose-dependent analgesic effect in multiple models of NP, matching or surpassing that of current treatments. Furthermore, its activity is restricted to NP, producing no sedation, and having no effect on nociceptive pain. Initial pharmacological data show excellent safety and bioavailability of JY-505,317, making it an excellent candidate for further development. NMDAR partial agonists previously developed at Aptinyx that JY-505,317 is based on, are currently in clinical development for major depression. The goal of this direct-to-Phase II project is to complete the remaining pre-clinical studies required for JY- 505,317 to advance to human trials for NP. To this end the specific aims are: Aim 1. Evaluate dosing of JY-505,317 in Bennett model of NP. Aim 2. Develop analytical techniques and obtain GMP material of Drug Substance and Drug Product. Aim 3. Conduct 28-day general-toxicology studies in the rat and the dog under GLPs. Aim 4. Conduct pharmacokinetics, safety-pharmacology and genotoxicity studies under GLPs. The end product of the proposed Phase II project is a complete safety package that will be submitted to the FDA as a part of an IND that will allow JY-505,317 to enter clinical trials."
"9083227","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interaction of ions with biomolecules enable many physiological processes. In most cases, ions interact directly with biomolecules and after shedding, at least partially, their inner-shell waters. Consequently, mechanistic insights require a precise knowledge of how the energetics/structures/dynamics of ion-binding differ between hydrated and biomolecule-bound states. While ?rst principles quantum mechanical models can yield reliable estimates for relative binding energies, estimates for thermodynamics and ion-binding response are subject to limitations from conformational sampling and system size. In contrast, non-polarizable models can technically get past sampling/system-size issues, but they suffer severely from accuracy. Polarizable models do offer a long term sustainable compromise, but there is now clear evidence that errors in such models are far from the desired < 1 kcal/mol target. Nevertheless, a series of recent studies provide encouraging results that can be used to build upon the foundational work and enhance reliability signi?cantly. While the errors in all popular polarizable models are large, they are, at least for the cases examined, systematic. Furthermore, there are at least two short-ranged electronic effects that are not included in polarizable models, and whose contributions are substantial and correlated with transferability errors: (i) redistribution of charge between the ion and its coordinating ligands, which is synonymous with charge-penetration, but accounts for variations in the chemistry of the ligand as a whole rather than its ion-coordinating functional group; (ii) distance-dependent variation in ligand C6 dispersion coef?cients. This study will essentially tests the hypothesis that the transferability issue can be resolved by introducing these two short-ranged electronic effects in polarizable models, and in a manner that does not require a re-tuning of existing parameters. Achieving these goals and incorporating these effects into polarizable models of amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids will require determination of their speci?c contributions, which will be  accomplished through a hierarchy of ?rst principles quantum mechanical approaches including CCSD(T), SAPT, DMC and DFT+vdW (Aim 1). This study will also reveal the roles of other electronic effects. Additionally, it will require implementation and validation of a general approach to incorporate these effects in polarizable models (Aim 2). The systematic quantum study will generate high-level reference data and improve understanding of ion-ligand interactions. The new approach will impact the nature of molecular mechanics models for a broad spectrum of chemical functionalities other than ions, including nucleotides, charged lipids and charged amino acids. Models capable of capturing local response properties will also ?nd use in enhanced sampling approaches where transferability is essential for a more faithful representation. This work will produce new versions of two widely used simulations packages and validated versions of two polarizable models for ef?cient and accurate simulations of biological ionic interactions."
"9102801","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the U.S. is concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID). Increasing reports of HCV including outbreaks of HCV in young adult PWID in non-urban locales have prompted concerns about an expanding epidemic. Several investigations suggest that that these spikes in HCV infection are linked to sharp increases in prescription opiate use that has been trending in the U.S, and which have resulted in young adults transitioning from prescription opiates to injection use, particularly heroin. Young adult PWID in non-urban areas may be at increased risk of infection, from the combination of high viral infectivity and high prevalence of HCV in injecting groups, together with a lack of knowledge regarding infection routes and effective prevention. New Mexico is one of the states leading recorded increases in HCV in young adults, ranking 2nd in the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP), Hepatitis Surveillance Demonstration Sites project, in 2011 for the number and rate of HCV cases reported. Heroin, prescription opioids, and other drugs are also accounting for this state having one of the highest overdose rates in the country. Between October 2013 and March 2014, the New Mexico Department of Health recorded 211 cases of HCV among young adults in a pilot surveillance study, demonstrating the gravity of the problem. To address the need for prevention, care and treatment services against HCV in this population, we propose epidemiological and service uptake research in two regions of New Mexico where young adult PWID have been impacted by drug use and HCV. We will initiate a prospective cohort study of young adult non-urban PWID who will be recruited and followed in two health regions of New Mexico (the South West and North East) to: (1) gather epidemiologic data on risk behaviors, drug use patterns, injection networks, prevention needs, and health service utilization; (2) to refer young adult PWID to HCV care services, as well as other prevention and treatment opportunities including harm reduction and drug treatment, and assess rates of successful linkage, including the  cascade of care; (3) to examine factors that may contribute to non-treatment, poor adherence, and failure to achieve SVR among young adult PWID with chronic HCV infection; and (4) assess reinfection events among young adult PWID who are treated for HCV and achieve SVR. Our proposal, which we refer to in this application as New Mexico H-TIPS, will also include testing and referrals for HIV and HBV co-infections as well. A collaborative group of public health and clinical specialists linked with a strong prevention and clinical service infrastructure in New Mexico will ensure successful implementation of this research. Results from this proposed research will impact a diverse young population disproportionately at risk for HCV and reduce health disparities in a region highly impacted by drug use and HCV."
"9204322","The incredible diversity and abundance of the human microbiome has only come to light in the last decade. The scientific community has learned that the gut microbial ecosystem has a major role in the development and homeostasis of the immune system. Our team wants to learn how these systems communicate to shape HIV vaccine immune responses. We are interested in how the microbiome shapes immune responses to HIV vaccines and contributes to vaccine response heterogeneity. We have a special emphasis on investigating the durability and class of antibodies that are elicited by different vaccines and the cellular responses that may contribute to these humoral endpoints, and how specific microbiota may contribute to these different responses. We will conduct correlates analyses with clinical and mouse microbiome and immunogenicity data; we will unravel mechanisms of immunity by perturbation of the immune system and the microbiome ? the immune system via multiple adjuvanted immunization regimens and the microbiome by gut microbial reconstitution in germ free mice; and we will conduct metabolomics case-control analyses from select human and mouse samples. The knowledge gained in the end will shed light on the mechanisms of how vaccines work and may improve vaccines by way of novel adjuvant discovery."

"9272159","Abstract  Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) describes cognitive impairment resulting from cerebrovascular disease or dysfunction. VCID is a frequent co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as a single dementia-causing entity. The most common vasculopathy associated with cognitive impairment is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). It is highly likely that SVD significantly contributes to the clinical manifestation of dementia, and therefore is a viable target for disease-modifying therapies, whether alone or in combination with AD-targeting therapies. One major obstacle for therapeutic development is the lack of biomarkers that are predictive of the presence and course of SVD-VCID. In this proposal we present candidate biomarkers for SV-VCID that will contribute to the consortium.  We have identified MRI imaging modalities of 3D FLAIR, ASL, and DTI as our imaging candidate biomarkers. We have also identified IL-12 p70, TNF?, PIGF and VEGFD as our candidate fluid biomarkers that discriminate SVD well in the subset of our cohort that we have analyzed. In this application we have a plan for developing our candidate biomarkers and validating them through the UH2 phase an individual research group, and also through the UH3 part as a member of the consortium. In addition, we bring significant strengths that will help synergize and move the consortium as a whole forward in our collective goal of developing biomarkers that are ready for large scale clinical trials and FDA qualification in years 6-7 of the consortium. These strengths include a well characterized, longitudinal cohort supported through our ADC and other NIH initiatives, our long history of active participation in consortia providing the experience and infrastructure needed to ensure success in this UH2/UH3 mechanism, our history of data sharing, resource sharing including samples, recruitment of research participants for longitudinal studies, and our foundation in basic and translational science."
"9136077","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) has the opportunity to expand upon a recent pilot study conducted in conjunction with team members from University of Rochester and their subcontractors at Google[X] and Answer Informatics working with a social media monitoring software (SoMMS) entitled nEmesis. The software nEmesis identifies tweets suggestive of foodborne illness by following a user for up to two weeks after the user posts from a food establishment. The nEmesis software then assigns a score to the food establishment based on the quantity and severity of sick tweets. In the pilot program, researchers are observing whether restaurants with high scores also tended to have worse health inspection outcomes as compared to blind assigned controls.  In the proposed research, SNHD plans to expand the software by incorporating existing foodborne illness data, including foodborne illness complaints and customer's sanitation complaints, into the software and allowing it to influence the score. The score will then be used as a tool to determine when and where a regulatory response is needed such as a routine inspection, or an epidemiological investigation, depending on the severity.  By using this novel technology, SNHD will potentially be able to identify cases of unreported foodborne illness faster and investigate cases and potential outbreaks quickly resulting in the reduced spread of disease in the community. Furthermore, if the intervention of unifying the nEmesis software with other foodborne illness predictors is able to identify foodborne illness outbreaks more quickly, less valuable time will need to be spent in the field investigating foodborne illness concerns.  In the proposed research study, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on foodborne illness in the community by monitoring rates of lab?confirmed salmonellosis and E. coli O157:H7, quantity of foodborne illness reports, and quantity of customer complaints on restaurant sanitation. Secondly, SNHD will evaluate whether the intervention has an effect on time spent investigating verified foodborne illness complaints and verified customer sanitation complaints. This data will be collected over the life of the research and then compared to baseline data and analyzed for differences."
"9202636","Abstract Neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson?s disease, dementia, spina bifida, diabetes, stroke, and spinal cord injury (SCI), can result in loss of voluntary voiding of urine and require intermittent bladder catheterization for voiding. Catheter use is associated with increased incidence of health problems, predominately repeated urinary tract infections, sepsis, urethral trauma and hospitalization. Dignify Therapeutics is developing a novel drug treatment, DTI-100, to provide an ?on-demand, rapid-onset, short-duration, drug-induced, voiding therapy? for those who cannot void voluntarily. Results from our STTR Phase I grant award demonstrated that both intranasal (IN) solutions and sublingual orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) that contain DTI-100 exhibit pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics that support additional studies to select between these two formulations for subsequent clinical development. Although both formulations induced voiding in rats, ODT dosing was not as potent or effective as IN dosing, presumably due to the highly keratinized oral mucosa of the rat compared to other species. Because of this, and because a ?non-rodent? species is required for use in safety studies prior to entering clinical trials, this STTR Phase II application proposes to evaluate IN and sublingual ODT formulations in rabbits and dogs, two species which are acceptable to the FDA for safety studies. The ultimate goal of this application is to pick a ?final formulation? for pharmaceutical development and select a suitable species for preclinical safety studies to enable our IND application to the FDA. In Phase II, DTI-100 will be administered to rabbits and dogs using the most promising formulations from our Phase I rat studies to compare PK and PD responses across species. Specific Aim (SA) 1 will complete one- year formulation stability tests that were initiated in Phase I. Formulation optimization by modification of excipients is also performed in SA1 if results with Phase I formulations in rabbits and dogs are inferior to those from rats. SA2 compares the IN and ODT formulations for PK profile and PD effects (isovolumetric pressure recording and voiding cystometry) in acute spinal and spinal intact, anesthetized rabbits. SA3 compares IN and ODT formulations for PK and PD effects in dogs. Voiding parameters are measured in anesthetized (isovolumetric pressure recording and voiding cystometry) and conscious (voiding onset and duration, voided volume, voiding efficiency) dogs. Based on their respective abilities to best meet the PK and PD of our ?ideal? target product profile, an IN or ODT formulation will be selected and used for subsequent IND-enabling preclinical safety studies."
"9358104","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural crest cells (NC cells) are essential to establishing the vertebrate body plan, contributing many critical cell types. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control the formation and development of these cells is of high importance to understanding congenital defects, and for regenerative medicine. Moreover, several of the proteins upon which this proposal centers have clear and established links to the formation of tumor initiating cells (aka Cancer Stem Cells) and metastasis. By further elucidating the mechanisms by which these proteins regulate the normal development of NC and pluripotent blastula/ES cells, we will gain further insight into their role in NC derived tumors, ad in stemness, malignant transformation and invasive cell behavior more generally. We have previously identified factors underlying NC cell potency, including Myc and Id3. The work proposed here is potentially paradigm shifting as it presents and tests a novel hypothesis for the origins of NC cells and their relationship to pluripotent blastula/inner cell mass cells. We propose that a regulatory network supporting pluripotency in the blastula ectoderm is at least partially retained in select cells through gastrulation, and by neurula stage these cells are located at the neural plate border, and become NC cells by virtue of their retained potency. We also dissect regulatory targets of key potency factors, and test the hypothesis that Snail proteins, key regulators of NC, ES and cancer stem cells, are context dependent factors that both activate and repress key target genes. The proposed aims will significantly advance our understanding of an important cell type, and provide a new framework with which to understand their origins and stem cell attributes. This work has high potential to drive novel approaches to stem cell bases therapies, as well as cancer diagnostics/ therapeutics"
"9152369","Project Summary  Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that kills tens of thousands of individuals each year in the United States alone. It is adept at acquiring resistance to antibiotics, exemplified by the methicillin- resistant strains better known as MRSA. Moreover, MRSA is now present in both the hospital and community settings, with MRSA isolates in the latter possessing enhanced virulence properties and afflicting healthy individuals. Meanwhile, the pipeline for new antibiotics against S. aureus has dwindled, creating the urgent need to characterize new druggable targets. One such target is the recently discovered ABC transporter Pmt, which is responsible for the secretion of an important class of staphylococcal exotoxins, the PSMs. PSMs undermine the mechanisms of the innate immune system and help disperse bacteria from biofilm communities, contributing to disseminated disease. However, PSMs are too diverse to target directly with a single agent. Therefore, Pmt provides an alternative target, and blocking Pmt would blunt PSM-associated virulence with the additional potential to be bactericidal due to PSMs accumulating within MRSA. The primary goal of this project is to advance Pmt as a drug target with specific aims to gain fundamental biochemical knowledge of how Pmt secretes PSMs?critical for rationally targeting Pmt?and to establish the technical platforms to exploit Pmt as a drug target."

Boozman College of Public Health (COPH) and community partners with a reconfigured structure of a consortium between these three entities. The 5-year goal is to: develop the research, partnerships, educational, and communication/dissemination infrastructure in collaborative consortium consisting of ADH practitioners, COPH faculty, and key community partners to develop and implement a core research project to address a scalable approach to enhancing HTN control; develop public health practice capacity; enhance a history of collaboration; and participate actively in the PRC Network. The Mission is to: develop research and educational programs to enhance public health practice in order to reduce risks for chronic diseases among those who bear the greatest risk in the state, Arkansas' racial and ethnic minorities, with a goal of eliminating chronic disease health disparities. To achieve this Mission, the Center will develop  core infrastructure, including: a Director's Office (DO) and Executive Committee (EC) to manage the daily administrative matters; a Partner Advisory Committee (PAC) of state health leaders to provide feedback and assist in sustaining cost- effective findings; a Steering Committee (SC) with all members of the EC, core unit members, and Research Project PI/Co-PIs to establish ARPRC priorities; a Community Committee (CC) with members representing diverse leaders of Desha County, the proposed research project site to advise both the DO and the Research project team about implementing the research project; a Community Engagement, Partnerships and Technical Assistance Unit (CEPTAU), building on the existing the COPH and ADH collaborations (particularly the existing Joint Advisory Council - JAC) for technical assistance (TA) initiatives and to develop the CC; a Communication and Dissemination Unit (CDU) to establish a communication plan to integrate and promote all center core activities and translate research, and to develop and implement a community media HTN campaign for the Research Project; and a Training Unit (TU) to develop a 5-year comprehensive training plan for identified training needs to strengthen capacity of health practitioners, students, community members, and partner organizations to provide TA, improve applied public health research and practice.  In addition, the major research focus of this application is identifying cost-effective methods of better controlling hypertension (HTN), a leading, relatively easily controllable risk factor for a variety of diseases which are leading sources of morbidity and mortality, particularly in Arkansas where uncontrolled HTN (u-HTN) is exceedingly high. HTN control is a major ADH priority, and public health practice approaches to enhance HTN treatment via cost-effective methods are likely scalable and sustainable if they can be integrated in the rapid health care reform occurring  in Arkansas, providing a model for other sectors of the nation."
"9070504","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Very few commonly used neonatal surgical therapies have been evaluated to determine their safety. Premature infants are especially vulnerable to unrecognized treatment hazards. Inguinal hernia (IH) repair is the most commonly performed major operation in premature infants, is associated with a 30-40% morbidity rate, and it is unknown whether the operation should occur prior to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge or be delayed. Early IH repair possibly increases anesthesia and cardiorespiratory serious adverse events (SAEs), whereas delayed IH repair possibly increases hernia-related adverse events. A growing concern is the possibility that early general anesthesia exposure impairs neurodevelopment. The randomized clinical trial (RCT) proposed will be the first trial to evaluate the effect of timing of general anesthesia exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our objective is to conduct a 19 center RCT to determine whether early IH repair (prior to NICU discharge) or late IH repair (~5 months after NICU discharge) is the safer surgical approach for premature infants who are diagnosed with an inguinal hernia while in the NICU. Assuming a 60% randomization rate, which is supported from a feasibility pilot RCT, 651 infants will be randomly assigned to early or late IH repair over a 2.5-year period. The primary hypothesis is that late IH repair is safer as defined by a 10% absolute reduction in the proportion of infants with >1 SAE (relative risk = 0.66; number needed to harm of 10 for early repair) within 10 months after enrollment. The primary outcome, as adjudicated by a committee masked to treatment group assignment, is the proportion of infants with >1 SAE during the study period. Secondary outcome measures include the number of hospital days during the study period (hypothesis: median 3 days less with late IH repair) and, in selected centers (n=200 infants), neurodevelopmental testing with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), 3rd edition, at 2 years corrected age (hypothesis: 0.4SD higher Cognitive Composite score with late IH repair). We will also measure non-routine events during the IH repair operation, which may underlie SAEs. The potential differences in treatment effect according to pre-specified patient characteristics (at enrollment) will be examined by frequentist and conservative Bayesian methods. The trial is utilizing the Pediatric Surgery Research Collaborative, a cooperative group committed to performing prospective clinical studies in pediatric surgery. Successful completion of the RCT proposed will stimulate future safety studies within neonatal surgery."
"9131854","Our goal is to understand how the brain accomplishes visual object recognition. Evidence obtained under this grant and from other labs suggests that each visual image is processed along the ventral visual cortical process- ing stream into a new pattern of neural activity at its top level -- the inferior temporal cortex (IT) -- that con- veys explicit information about object identity, even in the face of substantial view uncertainty (?invariance?). That IT population representation is thought to be causally responsible for object recognition. But precisely how does the IT population account for a seemingly in?nite number of object discriminations? What are the behaviorally critical ?features? conveyed by IT? How many? How can they be described? Here we aim to build and test image-to-IT-to-behavior models that are predictively accurate over the entire domain of core visual object recognition behavior. Substantial prior work argues that we should start by test- ing and developing the IT 100.1f model family: all models in that family state that IT conveys ~100, image- computable ?features? in its activity sampled at ~1 mm scale. How can we test and develop such models? First, this model family predicts that we can build and provide a single, low dimensional (<100) Euclidean em- bedding space to predict all basic and subordinate level object discrimination tasks (Aim 1). Second, the model family predicts that we can discover the particular aspects of IT activity (called IT ?features?) as those that, when weighted and summed, exactly predict behavioral object confusion of every image (Aim 2a). Third, the model family predicts that temporary suppression of individual, mm-scale portions of IT cortex will produce reliable, predictable patterns of behavioral disruption across all basic-level and subordinate level object tasks (Aim 3). Fourth, the model family posits that differences in IT neural tuning functions at spatial scales less than ~1 mm are irrelevant for core object discrimination behavior ? a prediction we will test with both record- ing (Aim 2a) and neural perturbation (Aim 3) experiments. Finally, the model family motivates our goal (Aim 2b) of characterizing the complete set of ~100 IT features with image-computable functions and with human shape adjectives. While substantial preliminary data support these predictions and goals, a complete model has not yet been built or tested. If these aims are accomplished, this work would transform our understanding by showing pre- cisely how core object recognition is causally accounted for at the level of IT cortex, and by providing a model that would accurately predict how any image manipulation or direct IT neural intervention would alter any core object recognition behavior."
"9255385","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  One in 16 Black men will be diagnosed with HIV in his lifetime as compared to 1 in 102 White men. Nearly 15% of these new HIV cases among African American men are due to heterosexual transmission. Despite this, Black men who have sex with women (MSW) have received very little empirical attention. This is a missed public health opportunity. First, Black men do not routinely use condoms, one of the most effective ways to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV, indicating the potential for substantial behavioral impact. And second, 80% of new HIV infections in African American women are due to sex with men. The intra-racial nature of sexual networks suggests most of these women are infected by Black men. Thus, reducing HIV incidence among Black men should concomitantly reduce HIV disparities among African American women.  The female condom (FC) is an alternative HIV protection method that may overcome a key barrier to male condom use: reduced sexual pleasure. Research shows that Black women respond well to FC education, but gender norms may impede their efforts to introduce FCs to male partners. One way to overcome this is to provide FC training directly to men. Indeed, preliminary research has shown that men report fewer unprotected sex partners after receiving both female and male condom training. In addition, men endorse several benefits to FC use, including that they provide greater sexual sensation than male condoms.  To harness the potential of FCs for Black MSW, we intend to develop Focus, a computer-based HIV behavioral intervention for heterosexually active African American men that provides training in male and female condom use. Focus will computer-enable the core components of Focus on the Future (FOF), the only best-evidence HIV behavioral intervention for Black MSW. The one-hour FOF session addresses the correct and consistent use of male condoms and lubricants, condom negotiation, and the importance of protecting one's future. FOF's main message is that there are many types of condoms and lubricants and men should experiment to find the ones that make sex feel best. By providing FCs as an additional option, Focus aims to lessen the impact of a major barrier to condom uptake: reduced sexual pleasure. Another barrier to Black MSW's HIV risk reduction behavior is belief in a traditional masculine ideology. Black men who espouse these views are more likely to engage in sexual risk behavior. To counteract this, Focus will provide methods to reframe potentially dangerous masculine beliefs into healthier sexual and relationship behaviors.  The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of Focus, far exceeding the established benchmarks. In Phase II, we will complete development of Focus and test its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial with 120 African American MSW. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive the Focus program or the attention control materials. Before, and at two points after random assignment, condom use behaviors as well as condom skills, attitudes, and partner negotiation will be assessed."
"9144810","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cornea, our window to the world, is subject to damage caused by injury, infection and other diseases. Approaches are being developed to treat these corneas by transplantation of cornea epithelial stem cells. A major medical challenge lies in being able to isolate sufficient quantities of these cells for culture, expansion, and transplantation. We still lack a basic understanding of their proliferation, migratory behaviors and precise markers to identify these cells. We also do not know what factors regulate these behaviors, which is essential for enhancing the therapeutic potential of cornea epithelial stem cells. Recent evidence suggests that cutaneous nerves may be a key component of the epithelial stem cell niche. The frog Xenopus is an established vertebrate model with distinct advantages for studies of cell and molecular biology. The development and morphology of the mature frog cornea is essentially identical to that of humans. We developed tools that make Xenopus an excellent system to study the biology of these cells. Our central hypotheses are that limbal stem cells and their proliferative progeny exhibit specific cleavage patterns and express specific combinations of genes that will allow one to distinguish these cells. Further, these cells respond to cues released by damage to undergo increased proliferation, being able to migrate to wound sites, and finally that nerves serving the cornea represent a critical component of the epithelial stem cell niche that regulates the behavior of these cells. This proposal has three specific aims to address these hypotheses: I) determine the normal proliferative patterns and gene expression profiles to distinguish these stem cells and their progeny, and examine the role of pluripotency genes in regulating the behavior of these cells. II) Determine how these cells respond to damage and whether they undergo active migration during homeostasis and repair. III). Determine if cutaneous nerves of the cornea play a key role in supporting these proliferative cells. To address these aims we developed new tools that permit direct, continuous visualization of these cells in live animals over prolonged periods of time. We have also developed Xenopus models to study cornea wound repair and limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Finally, we can ligate the corneal nerves with tremendous precision to test their role in supporting these cells. This research is innovative in its use of high-throughpu transgenic approaches in Xenopus to permit real-time observations of live cornea epithelial stem cells in which we can characterize specific patterns of gene expression (markers) that identify these cells. This study will also determine if corneal nerves represent a critical component of the stem cell niche that supports these cells. Tens of thousands of patients develop neurotrophic keratitis, forms of corneal dystrophy, LSCD, and other eye conditions annually in the U.S. that require corneal transplants (about 40,000/year). The proposed research is significant, as it will develop tools and approaches that can be used to treat these diseases and injuries of the cornea."
"9179475","Project Summary-Abstract Preeclampsia (PE) remains a major health concern, affecting 5-10% of all pregnancies in the United States. It is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. While the underlying mechanisms are not clear, it is believed that inadequate remodeling of the maternal vasculature leads to placental hypo-perfusion, resulting in chronic placental hypoxia/ischemia. In response the placenta releases pathogenic factors into the maternal blood stream, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. In recent years, a great deal of attention has focused on the role of altered immune function in the pathogenesis of PE. Chronic activation of immune mechanisms is associated with PE as preeclamptic women have an imbalance among CD4+ T lymphocytes (?TRegs ?TH17), increased cytolytic natural killer (NK) cells, and chronic systemic inflammation. These factors are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of PE; however, the stimulus for the increased cytolytic NK cell number and function during PE has yet to be clearly defined. Furthermore, the significance of the cytolytic NK cells in the development of PE and hypertension has not been previously investigated. Natural killer cells make up 10% of lymphocytes in human peripheral blood and are identified by their expression of CD56 in the absence of CD3. NK cells function to provide front line defense against viral infections and malignantly transformed cells. NK cells can differentiate into two distinct subsets, type 1 (NK1) or type 2 (NK2). The NK1 subset is characterized by its release of IFN? and potent cytolytic activity upon activation whiel the NK2 subset is characterized by their release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IL- 13 and a decrease in their cytolytic activity. Decidual natural killer cells make up 70-90% of the uterine leukocytes and are the most abundant maternal leukocyte population during the first trimester in human pregnancy. The main population of uterine NK (uNK) cells consists of the NK2 subset and these cells are thought to have multiple roles in human pregnancy. Preeclampsia is associated with a shift in the NK cell population from NK2 to NK1 (Type 1 shift); and previous investigators have suggested an important role for TH17s and IL-17, to activate the cytolytic function of NK cells in vitro. This proposal will explore the role of ?TH17s as regulators of cytolytic NK cells during placental ischemia. I will further explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate cytolytic NK cell activity. Finally, I propose to manipulation of the cytolytic NK cell population or manipulation of the factors that mediate cytolytic NK cell activation will attenuate the development of hypertension and intrauterine growth restriction, suggesting new therapeutic approaches for the management of preeclampsia. In order to test these hypotheses, a number of in vitro and in vivo approaches will be used."
"9147117","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Hazardous compounds in waters and soils are subject to a complex, dynamic web of interactions among physical, chemical and biological constituents in the natural environment. Computational modeling has been proven indispensable to hazardous substances remediation, particularly integrated modeling of pollutant hydrogeological fate and transport. For the first time, however, advances in molecular-scale characterization have enabled new possibilities for more precise, realistic and truly predictive models for pollutant remediation. Specifically, simulations of complex microbial ecosystems (microbiomes) associated with contaminant transformation hold great promise to direct the development of a new generation of more cost effective and reliable bioremediation solutions for a range of compounds and contaminated sites. This Phase I project aims to develop a new computational platform with the ability to predict key dynamics of natural bioremediation processes, and to leverage that information to better design remedial technologies for environmental restoration. The basis of our platform is an approach called agent-based modeling, where the behavior of individual components within complex ecosystems can calculate systems-level properties. Compared with existing computational modeling approaches, our agent-based modeling approach provides the ability to capture individual heterogeneity within complex environments, balance spatial detail with computational efficiency, and predict non-linear behaviors and kinetics across a range of spatial and temporal dynamics associated with environmental sites. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to leverage molecular and biochemical-scale parameterization to remedy the major deficiencies associated with conventional simulation approaches for pollutant biodegradation, which are often mean-field models and fitted to environmental site data. This multi-scale platform will be built, integrated and validated in an iterative fashion using microcosm studies of a contaminated environmental site. In this way, this project is designed to both contribute to increased scientifi understanding of microbiome functions in natural environments, as well as inform strategies to help further public health and environmental safety. The major outcome of this work will be a proof-of-concept of a novel, integrated and multi-scale agent-based platform for predicting the functional dynamics of environmental bioremediation. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging contemporary bioinformatics tools and databases to develop more precise, reliable and inexpensive approaches for environmental remediation. Compared with existing methods and computational models, the successful outcome of this project stands to provide benefits to a range of stakeholders, including Superfund site managers, government agencies, engineering and consulting firms, and most importantly, populations impacted by the presence of hazardous substances in their communities."

These data include all available nematode genomic data (such as genome sequence, transcripts and cis-regulatory sites prioritized by species), large-scale functional genomic datasets, the function and interactions of genes and gene products as they relate to development, physiology and behavior, and biological reagents and their source information. WormBase comprises a set of databases storing a wide range of biological information; a website that allows users to access stored information and precomputed analyses based on these data; and tools for programmatic access such as an application programming interface, a data mining platform, and bulk downloads. Curation activities include extraction and integration of information from the literature (assisted by the use of information retrieval tools), incorporation of large-scale datasets from a range of research projects, and gene model verification from experimental data. We will curate hundreds of nematode genome sequences, annotations and core genetic information as well as data on gene function, pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks for C. elegans and select other species. We will expand tools available for data mining, workflow management, visualization, and community annotation, and integrate, store and distribute data in a maintainable, interoperable and scalable system. The project team involves three sites: Caltech primarily curates functional information; EBI carries out sequence-based curation and builds databases for public release; and OICR develops and supports the web presence and visualization. The three sites work closely together and share tasks to ensure timely incorporation, storage and display of information.         RELEVANCE Nematodes (roundworms) are major parasites of humans, livestock and crops, and understanding how to control them is a major world health and economic challenge. One species of nematode, C. elegans, is extensively used for basic biomedical research to elucidate how networks of genes affect cells, organs and a whole animal's development, physiology and behavior. WormBase collects, stores and displays information about the genomes and genes of C. elegans and other nematodes to facilitate research about this numerous and important group of animals."
"9202126","PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol addiction and disorders associated to excessive alcohol use are a serious public health problem in the United States and in other parts of the world. Current pharmacotherapies for the treatment of these disorders show limited efficacy. Preclinical and clinical findings point to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) as an alternative, promising target for the development of novel and effective medications. However, it is unclear which specific nAChR subtypes serve as mediators of the rewarding effects of alcohol due, in part, to the complexity of the different possible combinations of the subunits that compose nAChRs and the lack of potent and selective ligands. Using combinatorial libraries, scaffold ranking and position scanning strategies, Assuage Pharmaceuticals, in collaboration with Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies has discovered new scaffolds that have produced high affinity nAChR antagonists with exquisite selectivity for ?4?2 nAChRs over ?3?4 nAChRs, with respect to both binding affinity and in vitro functional activity. When tested in rats, one lead compound, TPI-202 as well as varenicline (a partial agonist of ?4?2 nAChRs), but not ?3?4 nAChR directed ligands, attenuated both alcohol- and nicotine-taking behaviors in a paradigm in which the two reinforcers were concurrently available. The ?3?4 nAChR directed ligands were only effective in reducing nicotine self- administration. These initial findings led us to hypothesize that ?4?2 nAChRs may serve as a viable target for developing pharmacotherapies to treat alcohol dependence. To verify this hypothesis, here we propose to use the Assuage compounds to examine whether novel, high affinity and selective ?4?2 nAChR antagonists are effective in reducing important aspects of alcohol addiction including excessive alcohol intake and vulnerability to relapse. To accomplish this objective two specific aims have been proposed. The purpose of Specific Aim 1 is to (A) re-synthesize selective ?4?2 nAChR compounds (TPI-202, -211, -412, and -421) and (B) determine in vitro functional activities prior to in vivo testing. Specific Aim 2 is aimed at testing the in vivo efficacy of these compounds. It will determine whether the selective ?4?2 antagonists block (A) both operant and excessive home cage alcohol drinking and (B) relapse into alcohol seeking as assessed by both cue-induced and stress- induced reinstatement paradigms. We expect this multidisciplinary proposal to identify novel pharmacological tools that can be optimized in a future Phase II application, and ultimately to be used as medications for excessive alcohol use and dependence."

"9272132","Project Summary/Abstract Lewy body disorders include Parkinson?s Disease Dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). DLB is particularly problematic since it is often not appreciated until late stages, and often is admixed pathologically with concomitant Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Clinical care and the design of symptomatic and disease modifying trials for DLB would benefit from earlier diagnosis and reduced pathological heterogeneity. Thus, it is important to identify the extent to which Lewy Body versus AD pathology contributes to the phenotype and underlying biology of DLB, and to discover new molecular targets that specific to DLB. Clinically, we are uniquely poised to recruit a multiethnic cohort of DLB patients derived from both the local /metropolitan community, the Alzheimer?s Disease Research Center [ADRC], and the broader practice settings of the Aging and Dementia, Movement Disorders, and primary care programs at Columbia University. We will capture the continuum of cognitive impairment and extrapyramidal signs that exist in DLB. In Aim 1, we will identify and recruit an ethnically diverse (White, Hispanic, African American) cohort of 40 DLB patients per year for years 1-4, who will be followed semi-annually. We will administer the NINDS Parkinson?s Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) battery, the NIA National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) UDS3 with the new DLB module. In Aim 2, we will perform RNA gene expression and epigenetic (DNA methylation) profiling on dissected brain tissue from our Columbia University brain bank including cases with pathologically defined Lewy Body Disease with AD pathology (DLB/AD) and without significant AD (DLB), cases with AD, and controls to identify Lewy body specific differences primarily by comparing DLB/AD and AD. In Aim 3, we will use expression data from Aim 2, to develop biomarker assays in blood and CSF, including at RNA and protein levels. This aim will first utilize plasma from cases who have autopsy proven diagnosis, and will then be expanded to samples with clinical diagnoses."
"9358746","ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish a Coordinating Center (CC) for the next phase of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) sponsored by the NIH. The objective of ATN is to increase awareness among at-risk youth of their HIV status and, for those with HIV, achieve linkage, engagement and retention in the care continuum. Many challenges are faced by adolescents during their transition to young adulthood, resulting from developmental changes, peer influences, identity, and self-esteem formation. Risky behaviors among adolescents, which include engaging in unprotected sexual encounters or sharing nonsterile injecting drug paraphernalia, increase their likelihood of acquiring HIV infection. In the 2013 US Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBSS), 34% of US high school students reported sexual intercourse during the prior 3 months, of which only 59% indicated condom use during last sexual intercourse. The YRBSS also found that only 13% of students had ever been tested for HIV infection. Given the global burden of new HIV infections among young people, greater involvement of adolescents in biomedical and behavioral HIV research is essential. However, significant individual, operational, and community-level barriers have been recognized to engaging adolescents in clinical prevention trials, which include insufficient understanding of research, need for parental consent, lack of access, mistrust and stigma associated with research participation. The new ATN is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating U19 investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for ATN projects. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies, comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include ATN information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to ATN by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the ATN. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for collaboration and extraordinary research productivity from protocol development through research data sharing."
"9230005","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Together, physical inactivity and poor diet make up the second leading modifiable cause of death in the US. Racial disparities in these behaviors and associated health outcomes present major public health challenges. The specific aims of the USC PRC for 2014-2019 build on a long and successful history of applied research and practice in underserved communities: 1) grow the Center infrastructure; 2) engage communities, state and local health departments, and other stakeholders to inform our activities; 3) implement an integrated set of strategies to disseminate Center research findings, products, and programs; 4) contribute to the development of skilled community members and public health professionals through training and technical assistance; 5) evaluate Center activities and outcomes; and 6) conduct an applied public health prevention research project. Achievement of these aims will lead to the following long-term outcomes: 1) increased translation of research into practice and policy; 2) improved environmental and system-wide strategies; 3) widespread use of evidence-based programs and policies; 4) enhanced community capacity for health promotion and disease prevention; 5) increased skilled public health professionals and community members; 6) expanded resources for applied public health research; and 7) increased recognition of and support for USC PRC research and activities. The USC PRC's applied research project will study the dissemination and implementation of an evidence-based program shown previously to significantly increase physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in churches in South Carolina (Faith, Activity, and Nutrition; FAN). Guided by two theoretical frameworks, the specific aims of the applied research project are to: 1) examine the adoption and reach of FAN in churches and organizational factors associated with adoption; 2) characterize implementation fidelity and multilevel factors associated with implementation; 3) describe organizational maintenance of FAN and factors associated with maintenance; and 4) study the effectiveness of FAN. In Phase 1, we will randomize churches in a rural county with a high proportion of African American residents to receive training in FAN from a community health advisor (n=40) or to be part of a delayed intervention control group (n=20). This phase will allow us to study dissemination and implementation in a range of diverse religious denominations and gain greater understanding of how local coalitions can reach faith-based communities as settings for intervention. In Phase 2, we will work with two large faith denominations in SC, including one that is predominantly African American, to disseminate the program statewide. This phase will allow us to identify key considerations in program dissemination, adoption, and implementation and to examine the potential for broader geographic dissemination. Increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption are important goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles and the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's environmental approach to preventing chronic disease and promoting health."

"9042916","With high prevalence in the community-dwelling elderly population, hypertension may be an important factor influencing the development and progression of cognitive aging. Although hypertension is a major health problem that has been shown to affect cognition, very little is known about its effects on the molecular status, especially the epigenetic status, of brain regions critical to cognition. However, significant literature is accumulating describing effects of selective cognitive tasks on epigenetic mechanisms in rodents. The known effect of hypertension on cognition, and the accumulating literature on the epigenetic bases of selected cognitive capacities leads to the overarching hypothesis to be tested by this project: epigenetic changes induced in a rodent model of hypertension will mirror the known relationships between cognitive tasks and epigenetic mechanisms in rodents. We focus on epigenetic mechanisms since these are major factors in the regulation of gene expression. Specifically, this project is aimed at determining epigenetic changes induced by hypertension in subregions of the brain known to be important to cognition. We will study brains from 20 normotensive controls and 20 hypertensive behaviorally characterized rats, who have also received high resolution in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scans of brain structure and white matter integrity. Male Fischer 344 rats have the cytochrome P450 promoter (Cyp1a1) inserted to up-regulate the expression of the mouse renin (Ren2) gene, Administration of 0,15% indole-3-carbinol {I3C) to the diet of these transgenic rats activates the Cyplal promoter to induce a gradual onset of hypertension. Dependent variables will be gene expression and the major epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as measures of cognitive performance and patterns of MRl gray and white matter integrity. Defined sub-regions, of the hippocampus will be isolated by laser capture microdissection. In order to obtain sufficient starting material successive sections from the same brain will be pooled. We will assess DNA methylation on a genome wide basis by bisulfite conversion, amplification and NimbleGen arrays. PCR will be used to assess DNA methylation of specific genes based on previous findings of others and array data produced by this project. We will assess selected histone modifications by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by PCR of selected genes. The genes we select are those previously shown to be differentially expressed in brain regions, with an emphasis on hippocampus, in association with learning and memory. We will test our major hypothesis by statistical determination of hypertension-induced epigenetic changes in our model and then compare the resulting data with epigenetic changes associated with cognitive behaviors and MRl gray and white matter integrity. We will use multivariate analyses to estimate the extent to which epigenetic variables account for cognitive status in the experimental animals."
"9193418","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Individual institutions across the country have worked to support research in a wide variety of areas, including precision medicine research, by developing large biorepositories comprised of biospecimens and health data collected from local patients and controls. However, these local cohorts rarely provide the diversity and size needed to identify and study subsets of patients who share biological mechanisms for their disease, and are thus more likely to respond to the same targeted therapies. To address this need, researchers have begun to promote the networking of multiple repositories within or across multiple institutions. This networked biorepository approach makes it possible for researchers to access larger, more diverse sets of data and biospecimens in a way that leverages the research relationships that local institutions have built with their own communities of donors. In order for this approach to be successful, networked biorepositories need to address important ethical, legal, and social challenges. Networked biorepositories are comprised of diverse sets of specimens and data from different institutions, each with their own governance structures and donor needs. For these reasons, they encounter complex issues related to consent and donor permission, privacy and data security, and data access. These novel challenges have not previously been examined in detail, and best practices for addressing these issues through governance and oversight processes are lacking. This study will address these important needs through a rigorous, mixed-methods study of the perspectives and experiences of stakeholders currently engaged in designing, operating, and governing networked biorepositories. It will also aim to develop approaches to consent and donor permission, privacy and data security, data access, governance, and oversight that are most appropriate and effective for a variety of networked biorepository configurations."
"9063849","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a known risk factor for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Because the prevalence of depression in HIV seropositive individuals is double that of the general population, effectively targeting depression in people living with HIV is an important public health need. Moreover, because depression and HIV infection share certain alterations in immune system function, namely suppressed innate immunity and overactivated cellular immunity marked by systemic inflammation, it may be possible to improve immune function in patients with HIV/AIDS by treating their depression. Although many clinicians generally consider selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) safe and effective in treating depression in HIV/AIDS, there have been very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressant medications among depressed HIV seropositive individuals, and results have been mixed. Moreover, no previous trials examined biomarkers of immune dysregulation common to both depression and HIV/AIDS. Our prior work has established links between depression, immune dysregulation, and HIV disease progression on the one hand, and immune regulating and antiviral effects of SSRI treatment on the other. For example, we found depression was associated with decreased natural killer (NK) cytolytic activity in both medically healthy individuals and in HIV- infected patients, and we showed that depression was associated with accelerated HIV disease progression. We also observed that resolution of depression was associated with increased NK cytotoxicity and we demonstrated that ex vivo SSRI treatment of immune cells enhances NK cytolytic activity. Further, we discovered that an SSRI inhibited HIV infectivity of immune cells e vivo, and that SSRI treatment significantly down-regulated the expression of HIV receptors and co-receptors (CD4, CXCR4, CXCR5) on macrophages and T-cells. Our studies thus indicate that SSRIs may have a direct action on peripheral immune cells. Taken together, this work suggests that SSRI treatment could conceivably reduce psychiatric morbidity and help reverse immune dysregulation in depressed, People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). To pursue our long-term objective of successfully treating co-morbid mental and medical disorders in HIV/AIDS, this study aims to determine whether: 1) SSRI treatment significantly increases innate immunity and decreases chronic inflammation and immune activation, and 2) changes in depressive symptoms correlate with changes in immune regulation in HIV/AIDS. This study will be the first double-blind, placebo controlled trial of a SSRI for treating depression in HIV/AIDS with a focus on innate immunity and inflammation. If successful, this project will advance the field of HIV care  by demonstrating for the first time, immune benefits of drug therapy for clinical depression and resolution of depressive symptoms among people with well-controlled viral load: thus leading to a potential new use of SSRIs as adjuncts to cART, which could lead to a change in clinical care of depressed PLWH, and set the stage for SSRI immune studies in non-depressed PLWH."
"9235807","This is a K01 application by Dr. Adel Driss, a research instructor at MSM. Dr. Driss is establishing himself as a young investigator pursuing research in global health to understand the molecular mechanisms mediating interactions between hemoglobinopathies and Malaria. Although these two diseases overlap in sub-Saharan Africa, the biological interactions between malaria and hemoglobinopathies are poorly understood. Dr. Driss recently returned from Ghana after an eleven-month field study sponsored by a Fogarty Global Health Fellows award to screen microRNA polymorphisms associated with severity of anemia in sickle cell and malaria in Ghana. This collaborative research was conducted between MSM and the University of Ghana (UG). He successfully obtained blood samples and clinical data and conducted preliminary analysis during his fellowship. This K01 award will greatly enhance Dr. Driss' goals of: 1) developing a path to independence in biomedical research; 2) conducting investigations on the role of microRNA's in the pathogenesis of malaria and hemoglobinopathies; 3) applying advanced genomic and proteomic methods to identify and validate biomarkers of malaria severity; and 4) developing global health collaborations between MSM in the USA and UG in West Africa. To achieve these goals, Dr. Driss has assembled a mentoring team consisting of: Dr. Stiles, Professor of Microbiology at MSM, who will provide support through his expertise in immuno- pathogenesis of blood diseases and hemoglobinopathies; Dr. Wilson, Professor of Parasitology at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the UG. Dr. Wilson will provide the necessary onsite support and guidance in the Ghanaian host institution; Dr. Hibbert, Associate Professor and an expert in animal studies relating to the role of nutrition in modulation of various human diseases will provide support for the proposed animal studies; and Dr. Quarshie will provide statistical support. The rationale for the proposed study is that specific host-derived microRNAs (miR-451 and Let-7i) have been associated with protection against the Malaria parasite in individuals with sickle-cell trait. These findings have never been validated in a population- based study. The hypothesis is that malaria severity is associated with alterations in expression of microRNAs linked to the hemoglobinopathy status of the individuals affected. Thus, Dr. Driss proposes 3 aims to (i) correlate miR-451 and Let-7i expression profiles with clinical blood analytical values and heme metabolism in individuals with different sickle cell status; (ii) characterize the role of miR-451 and Let-7i regulation on P. falciparum development in human erythrocytes in vitro and (iii) determine the role of miR-451 and Let-7i in modulation of pathogenesis of malaria and hemoglobinopathies in a sickle cell mouse model. The overall goal is to increase understanding of malaria severity in individuals with hemoglobinopathies and to identify molecular biomarkers that may be used to predict severity risk which can be attractive targets to malaria protection therapies. The experience gained will allow Dr. Driss to successfully compete for an R01 funding."
"9173927","Project Summary / Abstract  The two most common types of chronic wounds are venous ulcers (VUs) and diabetic ulcers (DUs). We will conduct the first double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of low-frequency, low- intensity (LFLI) ultrasound (US) on chronic wound healing and health related quality of life (HRQOL) with high statistical confidence (? < 0.05, power > 0.90, n=60 VUs, n=60 DUs). Our approach combines this active therapy with non-invasive diagnostic monitoring of wound hemodynamics throughout the treatment cycle, and includes analysis of the impact of nutritional status and inflammation on wound closure. There are several innovative aspects of this work. Specifically, (1) Our lightweight, battery-powered applicator is the first potentially wearable ultrasound wound therapy device that is safe to apply for extended periods of time. (2) The applicator actively promotes healing, which is fundamentally different from commercial ultrasonic systems that remove necrotic tissue only. (3) Our approach will link LFLI US exposure to changes in wound hemodynamics and HRQOL, which has the potential to enable personalized medicine. (4) Our analysis of patient nutritional and systemic inflammatory status may enable further treatment customization by identifying those patients most likely to benefit from LFLI US therapy. (5) Our approach incorporates both disease-specific and generic measures of HRQOL, which is unique for a therapeutic ultrasound RCT.  Our low-frequency, low-intensity (20 kHz, <100 mW/cm2 spatial peak-temporal peak), portable ultrasound applicator is safe and clinically pragmatic wound treatment. The field lightweight (<25g) and permits parameters of our US device were previously optimized for venous ulcers, and our three recent pilot clinical human studies (VUs: n=20, n=25; DUs: n=10) demonstrated that our treatment improved healing by 15% per week compared to sham treatment. We therefore anticipate that our treatment will accelerate closure of chronic wounds, and we hypothesize that (1) LFLI US will improve generic and disease-specific HRQOL scores, (2) LFLI US will activate beneficial changes in the microvasculature of the wound and surrounding tissue, and (3) individuals with poor nutrition and high levels of inflammation will have delayed wound healing.  Our specific aims are to: (1) Assess the effect of LFLI US on VUs and DUs by measuring wound closure as a primary endpoint and generic and disease-specific HRQOL as secondary endpoints. (2) Monitor the effects of LFLI US on wound perfusion and oxygenation using non-invasive optical methods, and (3) Determine the impact of nutritional status and inflammation on closure of DUs and VUs. Overall, this work will validate LFLI US as a safe, portable, and cost-effective therapy for chronic wounds. This is important because new therapies and improved clinical paradigms for wound management are urgently needed. Over the long-term, our findings may enable the development of personalized wound treatment regimens across care settings."
"9140165","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover drugs that will make menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) safe for long-term treatment of chronic conditions associated with menopause. Due to the increasing longevity of women, menopause has become a critical issue in Women's Health. Life expectancy for women is now 81.2 years. Unlike just a century ago, most women will reach menopause and live approximately one-third of their life after menopause. There are currently 36 million menopausal women in the U.S. and the number is projected to soar to about 50 million in 25 years. Unfortunately, menopause is associated with an increase in the incidence of osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Long term exposure to MHT decreases the risk of these conditions. MHT is approved for short-term treatment of hot flashes and vaginal/vulvar symptoms, since long-term treatment with MHT is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular risks and Alzheimer's disease. A major breakthrough in primary prevention for Women's Health would occur if safer MHT regimens could be developed for long-term treatment. We discovered compounds termed ER? coligands that reprogram the effects of estradiol on gene expression and cell proliferation. Our data indicate that the ER? coligand binds to the surface of ER?, at a  separate binding site than estrogens, leading to an increase in binding of E2 to its binding site. The binding of both ligands simultaneously to ER? produces a change in conformation as demonstrated by an alteration in the melting temperature of ER?. These studies indicate that the conformation of the E2-ER?-ER coligand complex is distinct from the E2-ER? complex leading to the reprogramming of the E2 transcriptional and cellular effects. In fact, we found that  the E2/ER? coligand combination reprograms E2 to regulate over 800 unique genes in U2OS cells. These genes are not regulated by E2 or the ER? coligand alone. It is well established that E2 stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells by binding to ER? resulting in the activation of oncogenes, such as c-MYC. We found that the ER? coligand reprograms ER? so E2 no longer causes cell proliferation, nor does it stimulate c-MYC production. The ER? coligand also blocked E2 stimulation of uterine growth in mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that ER? coligands can be combined with existing estrogens, used in MHT, to block the adverse proliferative action of E2 to allow the ER? coligand/estrogen combination to be used safely for long-term MHT treatment. The aim of this phase I proposal is to select a lead ER? coligand/estrogen combination that has the best safety profile in cultured cells and animals prior to advancing it to Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic and other pre-clinical testing in a phase II proposal. These studies have the potential to facilitate the early development of a new type of MHT, that can be used for long-term administration, to prevent chronic diseases associated with menopause, such as osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome."
"9169922","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, have the shortest survival times and the highest rate of relapse. These patients have no currently available forms of targeted therapy and most (~77%) succumb to metastases within 5 years. However, the nature of how metastasis relies on signaling from the tumor microenvironment is not well understood.  Macrophages have also been linked to human breast cancer invasion and metastasis as well as drug resistance, and recently have been implicated in TNBC. M1-like pro-inflammatory macrophages are thought suppress tumor growth and metastasis, whereas the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are characterized as M2-like pro-metastatic macrophages. However, recent proteomic and RNA studies indicate that macrophage populations are composed of more phenotypic subtypes than previously recognized. Thus, the phenotype of TNBC TAMs and the mechanisms by which they interact with TNBCs are not well understood and require further characterization.  In recent studies I have been testing the hypothesis that TNBC recruits a unique subtype of TAMs via CCL5 that drives invasion and metastasis. Using genetically matched metastatic and non-metastatic TNBC tumors that differ only by expression of the metastasis suppressor Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP), I show that RKIP alters not only the number of recruited TAMs but also their phenotype. I further demonstrate that CCL5 expressed by metastatic tumors recruits TAMs that secrete pro-metastatic factors, promote invasion of TNBC cells, are highly expressed in human TNBC patients, and contribute to a prognostic signature for patient survival. Taken together, these findings suggest that TNBC recruited TAMs are both phenotypically and functionally distinct from other TAMs, and M1 or M2 macrophages.  I now propose to test the hypothesis that these TAMs can be distinguished by unique surface receptors that regulate expression and secretion of pro-metastatic factors. I further propose that TAMs recruited by CCL5 to metastatic TNBCs drive metastasis through expression of GRN along with other associated factors. Specifically, I will: 1) Characterize the phenotype of pro-metastatic TAMs in TNBC; and 2) Determine the functional role of TAMs & TAM secreted factors in TNBC metastasis. This study is innovative because it seeks to understand the phenotype of a novel TAM subtype identified in TNBC, as well as the in vivo mechanism of TAM driven invasion in TNBC. Together, these results could generate new diagnostic markers and prognostic signatures as well as identify potential therapeutic targets to deplete or reprogram pro-metastatic TAMs in TNBC patients. This work should also lead to a better understanding of the role of TAMs in the poor outcomes of TNBC patients."

This renewal resubmission application capitalizes on the discovery of two hit series ? the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides and the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamides ? and seeks to advance these to potential TB treatments. As the first to patent, prolifically publish, and propose the mechanism of action for the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IAPC) series, we are the most experienced group to continue development of this series through primate evaluation in preparation for clinical (human) studies. Recently, we had the PK of two lead compounds evaluated in primates with one ND-10885 showing great exposure (>20 hours of drug levels above the MIC). Additionally, we have disclosed the impressive in vitro properties of the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole 5-carboxamide (IT) series, a new promising, rationally designed, scaffold we will develop within this proposal. This new class has low nanomolar antiTB activity against H37Rv, multidrug resistant (MDR) and extreme drug resistant (XDR) Mtb as well as good in vitro metabolism and in vivo exposure with greater lung to plasma ratios. Furthermore, both these heterocyclic scaffolds (IAPC and IT) can be prepared in bulk (50 ? 100 g) inexpensively and, from these penultimate intermediates, lead compounds with animal efficacy can be prepared in just one synthetic step (amide bond formation) and in multi- gram quantities (>15 g). Through our extensive collaborations, we will evaluate all samples for antiTB activity [including MDR and XDR strains of Mtb]. We will also perform related studies, including microbe selectivity, gross toxicity particularly looking to avoid mitochondrial toxicity, metabolism, pharmacokinetics (PK), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), mice and/or monkey efficacy and mode of action studies of any new compounds with promising activity and physicochemical attributes including metabolite identification. Our criteria for a clinical candidate are: selective nanomolar potency against H37Rv and drug resistant Mtb, in vivo efficacy comparable to first line drugs isoniazid and rifampicin (at a dose <100 mg/kg), low toxicity (at least 10x over effective dose), minimal drug-drug interactions, good aqueous solubility (>100 µg/mL) and synthetic simplicity/cost effectiveness. A highly qualified team of coworkers and collaborators from experienced laboratories from academia, industry and the NIH has been assembled to accomplish the overarching goal of providing the TB- research and biomedical communities the second new drug treatment in 40 years as well as a validated new drug target (respiratory bc1 complex of Mtb)."
"9206968","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the United States, it is estimated that one-third of all new HIV diagnoses are among people less than 25 years of age. There is strong evidence that adherence to ART is a primary determinant of virological suppression, disease progression, and mortality. However, a recent review and meta- analysis of research on youth with HIV found an average ART adherence rate of 53% in North America, the lowest adherence rate globally. Intensive and/or in-person adherence intervention models have been problematic for youth with HIV. Interventions requiring multiple visits, even with brief, in-person sessions, have been difficult for youth to complete. These models have largely failed to promote long-term, sustained medication adherence (and sustained viral load below detection), and are commonly cost prohibitive for use in real world settings regardless of efficacy. Given these issues, one possibility for sustainable, yet individualized intervention delivery is through mobile health/technology-based approaches. This proposal directly addresses the urgent need for culturally acceptable, youth-friendly ART adherence interventions that can be rapidly implemented in clinical settings. We plan to conduct a clinical trial comparing two promising youth-friendly intervention strategies: weekday cell phone support (CPS) and daily text messaging (SMS). In pilot studies, both have demonstrated significant improvements in medication adherence. Participants who received CPS showed significant reductions in HIV viral load during the 24 week intervention; moreover, effects persisted for 24 weeks post intervention. The proposed research moves beyond a traditional clinical trial by utilizing a ?SMART? (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) design as a cost-effective and methodologically rigorous way to explore additional questions to optimize the interventions and maximize clinical utility and real-world implementation. This SMART design will allow us to identify the most effective and cost efficient sequence of SMS and/or CPS, utilizing incentives strategically, and tapering to sustain the impact of the intervention. We hypothesize that youth randomized to CPS will have significantly greater viral load suppression (primary outcome) and self-reported medication adherence (secondary outcome) than those in the SMS group. The proposed research brings together a team of skilled HIV clinical and behavioral researchers with decades of experience with clinical care and adherence research with youth, including numerous collaborations within the NIH-funded Adolescent Trials Network. This research will be conducted at five clinical sites with decades of experience conducting trials and that have a track record of excellence in recruiting, retaining, and collecting data from youth living with HIV."

"9145272","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment."

"9133337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half of pregnancies in women with lupus are complicated by miscarriage, preterm birth, or preeclampsia, most commonly in women with significant lupus activity. The guiding principle of lupus management is thus to use the safest available medications to prevent flares during pregnancy. Data supporting this principle are scarce, however, and based on small cohorts. Limitations in the data have also prevented identification of the best treatment strategies for women with varying risks. The goal of this proposal is to identify strategies that optimize pregnancy outcomes using comparative effectiveness approaches. The first method will be a patient- level meta-analysis based on datasets from published lupus pregnancy cohorts; 8 of the largest cohorts have already demonstrated interest. By stratifying pregnancies by lupus activity, prior renal disease, and maternal race, this analysis will yield new data about optimal medication therapies to control lupus and improve pregnancy outcomes. The second method, a decision analysis, will assess potential cost and pregnancy benefits of optimal lupus management. These two aims will offer new data to guide lupus management. Integrating this knowledge into daily practice, however, will be a challenge. For example, current best practices, like continuing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in lupus pregnancy, have not yet moved from expert clinics to daily practice. An exploratory aim will use mixed methods to ask community rheumatologists to identify strategies and tools that would enable them to integrate expert recommendations into daily practice. An essential goal is to develop an active Patient Advisory Council (PAC), comprising primarily mothers with lupus, to guide Dr. Clowse in these and future projects. This PAC will be integrated into many aspects of this proposal. Dr. Clowse, a national leader in clinical management of rheumatologic disease in pregnancy, seeks to build new methodology skills to move her research forward. To this end, this proposal outlines a program of research projects, apprenticeships, mentoring, and course work in statistics, comparative effectiveness, and patient-centered outcomes methods. With the primary mentorship of Gillian Sanders-Schmidler, PhD, Director of Duke University's AHRQ-funded Evidence-Based Practice Center, Dr. Clowse will build strong meta- analysis skills. She will practice decision analysis with co-mentor Evan Myers, MD, MPH, lead author for numerous women's health decision analyses and guidelines for AHRQ. At project completion, Dr. Clowse will have the skills, the data, and the stakeholder partnerships needed to drive innovation in the management of lupus in pregnancy."
"9350992","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to understand how thoracic multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) combined with innovative image analysis techniques can be used to identify COPD patients at greatest risk. The overall objective of this proposal is to focus on the pulmonary vasculature. We hypothesize that novel quantitative MDCT-based metrics that characterize heterogeneity of pulmonary parenchymal perfusion and pulmonary vascular anatomy in early stage COPD subjects will allow us to identify subjects at greater risk for rapid disease progression. Numerous observations from our own laboratories and others point to an abnormal pulmonary vascular response to smoking induced parenchymal inflammation that leads to the development of emphysema. We have established imaging methods for the quantitative assessment of the pulmonary vascular tree and regional pulmonary parenchymal perfusion status. The former measure takes advantage of volumetric MDCT and the later makes use of dual energy MDCT (DE-MDCT) to provide clinically implementable tools for the interrogation of lung structure and function. Our Specific Aims are as follows: (1) determine whether objective, quantitative measures of increased PBV heterogeneity derived from DE-MDCT, as an index of emphysema susceptibility, will serve as a very early indicator of rapid emphysema progression (assessed by MDCT) and lung function decline; (2) determine whether anatomic changes in pulmonary vascular geometry will identify subjects at risk for more rapid emphysema progression and lung function decline, possibly in more urgent need of intervention; and (3) determine whether early anatomic and functional markers of vascular disease will combine to identify subjects at increased risk for development of frequent exacerbations who require more intense therapy before significant lung function decline has occurred. In this time-sensitive proposal, we will leverage the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). SPIROMICS offers a unique opportunity to study at risk smokers and individuals with COPD in a longitudinal study that are well-characterized in terms of repeated clinical, physiological and biological evaluations. We propose to insert a baseline DE-MDCT scan to evaluate an index of pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity (Perfused Blood Volume: PBV) in 200 GOLD 0/I subjects at baseline and to insert a 3rd year MDCT exam into the SPIROMICS protocol for these same individuals. We also propose a year 3 MDCT exam in an additional 125 GOLD II-III SPIROMICS subjects. Our over-riding goal is to evaluate early functional and anatomic indices of vascular dysfunction to determine the association between these metrics and rate of emphysema progression, lung function decline and risk of AECOPD."
"9206289","Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells."
"9243880","Project Summary/Abstract This is a revised submission for an AHRQ Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) by Christine D. Jones, MD, MS. My overall career goal is to develop and implement interventions that improve patient outcomes through more effective care coordination between clinicians. Care transitions from hospital to home can be perilous for patients, and fragmented communication contributes to many preventable adverse events during this transition. Home health care (HHC) is increasingly employed with the intent to improve care transitions, but even with home support, older adults remain vulnerable to adverse events after discharge, including hospital readmissions, which contribute to progressive disability for these patients. With this career development award, I will develop an intervention that improves care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses that aims to reduce adverse patient outcomes, including medication errors and hospital readmissions. Candidate and Mentors: I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado where I practice as an adult medicine hospitalist. I completed a research fellowship and have conducted studies to describe barriers to care coordination, a systematic review of interventions to reduce readmissions, and analyses of HHC referrals at hospital discharge. I have built productive relationships with my mentors and have completed two manuscripts ? one published, one in press - with my primary mentor, Dr. Frederick Masoudi. Research and Training: I will build on my prior research through three complementary research and training aims that will inform an intervention to improve the quality of care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses caring for older adults after acute hospitalization. I will: (1) employ qualitative methods to understand HHC nurse, patient, and caregiver experiences of care coordination, (2) generate predictive models to identify modifiable risk factors for 30-day readmissions from HHC within national Medicare data, and (3) develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot intervention to connect hospitalists and HHC nurses to optimize post-discharge care coordination and reduce adverse patient outcomes. At award completion, I will have the training and skills to be a successful independent investigator and will pursue funding for a pragmatic clinical trial to test the effectiveness of an intervention to improve care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses. Summary: Effective care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses is critical to support high-quality care transitions for vulnerable patients after acute hospitalization. The proposed research will inform an intervention to improve care coordination between hospitalists and HHC nurses and enhance outcomes for patients receiving HHC services after hospitalization. This award will support my development into an independent investigator with expertise in enhancing care coordination between clinicians to improve outcomes for the growing number of patients discharged with HHC services."

"9169483","Abstract The purpose of this New Innovator research is to move beyond the limited notion of the placebo effect as some mysterious response to an inert substance toward the recognition that ultimately our mindsets (e.g., beliefs and expectations) are responsible for these responses. The idea of a ?placebo response? has been recognized for centuries yet has typically been marginalized from mainstream medicine as something to be ignored or controlled for. Yet the power of placebos?more usefully expressed as the power of conscious or subconscious mindsets?is becoming increasingly difficult to deny. Advances in research illuminate that mindsets influence health through precise neurobiological mechanisms without the aid of treatment (placebo treatments have proven to be effective in a number of conditions ranging from pain and depression to cardiovascular disease and Parkinson's disease) and they also moderate the effectiveness of active drugs and therapies (drugs and therapies given without the patient's awareness or expectation to heal can be up to 90% less effective than when the patient fully expects to experience the effect of the drug or therapy). Furthermore, our research has demonstrated that placebo-like mindset effects also play a role in determining the benefits of behavioral therapies such as exercise, diet and stress. As the major health threats of the 21st century move away from infectious disease towards non-communicable or chronic diseases (e.g. obesity, heart disease, mental illness, diabetes), understanding these effects becomes increasingly more important. This research focuses on the influence and effect of mindset in various stages related to chronic disease. First we will conduct innovative research aimed at better understanding of the role of mindset in the expression of chronic disease by a) discover the impact of mindsets about genetic predisposition for chronic disease on the ultimate expression of those genes, a topic that is increasingly relevant in this day of ?personalized medicine?; b) advancing our understanding of the impact of mindset in determining the effects of health behaviors such as exercise, diet and stress; and c) expand the meaning of health to include more compelling and enriching definitions. Second, we intend to empower and enable individuals and healthcare practitioners to harness mindsets in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease by a) developing and testing innovative methods to change mindsets in non-deceptive and ethically appropriate ways; and b) understanding and overcoming barriers for health practitioners to incorporate mindset change in 21st century healthcare.  "
"9201149","To more completely assess the fungal species to which people are exposed, a fungal ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing study was designed to test the hypothesis that fungal bioaerosols in the United States indoor built environments are much more diverse than previously estimated using traditional methods of analysis. In FY16 fungal rRNA sequencing data from samples collected from a variety of geographic regions within the United States including Atlanta (Georgia), Bennington (Vermont), and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) were analyzed using Illumina miSeq high throughput sequencing or Sanger sequencing to characterize fungal diversity in air and dust samples. In air and dust samples collected from the Atlanta and Bennington study sites the diversity of fungi is primarily composed of species placed in the phylum Ascomycota. Compared to viable culture datasets collected from the same location, species within the phylum Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Chytridiomycota were additionally resolved. The Basidiomycota species and causative agent of loose smut, Ustilago syntherismae, as well as Cryptococcus yeast species were the most abundant fungi identified in the Bennington analysis. The results of these ITS rRNA gene sequencing studies have provided new insights into the spectrum of fungi present in dust samples derived from occupational environments.  As part of a broader Philadelphia school study to evaluate dampness and mold contamination in approximately 50 Philadelphia district schools NIOSH extracted and prepared 310 dust samples for Illumina MiSeq sequencing. These samples have been sequenced and the fungal diversity datasets will be analyzed in FY17.  Additional studies are examining the molecular diversity of fungal contaminants as part of the NYC Neighborhood Asthma and Allergy Study. Preliminary analysis of analyzed dust samples indicates that Aureobasidium pullulans, Penicillium glabrum, Wallemia sebi and Alternaria alternata varied by housing type (single, multi-family or apartment) and neighborhood asthma prevalence. Preliminary results suggest that multiple environmental factors including anthropogenic behavior modification, housing type, and neighborhood are important variables that influence fungal diversity within middle-income homes in New York City. A. alternata measured in house dust was also associated with fractional exhaled nitric oxide, specifically among children with higher combustion byproduct exposure, suggesting a possible interaction between these two exposures on airway inflammation. Fungal diversity captured using Illumina miSeq was compared to results obtained using qPCR.  Work has continued in the development of antibodies to recombinant fungal biomarker antigens.  The utility of these antibodies is critical for the quantification of fungal biomarkers, particularly to those fungi that are being studied by the NTP. NIOSH has recently developed a recombinant Alt a 1 homologue from Ulocladium chartarum tentatively named Ulo c 1. Polyclonal antibodies (pAb) have been produced toward the recombinant Ulo c 1. In FY16, pAb reactivity with rUlo c 1 as well as cross-reactivity with other Alt a 1 homologs has been determined and sandwich and inhibition ELISAs developed. Epitope mapping experiments are planned in FY17 to identify pAb affinity and specific epitopes."
"9209495","Project Summary Patients and their families often have difficulty managing medications, especially across transitions of care. Two-thirds of all adverse events following hospital discharge are related to medications. The problem of medication management is magnified for older patients, who are often on multiple medications and for whom side effects and drug-drug interactions may lead to more harm. InfoSAGE (Information Sharing Across Generations) is an existing AHRQ-supported research project that seeks to understand and address information and care coordination needs of older adults, age 75 and above, and their families who are involved in their care. Research participants use an online private social network, built for the project (https://www.infosagehealth.org), to find resources and manage tasks and communications. Our approach uses health information technology in a new way, creating a community-based platform to improve care coordination, patient and family empowerment, and ultimately improve patient safety. In this project, we propose to expand the functionality of the InfoSAGE platform to include a mobile-first/point- of-care medication manager to help elderly people and their families keep an accurate medication list, coordinate the list with the prescribing clinicians, track the impact of medications on symptoms, view medication precautions and drug-drug interactions, and become more engaged as partners in their care. We will determine facilitators and barriers to the use of a shared online medication list, assess the usability and e-Health literacy needed for the tool, and measure its adoption and usage. We will then study the impact of the tool on medication safety and determine if increased engagement with the tool improves shared decision- making about medications and reduces the inappropriate use of medications and polypharmacy. Our long-term goal is to develop a set of best practices for the use of online and mobile tools for complex medication management."
"9202468","Project Description The proposed project seeks to identify and refine a suitable indoor positioning solution for use with the community-driven Hello Navi educational infrastructure accessibility initiative and improve the state of the art of indoor wayfinding options for the visually impaired. We outline a Phase 1 project to create a validation testbed in an environment with known sight-impaired mobility characteristics using a realistic multi-level educational setting. As the basis for our test- bed construction we will instrument two buildings at the Carroll Center for the Blind to support our experiment to achieve enhanced accuracy using a crowdsourced differential correction basis applied to two disparate positioning characteristics?location-services-supplied geo- location and user-supplied pedometer counts adjusted for anthropometric variance. These two positioning characteristics will be combined with a database schema indexed to provide for bulk location of the user within the building serviced and then establish the point of entry into our accuracy-enhanced relative reference frame. In Phase 1 we will conduct an aggressive indoor positioning solution overview with the intent of using the most promising elements and methods available in conjunction with our data-driven approach to produce enhanced accuracy and crowdsourced participation for indoor positioning solutions. By managing sparse collections of location reporting services data throughout the 2D indoor floorplan and supplementing this with pedometer calculated route lengths we envision a system benefitting from two alternative positioning characteristics one is based on sample average pedometer-derived route lengths between designated points of interest (POI) and the other is based on remote positioning provided by GPS and WiFi based location reporting services. We combine this positioning basis with an infrastructure based component consisting of affixed NFC tags located throughout the floorplan. Vertical displacement and floorplan indexing strategy for multi-level environments is addressed using a supplemental approach consisting of vertical access points being identified with the affixed NFC tags and a vertical accelerometer disturbance trigger to validate upward or downward motion, complemented by user-based confirmation of multi-level floorplan availability and selection. We also plan a multi-role commercial web portal as a basis for fostering activism and participation in facilities accessibility improvement within educational facilities nationwide. Our proposed Phase I test bed will provide a basis for quantifying the availability and accuracy of indoor location services and the error concerns related to lengthy pedometer displacement dependencies within or solution. Crowd-data collection methods will be employed to establish that commercial cell-phone location reporting combined with descriptive POI meta-data and normalize pedometer counts can be used to improve the scale and orientation modelling accuracy of a three-dimensional route plan for an indoor environment and that the data can be formatted sufficiently to support playback technology for delivering a usable electronic guide- rope service for those with vision impairment. The goal for Phase 1 is to isolate a most effective positioning solution for use with the Hello Navi initiative. We will employ adaptive design response during Phase 1 to produce a proposal for Phase 2 production engineering of the most promising indoor positioning solution. Note for this resubmission, material revisions have been introduced to our Project Description Specific Aims, Research Strategy, and References Cited along with the required Introduction detailing this re-submitted application."
"9352486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in five Americans over the age of 75 years (~4 million Americans) has type 2 diabetes and this population is expected to double over the next 25 years. These oldest patients have the highest rates of complications, geriatric conditions, adverse drug events and death, and yet evidence to guide their care is lacking. Despite the lack of evidence, over 50% of the oldest patients continue to receive intensive glucose- lowering treatment, irrespective of health status. Recent guidelines agree that care should be individualized, but lack specificity and are often conflicting. We lack an adequate understanding of how the oldest patients' barriers to self-management and treatment preferences align with medication use and impact safety-related outcomes. Current guidelines endorse the use of life expectancy for setting targets, but more readily identified characteristics, such as organ dysfunction, dementia or diabetes duration, may be just as useful for individualizing treatment. Additionally, it is unclear how changes in treatment intensity may impact safety- and diabetes-related outcomes and healthcare utilization.  Our objective is to evaluate diabetes management strategies that have clinical equipoise and controversy for our oldest patients with type 2 diabetes. We will conduct a survey among 3000 of the oldest patients with diabetes and their caregivers regarding barriers and preferences for care. We will link survey responses to robust clinical care data from a well-characterized, diverse population of 52,725 diabetes patients, ages ? 75 years: AIM 1: We will survey patients and caregivers regarding i) self-management barriers (e.g. financial barriers, poor functional status, inadequate health literacy) and ii) treatment preferences (e.g. for intensification, de-intensification) and evaluate to what extent barriers and preferences are associated with medication use (e.g., adherence, prescribing), and safety-related outcomes (e.g., hypoglycemia, falls). AIM 2: We will study variation in diabetes care, safety- and diabetes-related outcomes (hypoglycemia, complications, mortality) and healthcare utilization for specific risk groups (advanced kidney disease, heart failure, dementia, late onset diabetes). AIM 3: Among patients with A1C<7.5%, we will compare the impact of de-intensification vs. maintenance vs. intensification of therapy on safety- and diabetes-related outcomes and healthcare utilization. AIM 4: We will study the choice of medications used for intensifying treatment on safety- and diabetes-related outcomes and healthcare utilization after accounting for baseline glycemic control and treatments. Completion of these aims will elucidate the consequences of current medical decision-making and inform future guidelines for the oldest patients with diabetes."
"9146886","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The proposed CAHPS IV project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving health care by ongoing measurement and reporting of patients' experiences with care. We propose a 5-year effort to conduct quality improvement (QI) studies based on CAHPS data, enhance reporting guidelines and update existing reporting resources, extend the science of reporting, facilitate use of existing CAHPS survey, develop new surveys, evaluate new data collection methods, and promote the use of CAHPS products. Specifically, we will perform a systematic literature review and environmental scan focusing on how organizations learn to conduct effective QI using CAHPS surveys, an initial QI study of early, middle and late adopters of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model of care in a northern California preferred provider network, a final QI study of accountable care organizations, a pilot of a national learning network for organizations engaged in QI using CAHPS, cognitive interviews to evaluate composite labels for the CAHPS PCMH survey, an experiment evaluating innovative reporting techniques that involve combinations of standard CAHPS data with patient anecdotes about care, evaluation of the benefits and costs of including CAHPS roll- up scores in comparative quality reports, development of a Your CAHPS Survey tool to help users compile surveys tailored to their specific needs, and data collection (e.g., web versus interactive voice response) experiments. In addition, we will update the CAHPS Improvement Guide, TalkingQuality website and the Report Card Compendium, develop and evaluate a Spanish language report for the CAHPS PCMH survey, maintain existing survey tools and prepare OMB and NQF applications for CAHPS surveys, and advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative because it will yield important new information about how to improve health care using CAHPS data, improve reporting of quality information to consumers, facilitate use of existing CAHPS surveys by creating an interactive database and search engine, improve participation rates in CAHPS surveys by translating into the third most common language in the United States, and provide information about the comparability of data collected using existing and newer modes of data collection."
"9239923","Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ?Ciliary localization? model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ?discoverable? genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development."
"9142279","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective personal health information management (PHIM), including symptom monitoring, medication management and clinical care coordination, facilitates self-care, ensures appropriate use of health services, and improves health outcomes. Computer tools can assist with PHIM, but these solutions are often created with little attention to where they will be used. The visibility of a calendar for reminding one of a weekly blood test or the proximity of a Bluetooth-enabled glucometer to the computer that stores the readings can enable or interfere with PHIM. Designers must understand where PHIM occurs to make optimally effective solutions. Yet bringing designers and engineers into the private, personal spaces and allowing repeated, systematic study of home contexts is not only burdensome to the home dweller, but also infeasible due to the ever-changing nature of homes. The purpose of this project is to systematically determine how household context shapes personal health information management. Using Venkatesh's (1996) model of the five environments of health to explicate the environmental context in the SEIPS work system model, we will (1) undertake an extensive study of 20 households addressing the social, physical, psychological, technical and health services context of PHIM, including creating detailed photographic, video, and 3D reconstructions of these households in a virtual reality CAVE; (2) through recursive immersive exploration in the CAVE, enumerate the features of these households that shape PHIM; (3) enlist 20 people self-identified with diabetes in a requirements validation activity in the CAVE; (4) engage 60 people with diabetes in an experimental evaluation of these indicators and (5) use all of these results to develop and evaluate, in a field assessment of 200 households, an Assessment of the Context of Home Environments inventory. The reference set of 20 virtual homes will be distributed through Creative Commons for repeated studies by designers. We will also make available the Assessment of the Context of Home Environments (ACHE) protocol for rapid assessments of the home context. This interdisciplinary project brings together nurses, engineers, computer scientists, and health services researchers to explicate how the home context shapes health information needs and can be used to guide the design of consumer health information management solutions. As health care migrates from the institution to the home, and engagement of everyone in healthy practices is necessary to avoid disease or mitigate its consequences, systematic understanding of how homes will foster the integration of technologies into the every-day lives of people that ensure that homes not only become spaces for health but tools that draw people towards optimal well-being."
"8998778","We hypothesize that exploitation of NK cell function by immunogenetic influences, activation with IL-15/IL-  15R?-Fc complexes and targeting through CD16 can overcome inhibitory KIR interactions with HLA that  prevent target cell killing. NK cell activation in vivo can augment the successes of cancer suppression, and in a  series of clinical trials we will test the translational success of our findings. SA1 will include continuation of our  prospective multicenter KIR donor genotyping trial to identify the optimal KIR genotyped donor for unrelated  donor transplantation for AML. Having shown feasibility in enrolling the first ~400 recipients and their potential  donors, we will continue to prospectively identify donors with favorable KIR B haplotype that we demonstrated  can reduce risks of relapse and improve disease-free survival. The importance of CMV reactivation in  modifying this NK-mediated favorable outcome will be explored. SA2 will study how enhancing NK cell activity  using IL-15/IL-15R?-Fc complexes can enhance the success of NK cell adoptive transfer in the pre-transplant  preparative regimen followed by a novel TCR?/?-depleted graft to accelerate lymphoid reconstitution after  transplantation. Post-transplant IL-15/IL-15R?-Fc complexes infusions will augment NK cell proliferation  followed by a randomized trial testing adoptive NK cell transfer versus endogenous NK activation without donor  NK infusion; all to control high-risk leukemia after haploidentical transplantation. SA3 will target myeloid  hematologic malignancies with bispecific killer engagers (BiKEs), our newly developed myeloid-specific  CD16x33 single-chain Fv constructs. These direct activated NK cells to kill myeloid tumors and myeloid-  derived suppressor cells to control advanced myeloid malignancies. Overall, using discoveries derived from  Projects 1 and 2, we will translate knowledge about the immunogenetic regulation if NK cell function and  discoveries about CMV-induced adaptive NK cells with our novel pharmacologic agents to test these  approaches to treat cancer. We will monitor the immunologic and clinical consequences and translate our  findings into coordinated and complementary basic and clinical research to exploit NK cell control of advanced  cancer."
"9114108","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In patients with advanced degenerative diseases, both retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors are lost. If new cells can restore the function of the lost cells, a degenerating retina might be repaired and eyesight restored. Our team targets vision restoration by transplanting sheets of retinal progenitor and RPE cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to recipients that have lost photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Transplants of freshly harvested sheets of retinal progenitor cells (delivered by a unique procedure and instrument) have shown to develop photoreceptors with normal morphology, synaptic connections with the host and to restore lost visual responses in several retinal degeneration models and in human patients. This cannot be achieved by injecting dissociated cells into the retina. Although other approaches exist, the majority are restricted to rescue of endogenous retinal cells of the recipient by a 'nursing' role f the implanted cells, an approach which does not restore lost function. The supply of fresh fetal-derived neuroblastic tissue is limited. Differentiation of hESCs into sheets of photoreceptor progenitors and RPE cells would create an unlimited tissue supply for clinical and research use. Several laboratories have recently developed procedures to differentiate pluripotent stem cells into optic vesicles and optic cup-like structures that develop retinal cell types with some degree of lamination. We want to use this approach for producing laminated retinal progenitor sheets with RPE for transplantation. Our team has developed 1) a protocol to derive early retinal progenitor tissue from hESC and 2) a new immunodeficient rodent model of retinal degeneration. Additional pre-clinical animal research is required to develop a therapeutically viable and sustainable supply of stem cell derived material. A three-year project is proposed to test the hypothesis that (1) hESC-derived photoreceptor progenitors, transplanted together with a hESC-derived RPE sheet to a new immunodeficient rat model of RD, will develop mature photoreceptor markers and integrate with the degenerating host retina; (2) hESC-derived retinal progenitors can restore visual responses in this rodent model to the same extent as transplants of fetal retina with RPE, as shown by optokinetic testing and electrophysiology. Transplantation of intact ESC-derived retinal progenitor layers with RPE in rats with retinal degeneration provides an excellent model to answer an important question for developing retinal therapies. Proof of concept will provide a new tissue source to restore and improve vision in patients with retinal diseases."
"9013967","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Alberti is a new investigator seeking to establish herself as an independent researcher in vision rehabilitation. She has considerable experience in low vision clinical settings and in research methods and is a strong candidate to conduct the research described in the application. The project that is subject of the application will be critial for innovation and importance in the field of vision rehabilitation for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). AMD causes vision loss in the central retinal area used for high-resolution vision with relative sparing of peripheral vision. People with central field loss may develop the ability to compensate for the deficit by using a peripheral portion of their retina for vision: the  Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL). The selection of the PRL location depends on the size and location of the scotoma (blind spot caused by the disease), which is not the same size and shape in the right and left eyes. This project aims at evaluating visual function when patients use both eyes and investigating how the binocular PRL is derived from the locations of the monocular scotomas, and finally, measuring how the functionality of the chosen PRL changes with different tasks and conditions. The development of a functional PRL is the main objective of rehabilitation practices for AMD but the efficacy of rehabilitation training is not proven because of the lack of technologies and knowledge about how PRLs work. We propose to study binocular PRL selection by first simulating central field loss in normally sighted people (k99 phase). After underpinning the factors affecting PRL selection, we will recruit a clinical group with AMD to test our hypothesis from the simulation experiments. In addition, in this new phase (R00 phase) we will test binocular vision in everyday activities such as reaching for an object (reach and grasp). In order to measure binocular PRL location a new PRL mapping method will be developed and integrated in our testing protocol. The development of appropriate clinical and rehabilitation practices for elderly people with AMD is the main objective of this project in line with NIA mission. Thanks to this award, I will have the opportunity to study the PRL selection under the supervision of one outstanding mentor, Dr. Peter Bex who is currently leading the Translational Vision Group at the College of Science. My long-term goal is obtaining a research appointment and starting an independent lab with clear translational impact on important aging-related vision problems. An independent lab will require the acquisition of new technical skills and the instauration of clinical collaborations to recruit low vision subjects. The software development will be conducted with the help of Dr. Bex. The collaboration with Dr. Lashkari (eye doctor at a local retina clinic) will create a low vision subjects database for easy recruitment. I  will also benefit from my integration in the large community at Northeastern University for subjects recruitment and for the available learning resources."
"9115361","Program Abstract - Overall  The goal for this renewal application is to a) elucidate oncogenic Kras (Kras*)-regulated metabolic pathways  mediating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor maintenance, b) define collateral metabolic  dependencies, and c) establish how interventions targeting these processes influence tumor immunity, in order  to guide the design of clinical trials with existing drugs and to identify new therapeutic points of attack. Our P01  program comprises 3 highly interdependent and collaborative projects and 4 essential cores with the goals of  conquering PDAC through targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in conjunction with immunotherapy. Project 1  (DePinho with Draetta) has demonstrated that Kras* extinction in PDAC leads to pronounced tumor regression  that involves critical functions of Kras* in metabolic reprogramming. We have also identified Kras*-extinction  resistant cells (KRCs), which show dramatic adaptive metabolic changes (in OXPHOS and autophagy)  allowing survival upon Kras* inactivation. These studies thereby provide benchmarks for successfully targeting  Kras* in vivo and predicting resistance mechanisms that may be encountered in the clinic. Thus, the goal of  Project 1 is to kill the bulk Kras*-dependent tumor cells through identification of metabolic targets essential for  Kras*-mediated PDAC maintenance and to define methods to eliminate KRC through inhibiting autophagy and  OXPHOS survival mechanisms. Project 2 (Bardeesy with Kimmelman and Cantley) has discovered that PDAC  is dependent on lysosome-dependent nutrient scavenging pathways for metabolic homeostasis and tumor  growth, and has identified a transcriptional program that activates these processes. The goal of Project 2 is to  decipher how lysosomal scavenging supports PDAC growth and how cancer cells can escape their  dependence on these processes, thereby informing improved therapeutic approaches. Project 2 will identify  the metabolic outputs of lysosomal mediated recycling pathways, establish which of these outputs play roles in  PDAC growth, and explore metabolic escape pathways in order to identify novel therapeutic combinations  synergizing with lysosomal inhibition. Project 3 (Kalluri with Allison) has defined profound alterations in the  tumor microenvironment, including a prominent CD8 T cell infiltration following Kras* extinction in PDAC.  Project 3 will define the immune profiles throughout the genesis, regression and recurrence of PDAC and will  determine the causal role of CD8 and CD4 cells in PDAC regression, as well as explore new opportunities to  test the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy and assess the associated adaptive mechanisms underlying  immune suppression. Furthermore, Project 3 will determine the direct impact of metabolically targeted therapy  on tumor immunity and define effective methods to combine such therapies with immune checkpoint blockade  therapy. Highly innovative cores for Pathology (Maitra), Preclinical Therapeutics (Benes), Computation  (Futreal), and an Administrative Core will enable these Projects."
"9228108","  Identifying Modifiers of Anticipation in Myotonic Dystrophy Type-1 Abstract Many neurodegenerative conditions are caused by expansion of trinucleotide repeats (TNRs). Myotonic dystrophy type-1 is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'UTR of the DMPK gene. This progressive disorder affects nearly every system in the body, causing progressive weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, intellectual impairment, and respiratory failure. Myotonic dystrophy type-1 is a classic example of genetic anticipation whereby progressively more severe symptoms are seen in successive generations due to increasingly large CTG repeat expansions during germline transmission. In the most striking example of this, mothers with adult onset myotonic dystrophy may have a child with congenital onset myotonic dystrophy (CDM). The exact mechanism of repeat expansion in myotonic dystrophy is complex, with DNA repair, replication, recombination and even transcription implicated in the unstable nature of triplet repeats. This proposal aims to better understand the mechanism of anticipation through: 1) Identification of variants in DNA repair and replication genes in mothers who have a child with the most severe form of myotonic dystrophy, CDM, 2) Assessing the pathogenicity of these variants in a cell model system for precise measurement of difference in repeat expansion rates. Firstly, this proposal will perform whole exome sequencing using a cohort highly enriched for anticipation, those mothers who have had a child with congenital myotonic dystrophy. Currently, 45 families within this cohort have provided DNA. Whole exome sequencing will be performed to identify variants in DNA damage response genes. Secondly, variants will be assessed for pathogenicity in a cell model system. In this system, the CTG repeat length is correlated with the expression of a fluorescent reporter gene. The longer the CTG repeat, the lower the fluorescence. Variants identified in Aim 1 will be introduced into this system to assess for their effect on the CTG repeat length. Two variants in the DNA damage response pathway, CHEK1 and FANCM, which are suspected to have altered the mutation rate in a family with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy will also be assessed. At the completion of this proposal, we would hope to better understand the mechanism of anticipation, and repeat expansion in general. Such knowledge may provide therapeutic targets to modulate repeat expansion.  "

Research that is conducted to reduce the burdens caused by the racial disparities in cancer incidence is no exception. For this reason, a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BBSR) is an integral part of this Morehouse School of Medicine/Tuskegee University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership. For full/pilot projects, outreach, research education and planning and evaluation activities, the BBSR provides consultation and collaborative support regarding study design, data management, and statistical and bioinformatics analyses. The BBSR also assists in the development of grant proposals, abstracts, and manuscripts. In addition to its work supporting the research of Partnership investigators, the BBSR's support enhances the biostatistical and bioinformatics capabilities of the Partnership institutions. This is accomplished by providing guidance to junior investigators and scholars (underrepresented undergraduate/graduate and medical students, medical residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty) regarding sound applications of statistics and bioinformatics principles in cancer research.

"9167632","PROJECT SUMMARY Light is a profoundly important regulator of physiology and behavior across a wide range of organisms. Despite its importance for influencing physiology and behavior, the circuits by which light information is relayed from the eye to the brain to influence behavior are not well understood. The central goal of this proposal is to genetically map the circuits underlying vision by focusing on the connectivity and influence of the relay neurons of the retina, the retinal ganglion cells. We will use mouse genetics to identify the influence of specific retinal ganglion cell subtypes on behavior, investigate the influence of these retinal ganglion cells on signaling within visual nuclei, and map the connectivity of retinal ganglion cells in the brain at the cellular level. These studies will enhance our understanding of visual processing and have the potential to better inform our understanding and treatment of dysfunction and injury of the visual system to better improve human health."
"9173978","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT One of the current challenges in restoring vision through regeneration of the retina is the lack of means to activate endogenous progenitor cells for the production of a sufficient number of functional photoreceptors, as reflected in the NEI Audacious Goal Initiatives ( . To undertake this challenge, this project investigates a rather unconventional approach to photoreceptor regeneration ? tapping into the regenerative potential of a nearby tissue, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), for photoreceptor regeneration in the mouse eye using gene-directed reprogramming. Our long-term goal is to elicit photoreceptor regeneration in the mammalian eye for replacement without cell transplantation. NOT-EY-14-003) Recent studies using mammalian RPE cell cultures and transgenic mice have produced evidence for the feasibility of this unconventional approach to photoreceptor regeneration in the eye. Moving forward, this project tests the hypothesis that mammalian RPE's regenerative potential, when unlocked by proneural gene neurogenin3 (or neurogenin1), can produce functional photoreceptors and new RPE cells to sustain RPE structure and function. Experiments are designed to achieve two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 determines whether an RPE cell, when primed by neurogenin3, directly undergoes RPE-to-photoreceptor transformation (i.e., transdifferentiation), or if it first goes through a transformation into a progenitor-like stage generating cells with the potentials to differentiate into photoreceptor cells and RPE cells. This study promises to shed light on the cellular mechanisms of how the RPE gives rise to photoreceptor cells and replenishes itself. Specific Aim 2 determines whether functional photoreceptors can be generated in adult mouse using a gene delivery approach compatible with human application, and whether the RPE will be preserved structurally and functionally. This study is expected to produce compelling evidence supporting human feasibility of engaging the RPE as a convenient source of new photoreceptors for functional repair in situ without involving cell transplantation and the associated risks and potential complications."
"9228583","Project Summary  The new direct electron detectors (DED) now available for electron microscopes, together with improvements in the available software, has made it possible to determine the structures to about 2.5Å resolution of molecular assemblies, that have a molecular mass greater than about 200kDa, given reasonable homogeneity of the sample. We had a Gatan K2 Summit DED detector installed in July 2015 on our FEI Titan Krios electron microscope.  The DED has made it possible to re-examine many earlier results of viruses when complexed with cellular receptors or neutralizing antibodies to attain near atomic resolution. That means we will now be able to see the fundamental chemical bonds that determine the properties of viruses and their complexes with other molecules. It may also be possible to achieve near atomic resolution of large dsDNA viruses. We, therefore, plan to re-examine small icosahedral +RNA picornaviruses and icosahedral ssDNA parvoviruses when complexed with various ligands, as well as large dsDNA viruses. This is an enormous opportunity made possible by the convergence of gaining basic knowledge of virus structure and the vast improvements in electron microscope technology.  Our plans include the study of the rhino C and the EV-A71 and EV-D68 picornaviruses. The former viruses are responsible for about 50% of asthmatic attacks in children and the latter viruses have been responsible for recent outbreaks in Southeast Asia of hand, foot and mouth disease in children and for the childhood respiratory difficulties in the US in 2014, respectively. In particular we plan to study recent isolates of these viruses complexed with potential cellular receptors and with neutralizing antibodies. We are also planning to study virus-like particles of human B19 parvoviruses when complexed with potential cellular receptor molecules.  Many very large icosahedral dsDNA viruses have been isolated in the last decade. Previously these viruses had remained undetected and unknown because they were unable to pass through the filters used to differentiate viruses from bacteria. Although usually cultured on amoeba in the laboratory, their natural hosts include humans. They are able to perform most of the functions of a living cell and challenge the definition of a virus. Infection by Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus type 1 (PBCV-1) has been associated with schizophrenia. However, the full impact on human health of these numerous large viruses has yet to be fully established. Imposing the resolution should allow recognition of the minor capsid proteins and, therefore, insight into the assembly and infection processes of these large viruses."
"9198710","Few medical countermeasures are currently available to treat chronic multi-organ failures following exposure to life-threatening radiation during radiation emergencies and nuclear disasters, especially for aged victims. Endogenous adult stem cells (ASCs), also called tissue-specific stem cells, exist, often in a scarce quantity, in almost every adult tissues and organs. However, how to robustly induce ASCs by administering soluble molecules to repair the injured organs, which could be more clinically applicable and cost-effective, remains largely unknown. We found that systemic administration of recombinant Fc chimeras of human R-spondin 1 and Slit2 (rRspo1-Fc/rSlit2-Fc) protected young mice from death, even when given 24 hours after lethal doses of whole body irradiation (WBI). Mechanistically, WBI induced the expression of Robo1 in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Rspo1 acted synergistically with Slit2 to enhance the survival of irradiated ISCs and HSCs and to accelerate the repair of radiation-induced acute gut and bone marrow injuries. In this proposal, we will test (1) the efficacy of rRspo1-Fc/rSlit2-Fc in mitigation of chronic radiation syndrome in young and older male and female mice, and (2) the long-term effects of rRspo1-Fc/rSlit2-Fc in irradiated young and older male and female mice. We believe that the regimen of rRspo1-Fc/rSlit2-Fc may provide a safe and effective pharmacological method to stimulate the repair of radiation-mediated chronic damage of essential tissues in aged victims."

Building from both the success and lessons learned from the currently funded Center, the focus of the approach proposed in this application is to move from the study of the individual and collective impact of a set of preventive interventions delivered within a single community to the implementation and evaluation of a community-level prevention system. In addition, building from previous work of this group of investigators, data from the Illinois Violent Death Reporting System and administrative data gathered from city data archives will be used to evaluate policy-level prevention strategies that are currently being implemented in the target and other high burden communities in Chicago. These data will also be used to conduct a series of studies to inform policies to reduce and prevent youth and other forms of violence. This combination of activities is designed to address critical gaps in the field and buil the evidence-base regarding effective community and policy-level prevention strategies to achieve community-level impact on youth and other forms of violence. The Center's primary aims are: 1) to build a coalition of community, policy and academic partners to address the issues of youth and other forms of violence within Chicago neighborhoods; 2) to evaluate the process and impact of implementing a community-level prevention system (Communities that Care) in a high-risk urban community and to identify unique challenges and adaptations necessary for implementation in urban neighborhoods; 3) to evaluate the diffusion and impact of CTC on neighborhood social organization and processes (i.e., collective efficacy, social organization, connection and support, norms and attitudes toward violence), processes that have been empirically linked with youth and other forms of violence; 4) to evaluate and inform current policy strategies aimed at reducing youth and other forms of violence; 5) to provide training and technical assistance to build capacity for schools and community agencies to select and implement evidence-based interventions and to evaluate existing interventions within the community; and 6) to disseminate empirical findings regionally and nationally to scientific, practice and policy communities."

"9255726","Abstract ? Project Summary Cognition Therapeutics Inc. (CogRx) has discovered CT1812, a novel oligomer receptor antagonist that is the only drug candidate demonstrated to prevent and displace binding of Abeta oligomers to receptors on brain cells. By stopping the initiating event in the Abeta oligomer cascade, this first-in?class drug candidate completely blocks downstream synaptotoxicity and restores memory to normal in aged transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. CT1812 displaces receptor-bound Abeta oligomers by allosterically antagonizing the sigma-2/PGRMC1 receptor (Izzo et al., 2014a, b). CT1812 thus represents the first disease- modifying therapeutic that will test the oligomer hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease. Such a drug candidate would significantly impact the lives of the 35 million patients worldwide suffering from AD and MCI, for whom no disease-modifying treatment exists. This proposal seeks to identify biomarkers of CT1812 functional target engagement. The project proposes 1) measuring changes in expression levels of proteins regulated by sigma- 2/PGRMC1 in the presence of Abeta oligomers that are blocked by CogRx's sigma-2/PGRMC1 antagonists in neurons and 2) determining if such changes are observed in the brains, CSF or serum of transgenic mice treated with CT1812. The proposed studies will also conduct unbiased proteomic investigations on biofluids from wild type and transgenic AD mice treated with CT1812 or vehicle to identify patterns of altered protein expression associated with drug engagement with target in settings of disease. With this data, we propose to construct a pathway from CT1812 target engagement to peripherally available biomarker using targeted reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics data. The successful outcome of this project is the development of an assay to measure candidate biomarkers in humans for exploratory investigation in the clinic."
"9250360","Abstract  Bone conduction (BC) is the transmission of sound to the inner ear by way of skull vibration. Both bone conduction and air conduction (AC), the usual pathway by which sound reaches the inner ear, stimulate the organ of hearing within the cochlea in the same manner. Bone conduction is important clinically, as it is used to diagnose and treat chronic and congenital middle-ear disease. BC hearing aids overcome conductive hearing loss by bypassing the middle ear, allowing the inner-ear mechanisms of BC to stimulate the sensory hair cells of the cochlea. Bone-conduction headphones are being used in noisy environments to aid in communication while simultaneously allowing for the use of hearing protection to AC stimulus. Additionally, BC headphones may be used when it is necessary to maintain an open external ear, so as to not compromise AC hearing. In order improve such devices and to develop more-controlled tests for hearing loss, we need a complete model of BC stimulation of the normal and pathological ear.  BC hearing comprises three major components that act primarily on the 1) external, 2) middle, and 3) inner ear. Their relative contributions to hearing are not fully understood. We aim to quantify the contributions of the external- and inner-ear components in chinchilla, as they are comprised of several mechanisms, and to develop and test a network model for BC hearing in chinchilla and human. The contribution of the inner-ear mechanisms (fluid inertia, compression by bone, and transmission of sound pressure via cerebrospinal fluid) will be determined from measurements of intracochlear pressures (stapes velocity and cochlear sound pressure) during BC stimulation. Contribution of the external-ear mechanisms (ear canal compression, motion of the tympanic membrane with respect to the skull bone, and vibration of the jaw bone) will be determined from measurements of ear canal sound pressure and tympanic membrane velocity during AC and BC stimulation.  For further understanding of BC mechanisms, we optimize a simple model of the middle ear to fit modern AC sound data from chinchilla, an animal with human-like middle-ear structures and frequency range of hearing that has been used to study noise-related hearing loss. We add suitable BC sources to our model, with their frequency dependence defined by our measurements. We will optimize our model parameters using novel techniques we have developed. The model will be generalized to a human BC model, and tested and optimized using existing human BC data. Our model will allow us to investigate the effects of ear disease on hearing and to develop better BC-based devices for both treatment of ear disease and alternative modes of communication."
"9136669","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sense of touch is vital for interacting with the world around us. Increases in sensitivity to touch, as in hyperalgesia or allodynia, and loss of sensation, as in diabetic or chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, can both diminish quality of life. Some of these changes in somatosensation may occur at the molecular level in the primary sensory neurons, yet how the first responders in touch detect a mechanical stimulus is still a mystery. We know neither how the initial ion channel opening occurs in mechanotransduction, nor how differences in the transfer of mechanical energy to and through the channel can affect the sensitivity of the neuron to touch. The overall goal of this proposal is  to investigate how sensitivity to mechanical stimuli is affected by the structure of mechanotransduction channels and by the environment that surrounds them. Genetic and morphological variation among somatosensory neurons allows us to sense inputs ranging from a puff of air to a painful scrape. In C. elegans, different classes of mechanoreceptor neurons transduce mechanical stimuli with differing levels of sensitivity, making it a useful model system for studying mechanosensitivity. Working with this genetically tractable model allows us to investigate the properties of these channels within their natural environment. Previous work in our lab provides evidence that different channels expressed in distinct neurons exhibit different sensitivity to force. In preliminary studies, I found differences in constitutive currents between heterologously expressed wild-type MEC-4 channels and chimeric channels containing segments of the homologous DEG-1 channel. In the proposed research, I will use these chimeric channels to explore the role of various channel domains in determining the sensitivity of a given neuron within a specific environment. Other work from our lab has shown that the composition of the plasma membrane affects the ability of worms to sense touch. I will investigate the specific effects of these membrane manipulations on mechanotransduction. By increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie differences in mechanosensitivity, we may be better able to predict the molecular and cellular changes occurring in sensitization disorders and peripheral neuropathy."
"8998411","Project Summary  The Immunobiology Program aims to: 1) Understand the fundamental aspects of immune biology, including  activation, differentiation, inactivation, and transformation as these relate to cancer; 2) Forge a comprehensive  understanding of tumor immune surveillance using state-of-the art in vitro, animal model, and human  experimental systems; and 3) Translate novel clinical strategies for immunotherapy of cancer by the design,  implementation, and analysis of proof-of-concept human clinical trials. Established in 1974, this Research  Program received ?Outstanding? merit at the time of the last CCSG renewal application. The Program is Co-  Led by Robert Vonderheide, MD, DPhil, an expert in tumor immunology and immunotherapy, and Warren  Pear, MD, PhD, an expert in the molecular biology of leukocyte development and malignant transformation.  Drs. Vonderheide and Pear are experienced, NCI-funded investigators who are highly collaborative and whose  research interests span the realm of basic and translational science. There are 34 Program members from 10  departments and four schools with long-standing intra- and inter-Programmatic collaborations spanning the  Basic as well as Clinical Programs. Through these interactions, the members' collective expertise serves as a  rich resource for the pursuit of interdisciplinary approaches to fundamental questions about the immunobiology  and immunotherapy of cancer. Members include national leaders in basic immunology, tumor immunobiology  and translational immunotherapy. The Program Co-Leaders facilitate interactions through multiple weekly  seminars and meetings, promotion of collaborative grants and projects, an annual research retreat, Pilot  Project grants, and training programs. During the current project period, Program Leaders recruited new  members, expanded important forums, facilitated new collaborative grants, initiated new ACC-wide initiatives,  and were actively involved in decisions regarding new and existing Shared Resources. Currently, Program  members have $20.6M in research grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $11.3M is peer-reviewed and  $2.2M is NCI-funded. During the current project period, Program members published 421 cancer-related  publications, many of which are in top journals in the field. Of these, 17% are intra-Programmatic, 24% are  inter-Programmatic, and 29% are multi-institutional."
"9145812","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nerve agents are potent, organophosphorus toxins that act primarily by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase. The resulting accumulation o acetylcholine at synaptic junctions produces peripheral cholinergic crisis, and, in the brain, induces seizures and status epilepticus (SE). Without timely pharmacological intervention, death will ensue, or if death is prevented but the SE is not controlled, brain damage will result, with long-term neurological and behavioral consequences. The devastating effects of the sarin attack in Syria, in August of 2013, where 1,400 civilians were killed, 426 of which were children, brought again to the forefront the question of readiness and whether the existing medical countermeasures can save lives and protect against the long-term health consequences of exposure. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics have pointed out the reasons that children are more vulnerable to nerve agent toxicity, there is very little information on the appropriate countermeasures to protect the pediatric population, as data in immature animals are lacking. Here, we propose to test the combination of LY293558, an AMPA/GluR5(GluK1) receptor antagonist, with caramiphen (CRM), an antimuscarinic with NMDA receptor antagonistic properties, against soman-induced seizures, brain damage, behavioral deficits, and pathophysiological alterations in brain regions that underlie these deficits, in 12-day-old and 21-day-old rats. We have previously found that LY293558 and CRM are efficacious anticonvulsant treatments in adult rats, with the LY293558 having a faster seizure- suppressing action and greater neuroprotective effects. Recently, we discovered that when LY293558 and CRM are administered in combination, the results are far superior to those obtained when each drug is given alone; seizures are terminated in less than 10 min, neuronal degeneration is completely prevented, and the rats appear absolutely healthy the next day and have no weight loss. Targeting the glutamatergic system in immature rats to prevent nerve agent toxicity, with the use of a combination therapy that adds an NMDA antagonist to LY293558, is likely to be a most efficacious treatment, considering the high NMDA receptor activity in the developing brain, and its role in excitotoxicity."
"8999884","Project 003 - Project Summary/Abstract - Systems, Pathways & Targets (SPT)  The Systems, Pathways & Targets (SPT) Program is a newly formed program (created in 2011) that integrates  cancer-focused members from two prior programs with new members who have expertise in the systems  biology of cancer. SPT members focus on cellular signaling, tissue morphogenesis and computational  modeling/bioinformatics. The overarching goal of this program is to identify key proteins or points of crosstalk  for therapeutic intervention. To achieve this goal, three aims are proposed: 1) Identify key targets in signaling  pathways, developmental pathways, and metabolic programs that are relevant to cancer initiation, progression,  and therapeutic resistance, 2) Develop multi-disciplinary teams to study tumor heterogeneity and  microenvironment/cellular interactions, 3) Diversify multi-disciplinary approaches to develop new therapeutic  strategies. SPT members include cell biologists, immunologists, geneticists, developmental biologists,  computational scientists, and clinicians. Dr. David Fruman and Dr. John Lowengrub direct the program as co-  leaders. Their expertise in cellular signaling and drug development (Fruman) and systems biology of the tumor  microenvironment (Lowengrub) embody the scientific breadth of basic research in the program, their partnering  with basic and physician scientist members demonstrates the collaborative nature of SPT. Since the last  renewal, exciting progress has been made in the identification of new targets in cancer cells and the  development of small lead compounds against those targets. The first subset of these molecules are making  their way to the bedside in the form of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. Strategic partnering with members of  the Chemical and Structural Biology (CSB) program has led to the synthesis of a second subset of molecules  for evaluation in pre-clinical assays. In addition, SPT members have collaborated with bioengineers in the  Onco-Imaging and Biotechnology (OIB) program for the development of new tools for cancer research. New  collaborations with members of the Cancer Prevention, Outcomes and Survivorship (CPOS) program show  promise in identifying and addressing issues in the catchment area of the cancer center. In the future, the SPT  program leadership will continue to leverage the unique breadth and synergy among its members to build  collaborative teams that tackle long-standing problems using bold and innovative approaches.

"9185530","Project Summary The long-range goal of this research is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the normal performance and adaptive plasticity of smooth eye movements. The optokinetic reflex (OKR) prevents blurred vision during self-motion by producing smooth eye movements that compensate for full field image motion. Neuronal mechanisms of plasticity enable the OKR to adapt in the face of development, trauma, and disease. Although the roles of particular classes of neurons to signal transformations and plasticity have been identified, little is understood about how cellular mechanisms contribute to the day-to-day performance and adaptive capabilities of the OKR and other smooth eye movements. The objective of the proposed research is to elucidate how cerebellar activity influences signaling and plasticity in distinct classes of brainstem neurons responsible for smooth eye movements. The central hypothesis is that cerebellar and visual pathway synapses onto vestibular nucleus and nucleus prepositus hypoglossi neurons are differentially responsible for rapid initiation vs maintained components of smooth eye movements. The proposed research will examine the influence of cerebellar activity on eye movements evoked by moving visual stimuli. Cellular and synaptic physiological experiments in brainstem slice preparations will examine the short and long term dynamics of cerebellar and visual synapses onto cerebellar recipient neurons, which mediate cerebellar influences on signaling and plasticity on smooth eye movements. Distinct classes of cerebellar target neurons will be identified by their axonal projections and patterns of cerebellar synaptic cell terminals. The influence of visual pathway and cerebellar synaptic activity will be examined in cerebellar target neurons in the vestibular and prepositus nuclei. These studies will provide foundations for targeted investigations of the molecular mechanisms that mediate smooth eye movements as well as for pharmacological treatments of cerebellar disorders and of oculomotor disorders that cause nystagmus."
"9131711","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone metastases are a frequent complication of certain malignancies, including advanced stage prostate cancer. The current body of literature suggests that metastatic prostate cancers progress in regions of the bone marrow that normally support hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), termed 'niches.' Though the signaling mechanisms involved in metastatic prostate cancer cell (MPCC) engraftment have been elucidated, no study to date has defined the molecular mechanisms underlying MPCC progression in the bone marrow. We propose here a study that will identify and functionally validate the cell-surface and diffusible molecules produced by the bone marrow that are involved in MPCC progression in bones.  For our proposed study, we will use our lab's previously described ectopic bone marrow niche assay in which we can: (a) establish an HSC- and MPCC-supportive ectopic bone marrow niche upon transplantation of highly purified 'parental' osteoblastic murine cells under the renal capsule of a recipient mouse and (b) further fractionate the 'parental' population using a variety of surface markers into distinct osteoblastic subsets that differentially support HSC self-renewal and MPCC proliferation.  We first propose an in situ histological study to observe the locations of MPCCs in relation to our distinct osteoblastic cellular populations. From these observational studies, we will gain insight into which osteoblastic cellular subsets may engage in direct cell-cell interactions with MPCCs (i.e. cells in close proximity) and which distinct osteoblastic populations may engage in diffusible interactions with MPCCs (i.e. cells not in close proximity). We will next identify cell surface and secreted molecules expressed by our distinct osteoblastic subsets that are involved in MPCC proliferation dynamics using microarray gene expression analyses and multiplexed immunoassays, respectively. To validate candidate factors in the context of our ectopic bone marrow niche, we will employ both in vitro and in vivo assays to confirm the role that a specific molecule(s) plays in MPCC proliferation dynamics in bones.  Presently, bone metastases represent an incurable and often deadly stage of cancer progression, with current therapies often only offering palliative treatments. We propose here a highly translational study that will identify novel molecular interactions required for metastatic progression in bones that could potentially be exploited by future therapies."
"9156547","Project Summary Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating type of stroke with high mortality and morbidity. Preclinical models have identified key roles for immune responses in both acute brain injury and in functional recovery. However, studies in human patients have been more challenging. Linking the pathophysiology seen in rodent models to that seen in patients is critical to the successful development of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of ICH. MISTIE III is a NINDS-funded, phase-3 randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of minimally invasive hematoma evacuation on functional outcomes at 6 and 12 months after ICH. The trial design provides ICH drainage samples over days 2-5 after ICH onset, precisely the time points that local inflammatory responses contribute to injury and modulate responses that aid in repair in rodent models. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to answer fundamental biological questions about the pathophysiology of ICH in living patients over time. The overall hypothesis is that blood-derived macrophages transition to alternative activation over time and this transition is critical to resolution of inflammation via reduced cytokine signaling, enhanced phagocytosis, and inhibition of T effector responses. Ultimately, we predict that the timing of this transition directly impacts patient outcome. Aim 1 will determine the cellular immune responses in the brain and peripheral blood of patients over time. CD16+ monocytes, CD4+CD127+CD25- effector T cells, CD4+CD127-CD25+ regulatory T cells, and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells will be sorted for in depth transcriptional profiling using RNA-seq. Complementary studies will utilize mass cytometry to comprehensively define and phenotype the leukocyte populations and track cell populations over time. Changes in the immune responses will be integrated using systems biology approaches and associations with patient outcome will be identified. Aim 2 will determine how changing leukocyte phenotypes determine the effector functions of macrophages and T cells. Using ex vivo assays using macrophages and T cells harvested from patients blood and brain at various time points, the molecular mechanisms of phagocytosis and inhibition of effector T cell responses will be identified."
"9353943","We shall initially use in vitro slice preparations from the mouse brain to study thalamocortical interactions in both directions in the visual system, concentrating on cortical areas V1 and V2 and thalamic nuclei LGN and LP. We then propose to develop in vivo preparations to test hypotheses from the in vitro work. We make heavy use of optogenetics in combination with other stimulation paradigms to activate specific pathways and use both single cell recording and current source density analysis to measure responses. We are particularly interested in the role of the two distinct corticothalamic projections. One emanates from layer 6 and feeds back to the thalamic nucleus innervating that area; we hypothesize that its main function is to depress thalamocortical transmission by multiple complementary mechanisms. The other emanates from layer 5 and is organized in a feed forward fashion, innervating thalamic regions that do not innervate its cortical area; we hypothesize that this represents the initiation of a transthalamic, cortico-thalamo-cortical pathway organized in parallel with direct corticocortical projections. Finally, we shall also test the hypothesis that these dual pathways operate in a coincidence detection manner to control information flow. This could provide more general insights regarding cortical functioning, particularly with respect to new evidence that different cortical areas can dynamically cooperate depending on behavioral needs."
"9130026","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Thus, compelling questions remain regarding long term trends in incidence and prevalence for both T1 and T2 in youth, particularly among various racial and ethnic population subgroups. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and its highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component A, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to ascertain newly diagnosed incident diabetes cases throughout the study period and one additional prevalent cohort (index year 2017) for youth age < 20 years across our five well-established geographically dispersed Study Centers. Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to conduct surveillance work in a highly efficient manner. We frame our surveillance as an innovative three-tiered approach, starting with the most broad based and cost efficient approach at the highest tier (tier 1) and becoming the most focused in tier 3, with each tier optimizing use of electronic health records (EHRs). Specific Aims are: Aim 1: TIER 1 SURVEILLANCE (Prevalence)- To ascertain cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017 among youth age < 20 years at diagnosis; Aim 2: TIER 2 SURVEILLANCE (Incidence)- To continue to ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases in youth age < 20 years; Aim 3: TIER 3 SURVEILLANCE (Clinical Characteristics) - To confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers, to describe selected clinical characteristics at diagnosis, and to maintain an infrastructure that facilitates the development of more detailed ancillary studies by storing biological samples and preserving contact with potential study participants; Aim 4: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: To optimize efficiency of the SEARCH Surveillance activities through targeted development and validation projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data to operationalize each of the three tiers of surveillance. Thus, the well-established and highly productive SEARCH team is uniquely positioned to provide critical information on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9074438","Abstract - Core C (Computational Core)  The DNA and RNA next generation sequencing and experimental data generated by Projects 1 ? 3 require  trained bioinformaticians to process the data and conduct the downstream analysis to help the project  investigators interpret the results and identify target genes for validation. Over the past years, the  Computational Core has developed an infrastructure with powerful computing clusters, storage space, and  well-established software to conduct the computations required. We have also been working closely with  Project 1 and Core B (Preclinical Therapeutics Core) investigators to develop and improve the algorithms  for tracking molecular barcodes in vivo in order to to accurately evaluate genes for their tumor initiating  potentials and to identify targets for clinical treatments of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The following  three specific aims are proposed:  1. One significant contribution the Computational Core can make is to conduct integrative analysis  leveraging readily available MDACC internal patients and external public data sources to seek for answers,  formulate hypothesis, and validate the experimental results with dedicated computational biologists. We will  mine the private and public databases to provide information needed to guide the experiments and the  validation of the experimental results. Databases or archives containing data collected from TCGA, CCLE,  COSMIC, and MD Anderson Cancer Center's patient data repositories have been built with interfaces and  applications to facilitate exploration, and visualization have been developed. Data mining results will be  communicated with project investigators.  2. We will provide P01 investigators with statistical analysis of RNASeq gene expression data to identify  differentially expressed genes between genomic groups, disease subtypes, or treatment conditions to  identify biomarkers. A collection of publically available and internally developed tools have been configured  to run on the computing cluster that can be selected based on the nature of the experiment and data  structure. We will also further improve the algorithm we have developed for in vivo screening projects to  identify genes as potential targets of treatments.  3. We will process the next generation sequencing data following established standards and implement  quality control measures at each step to produce high quality data that can be used for downstream  analysis to identify target genes with clinical implications. A production level infrastructure has been  established to ensure the achievement of this goal."
"9000521","PROJECT-003: MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND CANCER GENETICS PROGRAM (MBCG)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Molecular Biology & Cancer Genetics (MBCG) Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive  Cancer Center (OSUCCC), led by Michael Ostrowski, PhD and Matthew Ringel, MD, unites a highly  productive, collaborative and cancer focused team of 44 basic and translational scientists representing 7  colleges and 18 academic departments at The Ohio State University. Program science is centered in four  major cancer-focused scientific themes: small non-coding RNAs and cancer, human cancer  genetics/genomics, signal transduction and therapeutic resistance, and tumor microenvironment. Program  members utilize state-of-the-art approaches to 1) identify genes and pathways that fuel tumor cell initiation and  growth, and 2) provide mechanistic details of how these genes and pathways contribute to tumor progression  and therapeutic resistance. Our overall goal is to define the mechanisms that account for the association  between genes and cancer and to exploit this knowledge in order to reduce the incidence of death from  cancer.  The Specific Aims of the MBCG Program are: 1) to identify human genes, including non-coding genes such as  those encoding microRNAs, that either through direct mutations or epigenetic mechanisms, result in an  increased predisposition to cancer; 2) to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression and  function of the genes contributing to normal development, cancer progression, and therapeutic resistance; 3) to  utilize the knowledge gained from gene identification and gene functions in tumorigenesis in order to reduce  the incidence of death from cancer.  During the prior funding period of the OSUCCC P30 CCSG, MBCG Program members published 810 research  papers, including 104 high impact (> 10) manuscripts in journals such as Cell, Cancer Cell, Science, Nature  Medicine, Nature Cell Biology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, and Journal of Clinical Investigation.  There is extensive collaboration, with 21% intra-programmatic, 31% inter-programmatic, and 66% multi-  institutional publications. Overall, 81% of MBCG publications are collaborative. MBCG Program members are  principal investigators (PIs) on seven NCI programmatic grants, including a P01 and U01 in breast cancer (P01  CA097189, U01 CA154200), a P01 and P50 SPORE in thyroid cancer (P01 CA124570, P50 CA168505), a  P01 in epigenetics (CA129242) and two U01s in lung cancer (U01 CA152758, U01 CA166905). They are PIs  on CCSG-approved grants whose direct funding is currently $9.39 million, with $7.5 million in NCI funding  (80% of total CCSG-approved funding). Program members are principal investigators on 21 active protocols  that have accrued 5760 patients over the past five years. MBCG studies are predominantly interventional but  non-therapeutic, and non-interventional as most of our interventional therapeutic work is accomplished  collaboratively within the Translational Therapeutics and Leukemia Research Programs."
"9254569","Ebola virus (EBOV) is a dreaded virus that periodically emerges from its animal reservoir to cause serious and deadly epidemics. A recently developed replicating viral vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) was successfully used as a post-exposure vaccine for persons at high risk following exposure. However, this antibody-inducing vaccine has caused fever and arthritis in many healthy subjects which makes unsuitable to give as a prophylactic vaccine. Instead, work continues on developing a vaccine that generates protective CD8+ T cell responses against the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) protein. Unfortunately, the currently developed Adenoviral-based and MVA-based vaccines elicit a suboptimal CD8+ T cell response in humans. Consequently, this project will develop a new vaccine based on combining GP antigen with a highly effective, multi-trimer form of CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154). The vaccine design is based on a fusion protein comprised of the body of surfactant protein D (SPD) as a multimerization scaffold (SPD) combined with GP and the extracellular domain of CD40L (SPD-GP-CD40L). This is referred to as a Multi-Trimer Antigen Adjuvant Vaccine or ?MagaVax.? The Aims are to make the construct in an adenoviral vector, test its effectiveness at eliciting anti-GP CD8+ T cells in mice in vivo, and prepare a macaque version for eventual testing in monkeys. When these studies are complete, a MagaVax/EBOV vaccine will be ready for further testing and development as defense against Ebola."
"9146892","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Overtreatment, or the use of treatment where the burden significantly outweighs the benefits, is an important patient safety issue for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. According to clinical practice guidelines, not all patients with ESRD are appropriate for initiation or continuation of dialysis. The demands of the treatment may outweigh the benefits for these patients because dialysis may not adequately maintain or restore function and may cause or increase suffering.  In these situations, patients, their families, and their health care providers need to discuss either withholding or withdrawing dialysis treatment, and initiating palliative care; however, the literature suggests that these conversations are either not occurring or are occurring too late, often when patients are unable to speak for themselves. The majority of the palliative care research in ESRD has examined patients' expectations or preferences. There is a paucity of articles including nephrologists or nephrology fellows. Further, the majority of the latter research includes little or no examination of the interaction between patients and nephrologists regarding palliative care discussions. Some have conjectured about the barriers nephrologists may face, but no one has comprehensively explored this issue with nephrologists and nephrology fellows. Further, barriers to palliative care discussions identified among other disease specialists - e.g., oncologists - may not be the same as those faced by nephrologists, particularly since ESRD has no cure and requires continued treatment to sustain life. This multiphase mixed methods study of nephrologists and nephrology fellows is designed to address the research gaps. The purpose is to: 1) Explore the barriers and facilitators to discussions with patients and their families regarding palliative care as identified by nephrologists and nephrology fellows; 2) Rank order the barriers and facilitators to discussions with patients and their families regarding palliative care; and 3) Determine if there are differences in barriers by experience level (i.e., nephrology fellows versus practicing nephrologists). The first study phase consists of semi-structured interviews with nephrologists and nephrology fellows. The second phase uses a nominal group process in which nephrologists and nephrology fellows are asked to identify and rank barriers and facilitators to renal palliative care discussions. Because it is likely that multiple barriers nd facilitators will be identified, ranking of the top factors will allow for comparison between group, based on experience. Long term, this prioritization may be useful in developing skill-based training and curricula tailored to the needs of nephrologists and nephrology fellows."
"9126281","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have demonstrated that the physiological state of the lumbosacral spinal circuitry of spinal rats and cats can be modulated with spinal cord epidural stimulation (EDS) and/or administration of pharmacological agents to generate weight-bearing standing and stepping over a range of speeds, loads, and directions.  We have translated some of these results to humans by implanting 3 motor complete spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects about three years post-injury with an epidural electrode array over the lumbosacral spinal cord.  In less than one month post-electrode implant, the subjects could stand independently, and after up to 7 months of daily EDS and motor training, voluntary control of both legs was evident in the presence of EDS, whereas complete paralysis remained in absence of EDS.  We propose to employ a similar stimulation strategy for the recovery of upper limb function.  We will include extensive testing of spinal rats to guide our strategy to test for upper extremity improvement in human SCI subjects.  We will use off-the-shelf FDA approved pharmacological and stimulation modalities to:  1) Determine the optimal stimulation parameters, i.e., electrode placement and stimulation intensity, frequency and duration, for facilitating forelimb fine motor function in rats with a cervical SCI.  Using existing FDA-approved epidural electrodes, we will demonstrate in patients with a cervical SCI that cervical EDS can facilitate arm-hand function.  2) Identify an effective mode of administration, define the dose- response pharmacokinetics, and determine the effectiveness of a monoaminergic agonist to facilitate upper limb function after a cervical SCI.  We will assess the effectiveness of existing FDA-approved pharmacological agents (i.e., buspirone and as an alternative, bromocriptine), and determine their effectiveness in improving forelimb control in subjects with a cervical SCI.  3) Define the dose-response properties of monoaminergic agonists when combined with EDS in facilitating forelimb function in rats after a cervical SCI.  We will demonstrate the efficacy of ES in combination with a pharmacological intervention in facilitating arm and hand function in humans after a cervical SCI.  4) Determine whether motor training of spinal rats will further enhance the recovery of motor function when combined with pharmacological and/or EDS interventions.  5) Develop a protocol for machine learning to enable rapid selection of the optimal pharmacological and EDS parameters for motor recovery in rats and in human subjects.  If successful, this could represent the beginning of a paradigm shift in the use of minimally invasive strategies combined with rehabilitative approaches to realize significant improvement in upper limb function after paralysis."
"8998417","Project Summary  The Melanoma and Cutaneous Malignancies Program is a multidisciplinary Research Program that has been  supported by the NCI CCSG since 1978. It provides the organizational structure and research forum for the  efficient conduct of collaborative basic, clinical, and epidemiologic research in melanoma, basal and squamous  cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Lynn Schuchter, MD has been Program Leader since 2007,  after being an active member since 1989. John Seykora, MD, PhD was appointed Co-Leader in 2014 given the  expansion of the Program into non-melanoma skin cancers. Members have a high degree of collaboration with  other Research Programs and extramural investigators. The primary goal of the Program is to improve survival  and quality of life for patients with melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers and CTCL through basic,  translational, and clinical epidemiological research. Three highly translational thematic areas of scientific focus  include: epidemiology and risk assessment; the biology of cutaneous malignancies; and experimental  therapeutics, including both targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches. The cohesiveness of the Program is  maintained through several collaborative mechanisms (monthly research meetings, weekly tumor boards,  monthly research in progress meetings, a yearly retreat sponsored by the Cancer Center) and NCI-funded  multi-investigator research grants. The Program's 26 members are drawn from 11 departments from Penn's  Perelman School of Medicine and two departments from The Wistar Institute. Critically important resources  have been developed by Program members, and are supported by the Cancer Center, which have fostered the  highly productive, translational research that distinguishes this Program. The resources include a  comprehensive melanoma database; a melanoma pathology archive, from which investigators can access  annotated pathology slides and blocks (normal skin and lesions) of patients seen as far back as 30 years ago;  and a large biorepository of thousands of collected blood and tumor samples from patients with cutaneous  lymphoma. During the project period, the Program has been remarkably productive with numerous  investigator-initiated clinical trials and publications in high impact journals including New England Journal of  Medicine, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Cell, and Journal of Clinical Investigation. The success of these efforts  is reflected in the award of an NCI Skin Cancer SPORE and additional grants in laboratory-based translational  and population science research, including two NCI P01 grants to support innovative clinical/translational  research. In total, members have $4.1M in research funding (annual direct costs) of which $2.3M is peer-  reviewed and $1.5 is from the NCI. During the project period, members published 373 cancer-related  publications, of which 22% were intra-Programmatic, 30% were inter-Programmatic and 58% were multi-  institutional."

All four SPORE projects utilize Core B, which is critical to achieving their aims. It  is an indispensable component of our SPORE and leverages and expands (without duplicating) existing  pathology resources in our National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Simmons Cancer Center and Children?s  Medical Center. We deliver basic histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), tissue  microarrays, whole slide imaging, image analysis, and laser-capture microdissection services and make  available unique cancer tissue-derivatives such as primary cancer cell cultures and cell lines, cryopreserved  tissues, DNA, RNA and patient-derived xenografts (PDX or tumorgrafts). This Core provides expertise in  histomorphologic evaluation of human kidney tumors, human tumorgrafts in mice, kidney tumors in transgenic  and knockout animal models, and in the interpretation of IHC and ISH assays. The BPR Core develops IHC  and molecular assays and has experience in the deployment of CLIA-certified laboratory tests, such as our  BAP1 IHC test ? a popular assay developed by Dr. Kapur (Director, Core B) at UTSW and applied to >3000  samples from >10 institutions. The BPR Core currently has: >640 fresh frozen and >3000 paraffin-embedded  tissues from renal tumors, respectively; a unique live-tissue repository of >600 kidney tumor tissues viably  preserved in DMSO that are amenable to mechanistic studies to address questions arising from genomic and  other studies of inert tissues; 90 independent orthotopically-passaged tumorgraft lines, including lines from rare  tumors (such as Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and RCC); >75 primary tumor cell lines representing a wide  variety of banked tumors; and integrated genomic analyses (exome sequencing, RNA-Seq, and SNP data)  from >300 tumors. The BPR Core provides routine quality controls for SPORE investigators to ensure that the  tissues are optimal, and several of our protocols have been published in Nature Protocols and serve as  benchmarks in the fields of tissue processing for integrated genomic analyses and tumorgraft utilization for  preclinical drug testing. Our repository has had significant utilization, with >1000 samples having been shipped  to collaborators both internally, as well as externally. Tumorgrafts have been extensively utilized to evaluate  RCC drug sensitivity, study radiation responsiveness, explore tumor biomarkers, understand cancer biology  (including tumor-induced cachexia and paraneoplastic syndromes), and dissect metabolic derangements in  RCC. Studies with these tissues have been published in high-impact journals such as Nature Genetics, Nature  Communications, and Lancet Oncology. Our Core promotes flourishing collaborations among our SPORE  investigators, investigators from other SPOREs, and other investigators in academia and industry."
"9148078","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, there is a 1 in 4 risk of developing depression by age 75, and by 2030 depression will be one of the leading causes of disease burden world-wide. For the past half-decade, the treatment of depression has been dominated by drugs that affect a group of molecules called the monoamines, with serotonin being the most commonly targeted. While effective for some people (30-50%), those that remain without relief have few options for therapy, as newer drug strategies have been hard to come by. Within the last few decades, it has become more and more apparent that changes in the activity and connections within the brain heavily influence the development of depression. Specifically, the hippocampus, a brain region important for emotion and memory, has been shown to be integral to depression's development. Our lab studies a unique protein in the brain called the Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic-Nucleotide gated channel (HCN), which helps to regulate the flow of electricity from cell to cell. By doing this, the channel has an integral rolein solidifying and maintaining the connections between individual neurons and, ultimately, whole brain regions. Recently, we and others showed that a loss of these channels in the hippocampus has a distinct antidepressant-like effect in mice. Given this finding, we propose to study the roles of HCN in the development and treatment of depression, and hypothesize that HCN channels increase with depression-like behavior, and reduction of HCN channels correlate with a reduction in depression-like behavior. Specifically, we hypothesize that HCN is increased with depression-like behavior in chronically stressed mice (Aim1), that HCN subunit knock- out protects stressed mice from depression-like behavior (Aim 2.1), viral overexpression of HCN subunits in the hippocampus increase depression-like behavior (Aim 2.2), and antidepressants decrease HCN subunits (Aim 3)."
"9353494","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A long-term goal of the BRAIN Initiative is to track activity in large numbers of neurons individually in behaving animals, thus capturing the information processing that is done by brain circuitry. A universal signal in neurons when they are active is the messenger ion calcium. By examining changes in calcium concentration following each action potential in an individual neuron, researchers can track that neuron's activity, but at present, the time resolution of this approach is limited. The overall objective of this application is to use calcium-sensitive probes in spike-counting mode to detect individual action potentials as discrete events in space and time. The proposed experiments will produce new technology that can follow activity with millisecond resolution in hundreds to thousands of neurons at once. This contribution is significant because it will allow researchers to image important neural circuits noninvasively with millisecond resolution in awake animals. This approach is innovative because the investigators will use a novel, ultrafast response mode of a highly popular calcium sensor protein to obtain time resolution that is not otherwise possible. The work proposed in this application therefore advances our ability to understand how the brain functions in health and disease. In the long run, this information could lead to new approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a variety of brain disorders."

"9202572","Project Summary In 2014, approximately 6 million Americans with diabetes were living with the accompanying condition diabetic retinopathy, which is the largest cause of blindness among working-age individuals in the United States. During the progression of DR, ischemic neuronal cells in the retina begin to express vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), leading to macular edema and retinal neovascularization. Inhibition of VEGF-A has become an important approach to ameliorate the sequelae of DR, though current anti-VEGF drugs are rapidly cleared from the vitreous and require frequent administration by intravitreal injection to maintain an effective treatment concentration. Valitor, Inc. is developing protein-polymer therapeutics to overcome the vision- threatening effects of DR. As one example of our patented technology platform, we have conjugated soluble VEGF receptor-1 (sFlt) to linear chains of the natural biopolymer hyaluronic acid (HyA) to generate multivalent conjugates of sFlt (mvsFlt) that are substantially larger than any drugs currently delivered by intravitreal injection. Increasing the size of the mvsFlt conjugates will substantially reduce their clearance rate out of the vitreous, and we have preliminary evidence that mvsFlt conjugates retained within eye can effectively antagonize VEGF-A signaling in the retina, where the VEGF-induced pathologies associated with DR occur. We have designed our mvsFlt therapy to provide sustained anti-VEGF bioactivity following administration by intravitreal injection, which will allow for effective therapy with less frequent treatment sessions. Thus, our strategy for sustained anti-VEGF therapy has the potential to improve both the safety and cost efficacy of DR treatment. Our Phase I objective is to demonstrate that increasing the macromolecular size of mvsFlt conjugates will increase the duration of effective DR treatment. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine how mvsFlt size will affect both its localization within the eye and its ability to provide sustained anti-VEGF therapy. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the intravitreal half-life of mvsFlt conjugates using a model that will allow direct comparison to published data for clinically available anti-VEGF drugs. Our findings will provide valuable proof-of-mechanism data for further pre-clinical development of our drug product, which we have planned for Phase II of this project."

"9236386","The Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, and Facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, with the vast majority of cases carrying mutations in either the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3B (ICF1) or the zinc finger protein gene ZBTB24 (ICF2). A hallmark of ICF syndrome is loss of DNA methylation in specific genomic regions, which is believed to be the primary defect underlying other phenotypic abnormalities, including antibody deficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia), facial dysmorphism, and mental retardation. Patients with ICF syndrome usually die of recurrent infections in early childhood. Although ICF syndrome was first reported nearly four decades ago, little progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, largely because of the lack of appropriate in vitro and in vivo models. Modeling ICF syndrome using Dnmt3b mutant mice has been a challenge, because complete inactivation of Dnmt3b leads to embryonic lethality and mice carrying ICF-like point mutations fail to recapitulate antibody deficiency. Preliminary data from the applicant's laboratory revealed that Zbtb24 depletion in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) results in substantial Dnmt3b downregulation and DNA methylation alterations characteristic of ICF syndrome and that conditional Zbtb24 deletion in the hematopoietic lineage leads to severe hypogammaglobulinemia in mice, apparently due to defects in plasma cell differentiation or survival. The objective of this application is to determine the role of Zbtb24 in the regulation of DNA methylation and antibody production. The central hypothesis is that Zbtb24, via regulating Dnmt3b expression, controls DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin structure in lymphocyte populations that are important for antibody production. The applicant proposes to use Zbtb24-deficient ESCs to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Zbtb24 regulates Dnmt3b expression and determine the impacts of Zbtb24 deficiency on DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin structure (aim 1). The applicant also proposes to use the Zbtb24-mutant ICF mouse model to determine the cellular defects involved in antibody deficiency and elucidate the links between aberrant DNA methylation and the defects in gene expression, chromatin structure and molecular signaling that contribute to antibody deficiency (aim 2). The project is significant, because results from the proposed work will not only fundamentally advance mechanistic understanding of ICF syndrome, but could also shed light on the etiology and defects underlying other antibody deficiency diseases, including common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). These results will also have general implications in understanding the role of epigenetic mechanisms in immunity and immunological disorders. The project has potential translational impact as well, because results from the proposed work could lead to identification of novel therapeutic strategies for ICF syndrome and other immunodeficiency diseases, and the innovative ICF mouse model could be valuable for preclinical testing of therapeutics in the future."
"9254700","Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the US. More than 5 million people in the US currently have AD and the direct health care cost is over $200 billion per year. Detection of early phase of AD, namely Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), can delay, prevent, and treat this serious disease. The project will develop a clinically-feasible system for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnostics and prognostics, by integrating multi-modality imaging data such as MRI and PET as well as non-imaging data such as clinical assessments, biomarkers, demographics, and genetic information. This project involves three Aims. In Aim #1, we will develop the system by designing diagnostic and prognostic modeling using cross-sectionally incomplete multi-modality data by multitask learning. Our multitask-learning approach that will simultaneously model multiple related tasks by allowing effective knowledge and data sharing to jointly estimate the diagnostic/prognostic models for each patient cohort. In Aim #2, we will update diagnostic and prognostic model using longitudinally incomplete multi-modality data by transfer learning. We will integrate the model of an old domain (e.g., the diagnostic/prognostic model obtained at an earlier time point) and the data of a new domain (e.g., new data obtained at the a follow-up visit), in order to obtain an updated model with better accuracy. This can take care of incomplete longitudinal data due to patient drop-off, because it transfers the old- domain model not the data. In Aim #3 we will conduct validation for the proposed models using the MCI data collected by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for all phases of AD. The current project is novel in creating a first-of-its-kind clinically-feasible technology for personalized MCI diagnostics and prognostics as well as in using ?multitask learning? and ?transfer learning? machine learning methods for modeling cross-sectionally and longitudinally incomplete multi-modality data. It is innovative in using multitask learning to model incomplete cross-sectional data (e.g., baseline data) and using transfer learning to model the incomplete longitudinal data."
"9350830","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and visual morbidity. Because the disease causes irreversible damage to neural tissue it is of upmost importance to identify glaucoma and its progression at the earliest possible stages. Through advancements in the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and other technologies, the long-term goal of this research project is to precisely and accurately detect ocular structural and functional changes associated with glaucoma and to identify eyes with glaucoma that are at risk for future disease progression. This is accomplished by consolidating our long-term data acquired from various generations of OCT technology over the last 19 years. By using innovative methods for image quality improvement along with signal morphing, it is now possible to reliably bridge data acquired by the different generations and manufacturers of OCT, creating the longest-term cohort of longitudinal OCT measurements of the retina and optic nerve head regions. Advanced retinal segmentation software will be applied enabling detailed discrimination of all retinal layers even in the presence of ocular co-morbidity coincident with glaucoma (a previous exclusion criteria), allowing maximal use of subject and patient data. Using this cohort, two methods will be uniquely applied for determining the long-term relationship between structure and function: Continuous-time hidden Markov model and Latent differential equation models. This would enhance understanding of the disease process and allow determination of the best methods to identify disease and its progression at various stages.  We will utilize advanced innovative imaging technologies and methods to accurately and precisely detect evidence of early structural changes: Swept-source OCT, Adaptive-optics OCT and Polarization-sensitive OCT. These technologies will be used to image the retina, sclera and optic nerve head providing enhanced information of the lamina cribrosa and birefringence properties. Scans will be also acquired during and following provocative acute IOP elevation testing to asses the morphological and biomechanical responses as potential markers for current and future disease characterization.  The outcomes of this research project will provide an innovative and enhanced evaluation of ocular structure and function in glaucoma that will expand our understanding of the disease pathophysiology, offer new diagnostic tools for early disease detection and disease progression and identify subjects at risk for rapid glaucoma progression."
"9230600","Nicotine is considered to be the main addictive ingredient in tobacco. Therefore, the nicotine content of tobacco products serves as a logical target in the development of effective tobacco-control policies. In an influential article, Benowitz and Henningfield proposed that the gradual reduction of the nicotine content of cigarettes to an amount below an addictive threshold could prevent the development of nicotine addiction among young smokers. More recently, a similar addictive threshold was proposed for electronic cigarettes (EC) based on their rate of nicotine delivery. Accordingly, if an EC delivers nicotine at rates above a certain, yet undetermined threshold, they can be addictive and potentially harmful, especially in nicotine naïve users. In contrast, if the nicotine delivery rate of an EC is below a critical threshold, it may have low addiction liability but provide sufficient nicotine delivery to help smokers quit smoking by alleviating urges to smoke and reducing tobacco withdrawal symptoms. This proposed critical rate of delivery that underlies the addictive effects of nicotine, however, has yet to be empirically validated by controlled human studies. This knowledge gap is partly due to the difficulty in accurately controlling the rate of nicotine delivery with currently available nicotine delivery products like tobacco cigarettes or EC. To close this knowledge gap, we propose to use intravenous (IV) nicotine administration because the rate of nicotine exposure by the IV and inhaled routes are comparable. IV nicotine administration also allows for accurate dosing over a wide range of delivery rates. We propose a placebo-controlled study that will enroll male and female tobacco smokers (n=18) who will participate in four experimental sessions. During the experimental session, subjects will be given an IV infusion of either saline or 1 mg nicotine at rapid, moderate or slow infusion rates (nicotine at 0.24, 0.05 and 0.02, µg per kg body weight per sec). The infusion conditions for each experimental session will be determined in random order. Aim 1 is to establish a dose-effect curve for nicotine reinforcement as a function of nicotine delivery rate. Aim 2 is to establish a dose-effect curve for nicotine's positive and negative subjective effects as a function of nicotine delivery rate. Aim 3 is to establish a dose-effect curve for nicotine's effect to alleviate symptoms of nicotine withdrawal in abstinent smokers as a function of nicotine delivery rate. Aim 4 is to establish a dose-effect curve for nicotine's acute cardiovascular health effects. Data from this project will help to establish benchmark values for nicotine's threshold effects that will guide policies on the nicotine yield of tobacco products."
"9074441","Abstract - Project 2 (Role of Lysosomal Scavenging in PDAC Metabolism)  Kras mutation (KRAS*) is the signature genetic alteration in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that  our P01 team and others have demonstrated to be critical to disease genesis and maintenance. While  inhibitors of KRAS* have proven difficult to develop, alterations in cellular metabolism have emerged as  promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, we have discovered that a major function of KRAS* in  tumor maintenance is to orchestrate the profound metabolic rewiring of PDAC cells, including alterations in  glucose and glutamine utilization. Furthermore, we have broadly elucidated additional metabolic dependencies  of KRAS* PDAC. PDAC exhibit a strikingly high level of nutrient scavenging via autophagy and  macropinocytosis. These processes converge at the lysosome where cargo (extracellular, from  macropinocytosis; intracellular, from autophagy) is degraded and the resulting metabolites are recycled for  use in anabolic and bioenergetic pathways. Indeed we and others have shown that these scavenging  processes are critical for PDAC growth and metabolic homeostasis. We have also identified a regulatory  network responsible for induction and integration of these recycling pathways. Based on these findings, the  goals of Project 2 are to: 1) identify the metabolic outputs of these lysosomal pathways and how they integrate  with cellular metabolism; 2) decipher the circuits that reprogram PDAC to rely on these pathways; 3) define  signatures predicting reliance on these pathways; and 4) identify combinatorial approaches that effectively  target this dependency and prevent metabolic escape. Our highly integrated joint studies will explore these  processes in cells that escape Kras* inactivation (with Project 1) and in innovative models for tumor-stroma  interactions (with Project 3), and depend on the Cores for tissue, drug screening, therapeutics and  computational resources. Given ongoing clinical trials with the lysosomal inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine, these  studies can have a transformative impact on PDAC treatment. At the same time, the full translational potential  of our work requires integrated understanding of synergies/interferences of targeting salvage pathways,  metabolic processes, Kras* effectors, Kras* bypass mechanisms and immune cells. The need for this integrated  view is a central rationale of the P01 program.    "
"9270471","Coal tar is a complex mixture of chemicals known to include a variety of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, some of which are listed as Group 1 Human Carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Occupational exposure assessments suggest that significant airborne levels may be present during the actual coal tar sealant application work. There is a large workforce potentially exposed to coal tar pitch volatiles (considered potential occupational carcinogens by NIOSH), but occupational exposure levels are unknown and require assessment.   Exposure to coal tar PAHs will be assessed using: occupational air sampling and analysis to quantify exposures to PAHs/coal tar pitch volatiles; collection and analysis of urine samples to allow assessment of biomarkers of internal PAH exposure levels; collection of blood samples for analysis of biomarkers of effect potentially related to PAH exposure; collection and analysis of dermal wipe samples for assessment of dermal exposure.  Bulk samples of sealant used during surveys will be provided to NTP for use in evaluation of polycyclic aromatic mixtures in a separate research program.  In FY16, the study protocol was amended to allow for area monitoring and collection of additional skin wipe sampling.  The amended protocol was IRB approved in Q4FY16. One site visit was conducted which monitored coal tar sealant applicators over multiple days.  Contacts are being made to identify companies for site visits and six field surveys are planned for FY17."
"9238569","Abstract  Over 30% of neuropathic pain conditions in Veterans are due to peripheral nerve injury from physical or surgical related trauma. Peripheral nerve injury often results in the formation of neuroma/nerve entrapment, a persistent neuropathic pain state accompanied by sensory hypersensitivity and uncontrollable spontaneous pain sensation at the injury site. Current available medications for neuropathic pain often consist of untoward side effects and/or abusive risks. Invasive measures such as surgical resection or local injections of steroid and local anesthetics at the injury/neuroma site are often ineffective in alleviating the symptoms and the invasive nature of the procedure is usually painful for the patients. Therefore, there is a need in the field of pain management in developing means of non-invasive and non-contact therapy in treating post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (PTP-NP) states. The pain service at the VA San Diego Healthcare System (VASDHS) has recently adopted the use of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (tMS) in treating PTP-NP and noticed encouraging pain relief benefit in patients with PTP-NP. The PI also completed a mechanistic nerve conduction study and showed that this treatment method can potentially restore lost neuronal functions associated with PTP-NP. Our initial pilot data from a randomized controlled study support the feasibility of conducting a larger scale randomized controlled clinical trial to adequately assess the effect of tMS in treating PTP-NP and improving patients' function. To validate tMS as a non-contact and non-invasive pain treatment option for reducing pain in Veterans with PTP-NP and improving their overall functions, the proposed study will assess: 1) the effect of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (tMS) in alleviating post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (PTP-NP); 2) the effect of tMS in improving quality of life and functions in Veterans with PTP-NP."
"9146891","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a cornerstone intervention in modern intensive and emergency care that is used to support hundreds of thousands of individuals each year while they cannot breathe independently. Unfortunately, this lifesaving intervention can cause harm: injudicious ventilator settings can promote lung injury, compromise circulatory stability, produce patient distress, stimulate an inflammatory response, and prolong the period of support required. Such adverse consequences of mechanical ventilation add to the burden of patient suffering, increase healthcare resource utilization, and compromise outcomes. Each year, relatively few practitioners receive detailed training in mechanical ventilation. Consequently, individuals requiring MV may be managed by practitioners with limited or spotty training in this intervention. In addition, the teaching of mechanical ventilation remains primarily a bedside exercise more akin to an apprenticeship than a systematic approach to mastery. New learners cannot practice extensively on actual patients, for ethical and practical reasons, and physiologically realistic alternatives are expensive and suffer from limited access. Moreover, exposure of the practitioner to the full spectrum of possible mechanical or physiologic derangements cannot be guaranteed. Those who are taught may not be taught well. Contemporary approaches to the assessment of expertise in mechanical ventilation are ill-suited for defining clinician practice patterns or competence in the context of a potentially harmful intervention for which any patient problem may have many possible solutions, the prevailing physiology is highly dynamic, and the clinician is reasoning in the setting of uncertainty. Similarly, ascertaining the extent to which a practitioner maintains her or his skills is hampered by the lack of clear metrics. We will address these three concerns by: 1. Developing an Internet deployable simulator in which learners confront and manage a carefully constructed population of virtual patients suffering from common cardiopulmonary maladies; 2. Developing and applying state of the art pattern recognition approaches to define practice patterns adopted by experts and novices as they manage virtual patients who require cardiopulmonary support; 3. Comparing the effectiveness of 3 different approaches to training: presentation based, simulation based, and simulation based training that adapts to focus on the learner's weak areas; 4. Elucidating the consequences of time away from training and simultaneous management of multiple virtual patients on provider performance. The proposed body of work will produce a cardiopulmonary management training tool deployable as freeware via the Internet, a database of expert and novice practice patterns, information regarding optimal training strategies, and data regarding compromise of provider performance by two relevant issues."

"9162423","Project Summary Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, institutional death, and are less likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase access to palliative care must maximize primary palliative care and community based models to meet the ever growing need in a culturally-sensitive and congruent manner. Patient navigator interventions are community based, culturally tailored models of care and have been successfully implemented to improve disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. We have developed and implemented a patient navigation intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for seriously ill hospitalized Latinos. We have demonstrated feasibility and early findings suggest this intervention can improve palliative care outcomes for Latinos with advanced cancer. Building on this prior research, we propose a fully powered randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator intervention in a non-cancer population. A total of 240 Latino adults with non-cancer, advanced medical illness enrolled from 8 urban and 4 rural clinical sites will be randomized to the intervention group (5 palliative care-related patient navigator visits plus educational materials) or control group (usual care plus educational materials). Participants randomized to the intervention group will demonstrate better quality of life, will be more likely to have a palliative approach to their care, have higher rates of advance care planning, better pain and symptom control, and higher rates of hospice utilization compared to the control group). We will conduct a cost analysis of the patient navigator intervention by comparing direct costs of the intervention and cost and utilization of health care system resources across the study arms. Participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the 6 months following study enrollment compared to participants in the control arm. Decedent participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the last 3 months of life compared to decedent participants in the control arm. For the intervention visits, bicultural, bilingual navigators (guias) integrate core Latino values, while addressing barriers to a palliative approach through education, culturally tailored messaging, and patient activation. Patients will be interviewed at baseline and 3 months using the QUAL- E quality of life scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and the Patient Navigator Process and Outcomes Measure. Medical records will be reviewed to assess advance directive completion, hospice and health care utilization and intensity of care at the end of life. This culturally tailored, evidence-based, theory driven, highly innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential to improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate true health equity in palliative and end of life care."
"9253580","Project Summary/Abstract Recent research shows that many individuals with neuromuscular, neurological, and developmental disorders, including those suffering physical injury or tremors, are at a higher risk of poor oral health, including more dental caries, periodontal disease, and soft tissue pathology compared to those without disability. This population of roughly 52 million disabled Americans encounter barriers to routine, comfortable, and effective oral hygiene self-care, resulting from problems with grasp, muscle control, range of motion, and reduced manual dexterity. Many of these individuals require assistance from caregivers to perform daily oral hygiene, reducing independence. Caregivers often report great difficulty in safely and comfortably performing these services due to lack of training, time, or confidence in managing the complexities of oral hygiene care. Surveys of current devices to assist in the daily oral care for disabled persons show only limited manual solutions, including potentially uncomfortable props to keep the mouth open and modified grips for standard toothbrushes. Current electric toothbrushes still require a degree of manual control. Inadequate daily hygiene promotes oral disease in disabled individuals, who are subjected to dental care access barriers by limited financial resources, inadequate Medicaid dental coverage and providers, and a limited pool of professionals proficient in the care of the disabled. Thus, a significant unmet need exists to support daily routines for those with oral hygiene disabilities and their caregivers with a safe, automatic, affordable, easily operated, effective solution to facilitate regular oral care and reduce caregiver burden. As an effective and novel approach to reduce difficulties and apprehension while increasing adherence and safety, ASTER Labs, Inc. proposes to construct a hands-free automatic system in the form of a comfortable mouthpiece to simplify routine oral hygiene care. The device will operate using powered, automatically moving bristles and is simply inserted into the mouth to automatically remove plaque and debris. The mouthpiece includes embedded sensors to adjust the firmness and speed of the bristle motion, and to wirelessly transmit usage information to caregivers monitoring adherence and status. The goal of this new easily operated device is to increase plaque removal, oral care frequency, and adherence, to help reduce the risk of oral disease in individuals whose disabilities may interfere with use of standard oral hygiene devices. This will also reduce burden and emotional stress on caregivers. An LCD display on the recharging base station and wireless status reports will further promote adherence by helping prevent disruptions in daily hygiene leading to deterioration in oral health. The system design includes multiple safety features to ensure patient comfort and well-being during daily care. By providing a technically advanced and practical dental care system for those with oral hygiene disabilities and their caregivers to use in the comfort of a home or care facility, regular and effective oral hygiene can be improved, reducing the burden of preventable oral disease and treatment need in this vulnerable population."

"9171430","Project Summary  Lipids control many critical biological processes, and aberrant lipid production and localization lead to the onset of many diseases. In spite of this significance, many critical details of lipid biosynthesis and trafficking remain poorly understood due to longstanding impediments to tracking lipid biosynthesis and subcellular localization. Herein, we present a comprehensive plan for overcoming these challenges by developing synthetic probes that act as tagged analogs of biosynthetic precursors of lipids, thus enabling the detection and imaging of derivatized products in their native environment and in real time. Towards this end, we are first designing and synthesizing analogs of lipid precursors containing small tags that can be modified using click chemistry to achieve the selective labeling of lipid products within cells. In this endeavor, a number of metabolite analog designs are being pursued to optimize labeling of lipid products and to access compounds that label different lipid products depending on their specific structures. Following synthesis, each compound will be rigorously evaluated to assess incorporation into different potential products and to optimize infiltration of biosynthetic pathways. A range of tools will be exploited and developed for this purpose, including mass spectrometry-based tracking of lipid products in biological samples, TLC analysis to confirm the families of lipids that are labeled, in vitro assays to probe the ability of synthetic compounds to act as substrates for enzymatic modification, and fluorescence microscopy to confirm the production of lipid products and characterize product localization. Once each of these analytical approaches has been optimized, these platforms will be implemented to answer biological questions pertaining to the localization of lipids during biosynthesis and trafficking events. These studies will be accomplished by applying the proposed mass spectrometry and fluorescence microscopy methods in conjunction with a series of mutant cell lines with modified lipid biosynthetic machinery as well as cellular fractionation experiments."
"9270751","Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are potentially important and modifiable social determinants of adolescent HIV risk. While the relationship between ACE and sexual health has been documented in the US other high-income contexts with concentrated epidemics, evidence from lower-income high-HIV prevalence contexts is largely missing. Moreover, no study has considered how adversities cluster and compound across the life course, interact across ecological levels, and contribute to a common causal chain culminating in HIV infection. The proposed project will create an adolescent cohort that has been traced since birth by building on exceptional existing data provided by parents in the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH; established in 1998). We propose collecting two new rounds of prospective data directly from the MLSFH children as they reach adolescence; in doing so, we will establish a cohort that is currently entering a critical age-range for HIV risk as they transition to adulthood. The aims are: Aim 1. To describe the prevalence, co-occurrence and re-occurrence of Adverse Childhood Experiences among adolescents in a HIV-endemic low-income country. We will construct indicators of ACE covering the period from infancy to adolescence by linking 1) rich data captured through parental reporting in prior MLSFH waves and 2) new data collected from adolescents (at age 11-15 and at 14-18) using the Adverse Childhood Experiences ? International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) recently developed by the WHO. Aim 2. To estimate the causal impact of ACE on the emergence of differentiated HIV risk trajectories during adolescence. By applying sophisticated statistical methods, we will be able to examine the causal role of early and ongoing adversities on the emergence of HIV risk, including 1) poor transitions to adulthood 2) behavioral risk and 3) HIV and HSV2 incidence. Aim 3. To highlight potential intervention points by identifying causal mediators between ACE and HIV risk. We focus on social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that may result from frequent or chronic activation of the stress response and may also contribute to social or behavioral HIV risk. Aim 4: To identify protective factors that moderate the impact of ACE on HIV risk. We will test potential multi-level sources of resilience (e.g., family resources, peer support, government programs) that may determine how children cope could be enhanced through intervention. A rigorous evaluation of the consequences, mediators, and moderators of childhood adversity on adolescent HIV risk will greatly enhance current HIV prevention strategies in low income countries by explaining why some adolescents engage in high risk behaviors and contract HIV while others do not, and by identifying modifiable targets for intervention. By integrating the project into an ongoing longitudinal study, we rapidly create a birth cohort, facilitate causal inference, ensure timely findings, and add value to an existing, widely-used resource for research on HIV and health in sub-Saharan Africa."

"9215587","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  For the 3 million patients with breast cancer who have survived the initial treatment phase, routine surveillance for recurrence does not improve outcomes. Although it is possible, using imaging or blood tests, to find cancer recurrence before it produces symptoms or signs, large randomized controlled trials and Cochrane database systematic reviews have found that such surveillance offers no benefit in terms of survival or quality of life for patients with breast cancer. Testing, if unwarranted, involves unnecessary risks to the patient including radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and potential false positives resulting in unnecessary work-up that carries its own risks.  Despite the evidence and guidelines advising against it, there is evidence that surveillance testing often occurs after initial treatment of breast cancer. Recent single institution and group model HMO studies and an older national study found evidence of that advanced imaging is used in about half of patients with early stage breast cancers. There is little information about surveillance using blood tests for tumor markers.  Our long-term goal is to develop an improved understanding of drivers of surveillance test use and its impact on outcomes and to identify potential interventions to steer provider and patient behavior to improved outcomes and reduced cost (financial and radiation risk). Once the significant drivers of surveillance test use are identified, this information can be used to improve value of care in at least three ways. First, patients will have a better understanding of the potential risks?in terms of cost and radiation exposure?associated with surveillance testing. Second, since the US spends over $4 billion per year on imaging and other tests related to cancer care, even a small reduction in the utilization of expensive unnecessary surveillance tests would represent significant financial savings without increasing mortality. Third, if providers understand the effect, or lack of effect, of modern methods of surveillance testing on patient outcomes, including financial burden, radiation risk, and mortality, their willingness to adhere to guidelines, and patient outcomes, could improve.  In this project we will create estimates of the variation in surveillance testing use nationally, and will generate the first data regarding the association between provider characteristics and practice patterns and surveillance testing rates (Aims 1 and 3). We will provide the first data on the impact of surveillance on patient and societal outcomes, for the first time estimating the costs of and radiation exposure due to testing done that is not consistent with guidelines (Aim 2 and 4). Finally, we will create the first qualitative data to allow us to generate hypotheses about why surveillance occurs, which could be used to develop interventions to reduce unnecessary testing that can be tested in future randomized trials."
"9153106","Post-acute care is one of the fastest growing areas of US healthcare spending. About 40% of older Americans discharged from a hospital utilize post-acute care, and spending in this area has more than doubled in the past decade. To hold providers responsible for longitudinal care, Medicare is testing accountable care organizations (ACOs) in two pilot programs: the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and the Pioneer ACO program. The impact of these efforts on both Medicare spending and patient outcomes remains uncertain, however. To the extent that post-acute care (PAC) spending is reduced, understanding whether lower costs occur through reductions in the quantity or intensity of post-acute care, or both, will be important. Furthermore, ACOs vary widely in their organizational structure and risk models (e.g., stronger vs. weaker PAC engagement; and more vs. less risk-sharing). The magnitude of any changes in PAC utilization will plausibly be modified by ACO heterogeneity. Apart from the effects of ACOs on post-acute care utilization and spending, there is also considerable uncertainty about how any changes in post-acute care will impact key clinical outcomes such as mortality. Therefore, we propose to use national Medicare data to carry out three aims: 1) To evaluate the impact of ACOs on post-acute care spending and utilization; 2) To describe how ACO heterogeneity modifies ACOs? effects on post-acute care spending; and 3) To evaluate the impact of changes in post- acute care spending and utilization on patient outcomes."
"9260644","Project Summary/Abstract The pathophysiology underlying the motor symptoms of Parkinson?s disease (PD) remains incompletely understood with recent conflicting reports of changes in neuronal activity in distinct nodes within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) motor circuit. A unified approach that accounts for conflicting results is needed. Emphasizing the relatively underexplored dynamic relationship between nodes in the circuit, we build upon the hypothesis that exaggerated network-level coupling is the pathophysiologic process underlying the rigidity and bradykinesia of PD by impeding effective information flow. Accordingly, we propose that modulation of network coupling is the common therapeutic mechanism across pharmacologic and surgical therapies; other physiologic sequelae are specific to the target of therapeutic intervention and account for disparate results in the literature. We will simultaneously assess cortical and subcortical physiology in relation to clinical symptoms and in response to deep brain stimulation (DBS), cortical stimulation and pharmacologic therapy in patients undergoing DBS implantation surgery. This approach enables superior investigation of spatially specific cortical phenomena compared to extraoperative studies. We propose that it is critically important to understand the functional connectivity of the extended BGTC network, including not only the motor cortex with subthalamic nucleus (STN) as most studies do, but also connectivity with globus pallidus internus (GPi, the final common output of the basal ganglia) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), which are to where pallidal-receiving thalamic regions dominantly project. Moreover, our analyses will focus on the differential physiological significance of low vs high ? oscillations with respect to normal motor function, disease, and therapeutic intervention. In Specific Aim 1, we aim to understand the clinical correlates of the untreated BGTC motor network in PD both at rest and with movement, taking specific advantage of temporal variation in disease symptomatology (as measured with objective clinical rating scales and comprehensive kinematics) with simultaneously recorded measures of network connectivity. In Specific Aim 2, we will use subcortical and cortical stimulation to specifically perturb distinct nodes in the BGTC motor network, in order to confirm that network coupling is the common mechanism underlying therapeutic brain stimulation, regardless of target, and to also identify target specific effects that can account for known clinical differences in DBS at STN vs GPi. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate pharmacologic modulation of the BGTC motor network, with an aim to understand the temporal relationships between symptom amelioration and network modulation. Taken together, we will significantly enhance the existing BGTC motor network wiring diagram by elucidating the role of motor network coupling in PD. Addressing this fundamental knowledge gap will facilitate therapeutic innovations, including identification of control signals that can be used for closed loop DBS as well as provide a wiring diagram of the BGTC motor circuit that could guide pharmacologic innovation."
"9072860","ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this project is to develop computational methods for studying tumor growth, and to relate  growth parameters to patient characteristics and prognosis. We hypothesize that tumor growth parameters will  allow us to define cancer phenotypes that help resolve cancer heterogeneity, and thereby improve power in  analyses that try to link germline genetic variation and internal/external environment to phenotypic variation  (Projects 1 & 3).  When discovered, human tumors vary in size and extent of spread. Although it is impossible to look directly  back in time to see how the tumor grew, it is possible to reconstruct the past with ?molecular phylogeny?. The  approach is analogous to reconstructing the genealogy of species using DNA sequences. In previous work, we  developed a molecular phylogeny approach to study human cancers using DNA methylation patterns and  found that a relatively simple exponential growth model fits most colorectal cancers. We now propose to test  and further develop the model by integrating new independent molecular data types. The experimental data  sample glands from opposite tumor sides and measures passenger DNA methylation patterns, chromosome  copy number, and point mutations. Each data type provides `molecular clocks' with different rates of sequence  evolution, such that their joint analysis permits our setting a new goal of characterizing what happens during  the first few cell divisions following transformation, even before a tumor is clinically detectable. We hypothesize  that abnormal cell mobility, a prerequisite for subsequent invasion and metastasis, is a phenotype that can be  measured immediately after tumor initiation in some cancers but not benign tumors (?Born to be Bad?). This  work will provide a new understanding of intratumor heterogeneity and cancer cell behavior, and might well be  the catalyst for the development of new treatment or prognostic paradigms. We will use approximate Bayesian  computation to estimate model parameters in this high-dimensional setting. This requires the development of  software, and implementation of methods for choosing an optimal set of statistics and corresponding weights  for parameter inference. These tools will be applicable to any ABC analysis, and not just our own. As such, we  will make this software publicly available to the wider community.  The present application uses data from colon cancer to develop the methods and software tools for inferring  tumor growth, but the approach is generalizable to any adenocarcinomas, or tumors with glandular structure  (e.g. prostate, kidney, lung, breast and more)."
"9181225","Project Summary  Here we propose to develop and integrate a suite of experimental and computational tools to measure the visual response and network properties of a large population of neurons in the mouse superior colliculus (SC), to determine how these properties change during locomotion, and the contribution of cortical and specific retinal inputs to these properties. The mouse SC is a subcortical area that integrates vision with touch and hearing to initiate orienting movements of the eyes and head, and is an attractive model to study how specific circuits form during development. Our development of high-density, high-channel count silicon probes to record neural activity has several significant advantages compared to alternative methods: (1) high efficiency for recording neuron spatial and temporal visual response properties; (2) the ability to rapidly study the topological/functional organization in a large neuron population over a wide field of view in a uniform way in a single animal; (3) the possibility to study correlated activity and connectivity among neurons as well as network rhythms; (4) the ability to ascertain differences in visual responses associated with behavioral state such as locomotion.  Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will measure the functional and topological properties of visually- responsive neurons in the SC of mice that are awake and head-fixed on a freely-floating Styrofoam ball used as a spherical treadmill. For each neuron, the spatial receptive field (RF), the temporal filtering spike-triggered average (STA), direction and orientation selectivity, and the non-linearity of spatial summation will be determined and correlated with its location in the SC and correlated with locomotion.  Aim 2 will apply the recording and data analysis tools developed in Aim 1 toward understanding the changes in circuitry in mutant mice that lack cortical inputs to the SC or lack On-Off direction selecive retinal ganglion cells (DS RGCs). This will allow us to determine the contribution of the cortex and DS RGCs toward the receptive field properties of SC neurons.  Upon completion, a comprehensive classification of SC neurons, their topological organization, and their coding properties will be in hand. We will then take advantage of the ever-expanding availability of genetic tools (including optogenetics) that alter visual function, and mouse models of complex neurological disease that have altered activity patterns such as autism and schizophrenia. These same techniques will be useful to understand the circuitry of brain areas of animals with more complex visual systems and brain circuitry such as cat, ferret, and non-human primates."
"9108854","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         There is a well-established relationship between commonly occurring mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and alcohol use disorders, and poor functional outcomes. However, less is known about long-term functional trajectories among returning Veterans and specific factors that predict who will follow better or worse courses of readjustment. Building upon the successful foundation of our currently RR&D-funded MERIT award, this second submission of our renewal application proposes to continue following the existing carefully-characterized cohort of 300 Veterans who served as part of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) for an additional 2-year period. The sample size will also be expanded to include 500 Veterans. The Specific Aims are to identify clinically relevant, modifiable psychosocial factors that: 1) prospectively predict improvements in long-term functioning and community reintegration over time; (2) predict membership in latent class trajectories of functioning; and (3) predict transitions between classes of functional trajectories. Veterans will complete state-of-the-art diagnostic interviews and self-report questionnaires at baseline and 24-months. Follow-up questionnaires will be mailed at 6-, 12-, and 18-months. Multiple domains of functioning will be evaluated, including occupational, family, social, and physical functioning, as well as community reintegration. The long-term objective of this programmatic line of research is to improve functional outcomes and quality of life of returning OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. In keeping with the VHA's goal of operationalizing principles of recovery and rehabilitation in treatment planning, this research wil provide a platform of empirical data to help guide refinement and further development of meaningful treatment programs to assist OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with optimal post-war readjustment over time. Upon completing the study, data from this project will inform allocation of VA resources and targets for clinical interventions that have the highest probability of ensuring that Veterans recover following deployments to warzones."
"9293862","PROJECT SUMMARY This research program aims to elucidate the role of the ipsilateral hemisphere in motor control, entailing parallel studies of upper limb movement in monkey and human. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders by recording from humans and monkeys at different spatial levels of functional neural organization. Previous work from our group has demonstrated that distributed activity in primate motor areas is reliably correlated with ipsilateral upper limb kinematics in monkey and human. This information can be decoded by applying linear methods to neural signals at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, and can be successfully incorporated into a closed-loop BMI system. However, the functional contribution of ipsilateral motor cortex to limb movement remains unclear. Is ipsilateral control limited to proximal muscles or are these signals also relevant for the control of distal muscles? How do ipsilateral representations change in different task contexts, especially when considering contexts in which the two hands are either used independently or in a coordinated manner? This research program will address these fundamental questions. We outline four key hypotheses: H1) Activity in motor cortex provides additional control signals for ipsilateral movements, independent of the activity dedicated to contralateral movements. H2) Movements of one limb transcallosally activate homologous circuits in the ipsilateral motor cortex, activity that might facilitate mirror-symmetric movement or provide a mechanism for generalized motor learning. H3) Activity in ipsilateral motor cortex reflects the simultaneous, bilateral preparation of unimanual movements. H4) Ipsilateral motor activity is related to the control of the contralateral hand, but is modulated by the degree of ipsilateral movements as part of a network required for bimanual coordination. To evaluate these hypotheses, this proposal is structured around two aims, each entailing a series of experiments. The specific aims in both monkey and man are: 1) to characterize the role of ipsilateral motor cortex during unimanual movement and 2) to characterize the role of ipsilateral motor cortex during bimanual movements. Parallel neurophysiological studies will be conducted in human and non-human primates to record and analyze neural activity at different levels of integration. State-of- the-art methods for complementary neural recordings (human electrocorticogram, monkey local field potential and single unit activity) and data analysis will be employed to address the four hypotheses."
"9197812","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9170435","Mechanisms Underlying Contextual Induction of Muscle Thermogenesis While obesity is clearly a major public health concern in the US, it has proven to be stubbornly resistant to prevention and treatment. While investigating mechanisms underlying endogenous amplification of energy expenditure, we identified a pathway in the brain that increases sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity to skeletal muscle, impacting molecular pathways that modulate muscle energy uptake and use. We hypothesize that this increased caloric use promotes leanness by enhancing energy expended during physical activity, increasing muscle thermogenesis where caloric energy is ultimately dissipated as heat. Recently, we discovered that exposure to predator odor (ferret) rapidly and robustly increases muscle thermogenesis in rats. This persists when activity is held constant, and it translates into a significant increase in energy expenditure. Here, we will investigate the neural pathway that is responsible for this effect. Frist, we will demonstrate that predator odor enhances weight loss during energy restriction, and activates muscle thermogenesis even in the absence of interscapular brown adipose tissue or beta-3 adrenergic receptor activation. Second, we hypothesize that activation of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and of steroidogenic factor-1 neurons within the VMH are critical for the ability of predator odor to activate muscle thermogenesis and enhance activity-related energy expenditure. We will use a neural inhibition tool?designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), delivered using a viral vector?to suppress the activity of the VMH in rats, or of steroidogenic factor-1 neurons within the VMH of mice, to demonstrate the role of this cell population in the modulation of muscle metabolism and energy expenditure by predator odor. Lastly, we hypothesize that the SNS is activated by exposure to the predator odor, and that blocking the activity of beta adrenergic receptors will decrease the metabolic response to predator odor. These studies may uncover a novel mechanism for weight loss through enhanced muscle calorie use, and provide opportunities to enhance undergraduate research training in our laboratory."
"9159815","ABSTRACT Advances in technology, bioinformatics, and data science have made it possible to analyze large and complex databases to generate evidence that improves public health and accelerates the development of precision medicine. However, the advent of big data has also raised concerns about privacy and confidentiality. This application is focused on data privacy in vertically partitioned data, a data environment where information about an individual is available in two or more data sources. This type of data structure is common in biomedical research and is expected to grow exponentially as information from the same individual is increasingly collected in multiple sources, such as insurance claims databases, electronic health records, registries, social media, wearables, and mobile devices. Combining multiple databases provides a more complete health profile about the patient and generates more robust evidence. However, concerns about data privacy, confidentiality, and security, and constraints in governance and institutional agreements make it highly challenging or sometimes impossible to physically pool different data sources. We propose to develop an open-source, freely available software tool that will employ a cutting-edge method ? distributed regression ? to analyze vertically partitioned datasets. The method does not require data to be combined physically, but produces statistically equivalent results as if the datasets were linked and pooled centrally at one site. Instead of sharing patient-level information, participating sites will only transfer non-identifiable information matrix (a design matrix used in fitting of statistical models) and other summary-level statistics needed in the statistical modeling process. This approach offers much greater protection for data privacy while allowing one to perform sophisticated statistical analysis. The software tool will be developed, tested, and fine-tuned using both simulated datasets and the real-world data from Optum Labs, which houses one of the largest vertically partitioned datasets in the U.S. with claims and electronic health record data from over 5 million patients. The tool will be made compatible with PopMedNetTM, an open-source data-sharing platform currently used by several large national initiatives such as the NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory Distributed Research Network, the PCORI-funded National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), and the FDA-funded Sentinel program. The tool is therefore highly scalable and can have immediate impacts on real-world big data analysis. The multidisciplinary study team includes researchers who pioneered some of the distributed regression approaches and experts who have extensive experience in multi-center studies. The distributed regression method has great potential to shift the paradigm of multi-center big biomedical research, from transferring of potentially identifiable patient-level data to the sharing of non-identifiable summary-level information. The proposed software tool will be a major step towards real-world application of this state-of-the-art privacy-protecting analytic approach."

"9263474","ABSTRACT Every year there are an estimated 7.9 million children born with a serious birth defect and 3.3 million of these are children under five years of age who die from factors related to their birth defect. Comprehensive, reliable data on birth defects are not available for most developing countries. In many resource-poor settings, the baseline prevalence of birth defects is not known and systematic monitoring for birth defects is difficult or non- existent. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) in pregnancy can maximally reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV, and therefore it is recommended that all pregnant women with HIV receive effective ART regimens to prevent the transmission of HIV to their infants. However, there have been concerns about the possibility of women on ART at conception or during the first trimester having an increased risk of delivering an infant with a birth defect. The goal of this proposal is to establish a birth defect hospital based surveillance program in Kampala, Uganda and to determine the prevalence of major external birth defects and association of maternal risk factors including antiretroviral therapy to these defects. Four hospitals in Kampala, Uganda will be included in the surveillance system with approximately 48,000 deliveries per year. Informative births (live and stillborn) regardless of gestational age that are born at the four hospitals will be included in the surveillance project for a duration of five years. Informative births are those in which the newborn is formed well enough to ascertain whether or not there is a birth defect. Each newborn will be examined as soon as possible after birth. Infant measurements (weight, head circumference and length) will be obtained and all newborns will be examined for major external birth defects by trained midwives. Newborns with major external birth defects will be photographed after obtaining consent and the photographs will be used to classify the diagnosis. As needed, the photos and verbatim descriptions will be sent to birth defect experts for confirmation of diagnoses and for coding of the birth defect using ICD-10 disease classification criteria. Demographic information, HIV status and obstetric information (parity status, previous live and still births, presence of physical defects of births of previous children) will be collected for all mothers. Every mother of an infant identified with a major external birth defect of interest will be asked to participate in a case-control study. Three controls will be selected for each case matched on hospital of delivery. After consenting, each mother will be asked to respond to questions regarding, types of medications taken during pregnancy including antiretroviral drugs and cotrimoxazole, medical history and more detailed demographic information. The surveillance program will provide crucial current data on the baseline prevalence of birth defects in Uganda while the case-control study will allow examination of the possible effects of antiretroviral treatment on infant outcomes while also screening for other common known causes of birth defects."

In support of this goal, we propose to apply our established, state-of-the-art DNA sequencing and analysis platform to comprehensively identify rare variation influencing susceptibility to common complex diseases corresponding to three disease themes: 1) cardiovascular disease and metabolic risk, 2) autoimmune disease including Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) developmental and degenerative diseases including cleft lip/palate, idiopathic scoliosis and macular degeneration. Where possible, we will leverage emerging methods and technology to advance the state of the field and achieve our program goals. Our approach extends the discovery power of low-cost whole genome sequencing (WGS) with innovative laboratory and computational techniques to comprehensively interrogate the full spectrum of human genome variation. We developed these studies with substantial input from expert collaborators whose continued involvement and disease-specific expertise will be critical for success. Ultimately, the diversity of our proposed projects - in ters of disease phenotypes, sample ancestries, and study designs - will provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of common disease and the extent to which it is shared across world populations."
"9252661","ABSTRACT In the US and other developed countries, increased life expectancy has led to increases in aging-related bladder dysfunction and associated lower urinary tract symptoms. Aging and diabetes, as well as many neurological conditions, can result in underactive bladder (UAB), which can cause inefficient voiding, discomfort, and psychological distress, as well as serious complications such as urinary tract infections. In severe cases, UAB can cause loss of voluntary urination and require intermittent bladder catheterization, which is associated with increased incidence of health problems, predominately repeated urinary tract infections, sepsis, urethral trauma and hospitalization. Therefore, a short-acting, effective, and safe product that induces ?on demand? voiding would provide a paradigm shift in the management of UAB and could reduce or eliminate the need for intermittent catheterization. Dignify Therapeutics is developing a novel drug treatment to provide an ?on-demand, rapid-onset, short- duration, drug-induced, voiding therapy? for those who cannot void voluntarily. When administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (sc) to rats, dogs, and minipigs, the neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2R) agonist DTI-100 rapidly induces bladder voiding. However, IV injection is impractical for the multiple daily dosing required by individuals with UAB. Therefore, Dignify is developing sublingual, intranasal, and subcutaneous formulations of our lead development candidate, DTI-100, and find that the onsets (about 2 min) and durations (about 10 min) of action, while within the target range of our clinical product profile, would be even more convenient to use if onset time were further reduced (i.e., 30 seconds). Similarly, a reduction in the duration of action (i.e., 3 minutes) would reduce any residual sensations of urgency or other possible side effects. In addition, since DTI-100 has not yet been tested in man and contains unnatural amino acids, Dignify will also examine compounds that contain only natural amino acids, in case any unexpected safety issues appear during clinical study of DTI-100. In Specific Aim 1, eleven strategically selected structural analogs of DTI-100 will be synthesized. Subsequently, their physicochemical properties, as well their NK2R affinity and selectivity, will be screened using in vitro techniques. In Specific Aim 2, the in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles of the 8 most attractive compounds will be screened using a ?cassette? approach. In Specific Aim 3, the 2 most attractive candidates will be tested for efficacy in producing bladder contractions. Successful completion of this project will identify a 2nd generation NK2R agonist with improved PK properties, and presumably better efficacy and tolerability."

We have discovered that EZH2 overexpression in breast carcinomas is associated with ER negative (ER-) status, and is an independent biomarker of poor survival. While the oncogenic role of EZH2 in breast and other malignancies has been established, the mechanisms are far from clear. EZH2 is the histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), responsible for epigenetic silencing. However, recent studies show that in invasive carcinomas with poor outcome, high EZH2 is associated with low H3K27me3, suggesting that in a subset of aggressive tumors, EZH2 functions through non-canonical H3K27me3-independent mechanisms. In the previous cycle, we have reported one such mechanism by which EZH2 activates NOTCH1. We have now discovered a new mechanism by which p38?-mediated phosphorylation of EZH2 at T367 leads to EZH2 cytoplasmic localization to promote migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Using breast cancer tissues, our new preliminary data show that cytoplasmic pEZH2 T367 is significantly upregulated in distant metastasis compared to their matched primary tumors, and that primary tumors with high pEZH2 T367 metastasize earlier than those with low pEZH2. Previous studies have identified EZH2 in the cytoplasm, but the significance to human cancer was unknown. Further, p38? has been reported to phosphorylate EZH2 at T367 in muscle stem cells, but this event has never been linked to cytoplasmic EZH2 or with cancer. Our central hypothesis is that phosphorylated EZH2 at T367 promotes biologically aggressive breast cancer by localizing to the cytoplasm to enhance tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis through H3K27me3-independent methyltransferase activity. We propose four independent hypothesis-driven aims. AIM 1: To investigate the consequences of inducible mammary- specific EZH2 overexpression on breast cancer progression, and the in vivo relevance of EZH2 non- canonical mechanisms. AIM 2: To elucidate the effect of pEZH2 T367 on neoplastic functions in vivo and in vitro. AIM 3: To investigate the molecular mechanism of pEZH2 T367-mediated breast cancer progression. AIM 4: To evaluate the translational impact of EZH2 non-canonical pathways in human breast tissue samples. We have developed critical reagents including an anti-pEZH2(T367) antibody, EZH2 T367A and T367D mutants (phospho-OFF and phospho-ON, respectively), characterized unique cohorts of human breast cancer tissues (n=500) with well-annotated clinical information and over 10 years of follow-up, and have generated new critical preliminary data. Our innovative studies have the potential to discover novel biomarkers and lead to mechanism-based therapies against breast cancer with EZH2 non-canonical pathway activation."
"9227547","PROJECT SUMMARY  Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumor. Although many of these tumors are benign, presenting as WHO grade I lesions that can be cured with the standard therapeutic interventions of surgical resection and radiation therapy, recurrence is nevertheless relatively common. After failure of frontline treatment, there is unfortunately no effective therapy to offer patients who have progressive recurrent meningioma, and securing durable, long-term disease control in this setting has been challenging. New therapeutic approaches are needed for these cases.  Modern genomic technologies have allowed for broad characterization of somatic gene mutations found in tumor cells in many different cancers. Recent work (by our team and others) in large cohorts consisting primarily of WHO grade I and untreated meningiomas has identified SMO, AKT1, KLF4, BAP1, TRAF7 and TERT promoter mutations in specific subsets of these tumors, in addition to the well-established NF2 inactivation that is characteristic of this neoplasm. To further characterize the clinical scenarios where we can derive maximal clinical benefit with therapeutic targeting of these alterations, we have assembled a large cohort of meningioma patients, which unlike prior discovery cohorts, are considerably enriched for specimens derived from recurrent, post-treatment and WHO grade-progressive tumors.  Our proposed genomic analyses will therefore focus on understanding the molecular alterations across the clinical spectrum of this disease, and more importantly, have the potential to identify the genetic factors that drive meningiomas to relapse or undergo malignant transformation, targets which could be prioritized to maximize clinical impact. Thus, the successful execution of this work will provide important information to facilitate the design and interpretation of ongoing clinical trials for recurrent progressive meningioma."
"9224720","Despite dramatic gains in women?s educational attainment globally, the pace of decline in fertility and child marriage is slower than expected in some countries, raising the question: Under which conditions is women?s education most likely to translate into delayed marriage and lower fertility? A voluminous literature exists on the links between grade attainment and reproductive behavior in the developing world. In contrast, much less is known about the effect of academic skills, both the absolute level and the change in the level, on the timing of marriage and childbearing, in part because researchers have had to rely on cross-sectional data where skill level ? typically literacy ? is measured after the outcomes of interest and grade attainment is used as a proxy for skill level. Further, there appears to be no research in low-income settings on the effect of early marriage and pregnancy on the retention or loss of academic skills. Understanding the bidirectional relationship between academic skills and reproductive behavior, particularly for adolescent girls in low-income settings, who may experience rapid transitions from student to adult roles, will inform more effective interventions both to improve adolescent and adult literacy and numeracy, and to delay marriage and prevent adolescent pregnancy. Using recently collected longitudinal datasets from three low-income settings?Malawi (N=1337), Zambia (N=5241), and Bangladesh (11617), the latter two of which include cluster-randomized controlled trials, the proposed study will contribute to our understanding of the links between academic skills and reproductive behavior among adolescent girls by addressing several key issues: 1) how academic skill levels change during adolescence and factors that contribute to gain or loss; 2) whether there is a minimum level of grade attainment that protects against skill loss; 3) the extent to which skill level, and change in that level, affects the timing of the first reproductive event; 4) the extent to which early marriage and childbearing contribute to loss of academic skills; and 5) the conditions and interventions that promote skill acquisition and retention among vulnerable adolescents. While it is rare to have longitudinal data on skill level combined with data on the timing of marriage and childbearing, it is even rarer to have such data in multiple settings. The analytic sample will be limited to those girls who were enrolled in school and had not yet experienced a first reproductive event (marriage or pregnancy) at baseline. In addition to taking advantage of the cluster-randomized controlled trials embedded in AGEP and BALIKA, we will use instrumental variable analysis and fixed effects models to minimize potential biases in our results due to endogeneity. The proposed study will greatly expand the knowledge base on the causes and consequences of learning retention in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, two regions where, despite increasing access to schooling, large numbers of adolescents lack basic skills needed to lead productive and healthy lives."
"9203664","Hispanic immigrants bear a disproportionate burden of HIV infection in the US. Along with disproportionate rates of HIV infection, Hispanic immigrants are affected by three important drivers of the US HIV epidemic: disordered alcohol and drug use, intimate partner violence, and reduced rates of HIV testing. Importantly, each of these drivers of HIV infection is or has been legally regulated. Findings from a preliminary study suggest that immigration-related laws, Hispanic immigrants' beliefs about the immigration ramifications of engaging in HIV health-seeking behaviors, and immigrants' concerns about the bounds of immigration authority may deter or prevent them from utilizing important health care services and resources. To our knowledge there has never been a direct empirical study of the influence of immigration-related laws and legal concerns on Hispanic immigrants' sensitive HIV-related health-seeking behaviors. The proposed study will address this knowledge gap. Law and policy scans, key informant interviews, and structured focus groups with Hispanic immigrants living in 4 US metropolitan areas with diverse immigration law and enforcement environments will be conducted to explore immigrants' experiences with legal barriers and to identify the immigration-related concerns, beliefs, and misconceptions that influence their service utilization. Using the information gained from these activities, we will develop, refine, and psychometrically evaluate a novel measure of immigration-related concerns about health-seeking behaviors. The resulting Immigration Law Concerns measure will be administered to a large cross-section of Hispanic immigrants. Quantitative analyses of the survey data will identify the immigration law-related beliefs and concerns of our Hispanic immigrant sample, and to determine whether these concerns significantly influence their utilization of, or willingness to utilize alcohol or drug dependence, IPV, and HIV testing services. Associations between immigration environments, legal barriers to healthcare utilization, and resident immigrants' immigration concerns about utilizing services will also be explored. Identifying the nature of Hispanic immigrants' concerns about seeking help for key drivers of HIV infection and the barriers erected by immigration laws and policies will provide important evidence for intervention??at individual-, community-, and structural-levels??to reduce disproportionate rates of HIV infection among Hispanic immigrants and to shape laws and policies that are consistent with our National HIV Prevention Strategy."
"9073487","Project 5  Project Summary Abstract   The goal of this research program is to determine the effects of the EBV oncoproteins, latent  membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and latent membrane 2 (LMP2) on the cellular proteome. Both LMP1 and LMP2  interact with ubiquitin ligases and likely modulate both the levels and location of cellular proteins. This  proposal is based on the hypothesis that critical biologic properties of these two viral oncogenes are based on  their effects on the cellular proteome. The proposed experiments will primarily focus on two specific biologic  effects of LMP1 and LMP2A. We have previously shown that LMP1 affects the content of cellular exosomes  which are internalized and activate growth stimulating signaling pathways in recipient cells. The contribution of  the specific LMP1-interacting ubiquitin ligases to this process will be determined using LMP1 mutants and  inhibition of the interacting ligases. The effects of LMP1 and specific mutants within its signaling domains on  exosome quantity and composition will be determined using mass spectrometry. The requirement for proteins  that we have identified as increased by LMP1 will be assessed using shRNAs or dominant negative forms to  inhibit their expression or function and the protein composition of the LMP1-modulated exosomes will be  determined. The effects on the biologic properties of the exosomes produced by the LMP1 mutants or in the  absence of specific cellular proteins will be identified. LMP2A also affects cell growth and contributes to cell  survival. In epithelial cell lines, LMP2 inhibits differentiation, increases migration, and can induce anchorage  independence. During this last funding period we have determined that in transgenic mice, LMP2 enhances  growth promotion by LMP1 resulting in increased development of carcinomas. Three major signaling motifs  have been identified within LMP2 that interact with src family kinases, syk family kinases, and ubiquitin ligases.  We have recently shown that the apoptosis induced by anchorage loss (anoikis) is inhibited by LMP2A. This  inhibition was dependent on the induction of autophagy and required the ubiquitin ligase binding domain. We  have also determined that LMP2 affects the expression levels of multiple proteins involved in vesicle transport.  The contribution of specific LMP2 domains on cellular protein expression and localization will be determined  using mass spectrometry of vesicular fractions and immunofluorescent staining. The requirement for induction  of autophagy in LMP2-mediated growth effects will be determined."
"9190134","The Mayo Glioblastoma (GBM) Xenograft National Resource will provide users with robust animal models, with corresponding phenotypic and molecular characterizations, that recapitulate key molecular and histologic phenotypes of human GBM tumors from a panel of 79 patient-derived xenografts (PDX). These tumor models were created at the Mayo Clinic by implanting surgical tissue directly into immunocompromised mice and then serially passaging these tumors in mice. The PDX models are highly representative of human GBM tumors and preserve the complex molecular features of the human tumors they were derived from. These highly translational and relevant models have been used widely in neuro-oncology research; the Mayo GBM PDXs are used in over 100 peer-reviewed manuscripts and are key reagents in 37 NIH-funded grants (including 16 NINDS-funded grants). As a complement to the rich multi-omic data sets available on human tumor samples (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas), the goal of this R24 is to provide a similar level of molecular characterization across our GBM PDX models and make the data freely-available for Users. Availability of comprehensive multi-omic data for this large PDX panel is critically important to allow Users to readily identify the most relevant tumor model(s) for use in their specific research projects. Towards this goal, the RNAseq, total- and phospho-proteomics studies proposed in this study (Aim 1) will be combined with our whole-exome sequencing and whole methylome studies to provide a broad molecular characterization across the PDX panel. These datasets will be integrated using systems biology approaches to identify critically deregulated signaling networks, which will help Users with limited bioinformatics experience interpret the multi-omic PDX characterizations (Aim 2). We will host all of the PDX molecular and phenotypic characterizations using the open-source cBioPortal software (used to host The Cancer Genome Atlas data at MSKCC) to provide a user-friendly interface to a powerful database with robust integrative multi-omic search capabilities (Aim 3). In parallel, the Mayo GBM Xenograft National Resource will develop an archive of early-passage tumor analytes (DNA, RNA, and protein extracts) and frozen or cryopreserved tumor samples for distribution to Users (Aim 4). In this way, the Aims planned for this proposed National Resource will significantly enhance the availability of highly characterized GBM PDX models for use in basic and translational research across the neuro-oncology community."
"8998268","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For nearly 20 years, our Program has been at the leading edge of discoveries addressing the consequences of neuroinflammation triggered by neuronal stresses arising from genetic factors (mutation and other alleles), traumatic brain injury, epileptiform activity, corruption of angiotensin, insulin/IGF1 and autophagy systems, and normal aging. The resulting knowledge of key early events and predisposing factors in neuropathogenesis, together with new collaborative opportunities, now position this Program to turn the page and embark on novel translational studies. We have documented neuroinflammation-particularly elevation of interleukin 1 (IL-1) - to be a principal driver of overexpression of pathology-related proteins. For example, in humans with Down's syndrome, epilepsy, HIV infection, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's, as well as in rodent models and neural cultures, neuronal stress leads to overexpression of APP and sAPP for induction of glial activation and IL-1. Production of A? and other proteins that are prone to aggregation (e.g., ?-synuclein and hyperphosphorylated tau) follow suit. These proteins disrupt or overwhelm the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) leading to proteinopathy that includes aggregation of motor proteins and elements of the UPS. In Project 3, we have begun to characterize this proteinopathy through identification of a novel protein that contributes critically to age-related aggregation of components of the UPS in A?-transgenic nematodes (C. elegans), a phenomenon eradicated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other, and novel drugs. This is lent additional relevance by the Project-1 discovery that ?-synuclein, hyperphosphorylated tau, and Parkin (the E3 ubiquitin ligase for these two proteins) co-aggregate in AD and PD. Insulin resistance and related effects on metabolism, uncovered in Project 2, are likely related to such proteinopathies and their inflammatory sequelae. We propose that these three elements-neuroinflammation, proteinopathy, and insulin resistance-cause and/or reinforce one another to create neurodegeneration that is characterized by glial activation, IL-1 overexpression, and protein aggregates with overlapping constituents regardless of the specific disease classification. A corollary is that common targets can be identified leadin to development of therapeutic drugs to reduce aggregation of disease-related proteins and proteinopathy in neurological diseases. The proposed studies are constructed to identify, explore, and functionally characterize specific pathways responsible for pathologic signatures that are either unique to one disease or are common to several age-related neurological diseases. Such delineation may identify tractable processes amenable to specific drug interventions and suggest lifestyle/environmental conditions that foster successful aging. The addition of a new drug-discovery effort (Core D) empowers us to test the over-riding hypothesis while simultaneously identifying lead compounds of therapeutic potential. Thus, the arc of this Program is now directed toward effective therapies, based on foundations laid through mechanistic research proposed here and conducted throughout the productive history of this Program."
"9146677","PROJECT 1: Pathways and mechanisms repressing D4Z4 repeats Abstract FSHD is caused by derepression of the DUX4 retrogene in skeletal muscle, either by contraction induced chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 repeat array (FSHD1), or by mutations in the chromatin modifier SMCHD1 or yet unidentified chromatin modifiers (FSHD2). These facts lead to the major hypothesis that FSHD is caused by incomplete repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing of DUX4 in somatic cells and that targeting the D4Z4 chromatin structure is a rational therapy for FSHD. Therefore, the broad and long term goal is to identify the components and mechanisms of repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing at D4Z4 and to determine whether they function in convergent pathways that can be used to develop therapies that enhance epigenetic repression of D4Z4. The specific goal is to identify modulators of D4Z4 chromatin structure and DUX4 expression by a genetics approach. This will be accomplished by: Aim 1 identify additional DNMT3B mutations that cause FSHD2 and test the hypothesis that DNMT3B mutations with distinct clinical phenotypes have distinct epigenetic consequences at the D4Z4 repeat; Aim 2 identify novel genetic variants in chromatin modifiers that affect the D4Z4 chromatin structure in somatic cells and cause FSHD or act as a disease modifier; and Aim 3, establish the genome wide epigenetic and transcriptional consequences of mutations in FSHD2 genes and to identify enhancers repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing at D4Z4 as novel targets for therapy. Together, these aims will identify additional modifiers of D4Z4 repression and their epigenetic activity, and establish which modifiers of D4Z4 chromatin structure can be targeted for FSHD therapy. The significance of these studies is that identifying the components and mechanisms of repeat-mediated epigenetic silencing of DUX4 will facilitate the development of new drug therapies in FSHD"
"9173645","Genetic studies identify regions of the human genome associated with disease, and containing large numbers of potentially causative variants. Prioritizing these variants for follow-up functional studies is one of the foremost issues in genetic research today, but existing datasets lack the precision that is needed. We propose to use a new cost-effective genome assembly method in the sequencing of 150 additional placental mammals, and then to produce a comprehensive annotation resource for the human genome as well as for primates, rodents, and dogs. This will increase the understanding of the function and evolution of the human genome and enable the prioritization mutations that diseases and biological functions that have emerged over a variety of time-scales.  We will select 150 placental mammals for sequencing in collaboration with the San Diego Zoo. In combination with the ~50 already existing high quality placental mammalian assemblies, we aim to achieve one sequenced placental mammal per family. We will use the new assembly method: DISCOVAR de novo, which allows the production of a good quality novel genome assembly using only a single sequencing library type. We will thus reduce the sequencing costs of new genome assemblies ten-fold and will only require small amounts of normal-quality DNA, solving two of the major problems for projects of this nature. We will align our new 150 placental mammalian assemblies, along with the 50 already existing assemblies together, and will then use this to annotate many protein-coding and non-coding features of the human genome, along with a conservation (similarity) score. We will perform a similar analysis aligning all primate assemblies to the human genome, all rodent assemblies to the mouse genome and all Laurasiatheria assemblies to the dog genome. In addition, we will analyse large-scale disease genetics datasets to prioritize causative variants, determine rates of transcription factor binding site turnover and examine convergent evolution and genotype-phenotype correlation across placental mammals.  Overall, this work will yield important new resources for the genomics community: a wealth of new mammalian genomes and conservation tracks and analysis to aid the discovery of evolutionarily important and disease-causing variants. Collaborators include Dr. Ryder, an expert in phylogeny and conservation, the Broad Institute and SciLifeLab Genomics Platforms, experts in sequencing, Dr. Haussler, leader of the UCSC Genome Browser, and a consortium of analysts: Drs. Bejerano, Marques-Bonet, Lewin, Taipale, and Ponting, all of whom are outstanding computational biologists in the field of comparative genomics."
"9256364","Project Summary Neonatal jaundice, or hyperbilirubinemia, is an almost ubiquitous condition in newborn infants. In very rare circumstances, if an infant with signficant hyperbilirubinemia is undetected, kernicterus, a devastating and permanent neurologic condition, can develop. Still rare, but much more frequently, a neonate with significant jaundice is not identified until the bilirubin level is very high, necessitating complicated and expensive care to prevent bilirubin encephalopathy. Although the identification of infants with moderate hyperbilirubinemia, at levels that are easily treatable, is a central focus of neonatal care in the US, bilirubin levels typically peak after most neonates are discharged from the newborn nursery. There is currently a lack of accurate, inexpensive and widely available methodologies to screen discharged infants for jaundice, leaving a notable void in the overall system of care designed to prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia. Our group has developed a non- invasive technology, called BiliCam, to measure bilirubin in newborn infants. The technology is based on the analysis of digital images of newborn skin that are obtained with a smartphone app that we have developed. Based on this analysis a bilirubin estimate is calculated and displayed on the smartphone. A study to collect data do develop and finalize the algorithm converting data from the images into an estimate bilirubin level is currently in progress. To date, a racially and ethnically diverse sample of over 500 newborn infants from 7 sites across the United States have been enrolled in this study. The results are very promising; BiliCam provides estimates of bilirubin that are similar in accuracy to those achieved with a transcutaneous bilirubinometer, the predicate device. Data collection for the study will conclude in late 2016 and the algorithm will be finalized. In order to commercialize the technology, the developers have formed a private company, BiliCam, LLC. In a presubmission meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the studies needed to be completed to support a 510(k) submission for initial clearance for Bilicam were described. The overall goal of the proposed project is to conduct these studies needed for obtaining FDA clearance. First, a clinical validation study will be conducted using BiliCam to estimate bilirubin levels in a diverse sample of > 200 newborns from three sites. The estimated bilirubin levels will be compared to the total serum bilirubin (TSB) level, the gold standard for clinical decision making, in the newborns. Second, the reproducibility of BiliCam results will be assessed using 10 different smartphones with the app installed to obtain sets of images from 3 phantoms representing various bilirubin levels; over 300 readings will be obtained. Finally, the usability of the BiliCam app will be assessed in 45 healthcare professionals who are the intended users for the initial clearances for the technology. A two-year study period is planned. !"

"9306455","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There remains a wide gap in the US between the care children should receive and the care they do receive. The federal Pediatric Quality Measures Program (PQMP) was created to develop quality measures for diverse settings and purposes. Through the PQMP, we received funding to establish the Center of Excellence for Quality Measurement (CEPQM) to develop and test child quality measures. Working with multiple states and stakeholders, we developed measures in areas of critical importance to payers, providers, and families. For the PQMP's current dissemination and implementation stage, our specific aims are to convene a multidisciplinary partnership team and collaborate with Massachusetts (MA) and New York (NY) to: (A) field test two measure sets to ensure validity, feasibility, and usability for states, health plans, and hospitals, and further develop strategies to streamline data collection and measure reporting; and (B) use performance data to define quality improvement (QI) goals, assess intervention effects, and drive state-level improvement. We have selected two of our measure sets: (1) pediatric 30-day readmissions, comprising two measures, All-Condition Readmissions and Lower Respiratory Infection Readmissions, and (2) family experience of pediatric inpatient care, comprising the 18 measures included in the Child Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (Child HCAHPS) Survey. Both measure sets are harmonized with the corresponding adult measures used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other payers, and many US hospitals. Both readmission measures and Child HCAHPS have been endorsed by the National Quality Forum. In addition, All-Condition Readmissions and Child HCAHPS were prioritized by the Measure Applications Partnership in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for inclusion in the CMS Child Core Set. Our multidisciplinary partnership includes academic researchers; representatives from MA and NY health departments, External Quality Review Organizations, health plans, and hospitals; and QI experts from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and National Improvement Partnership Network. We will also enhance our measures; for instance, we will test improving the readmissions case-mix model through including electronic health record data, and administering Child HCAHPS on day of discharge to increase participation. Our QI strategies will be grounded in the theory and practice of implementation science and will include analysis of contextual factors that affect current performance, identification of key drivers of improvement, development of intermediate process measures, and local tests of change. Reducing preventable readmissions and improving family experience of inpatient care are among the highest priorities for our health system. Through this project, we aim not only to advance knowledge about how to apply measures effectively, but also to produce strategies and tools that can be applied to implementation and care improvement in many measure domains and across the entire country."
"9147590","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread recognition of pervasive patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system, research to develop feasible, scalable solutions has lagged, particularly in the ambulatory setting. The need for new approaches to improve safety is especially pressing in the care of ambulatory patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, as reports of preventable adverse events among this category of drugs have increased. To date, no studies have carefully defined the epidemiology of these safety risks. The proposed Advancing Safety Process Innovation Using Registries (ASPIRE) project will use advanced electronic health record (EHR) data analytics to define the magnitude of ambulatory patient safety errors and adverse events for patients receiving high risk medications (Aim 1). We will also characterize disparities in these risks across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and medical complexity. Three categories of patient safety processes will be examined: 1) preventive practices that reduce adverse medication events, 2) safety monitoring for patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, and 3) management of abnormal results from medication toxicity monitoring. These findings will be used to inform the development of eMeasures, a new approach to quality measurement that uses automatically extracted EHR information to give clinicians and health systems information regarding specific patient safety problems (Aim 2). We will use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model (QDM), Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) and other structured coded terminologies to develop, specify and test system-wide prototype eMeasures. HIT-solutions such as eMeasures that can be applied across EHR data repositories serve as a foundation for a continuous learning health care system, as envisioned by the Institute of Medicine. The work proposed here builds the groundwork for further testing and nationwide dissemination of eMeasures to monitor and improve safety for those using high-risk medications in the ambulatory setting."
"9216367","Rationale: Dementia is a growing problem in the US and worldwide. The lack of effective treatment or preventive strategies for Alzheimer?s Disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, has led to an increasing mortality rate and soaring medical costs. Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is also highly prevalent in older adults, and new evidence suggests it may be associated with AD and its precursor, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but prospective validation is lacking. We propose to prospectively study the role of ICAD and its progression in the development of cognitive decline, MCI and dementia, in particular AD. Aims: We will determine if ICAD presence and measures by MRI, including its progression and a risk index based on baseline ICAD features, lead to cognitive decline, incident MCI and incident dementia. We will determine if ICAD adds to the predictive value of regional brain volume loss, a known predictor of AD. Finally, we will establish risk factors and plaque features that predict progression of ICAD. Design/Methods: We will conduct an ancillary study to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, an NIH-funded cardiovascular cohort that began with about 16,000 participants, aged 45-64, who have been followed since 1987. The ARIC Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS), conducted at the most recent ARIC visit in 2011-2013, acquired brain MRIs and cognitive evaluations to study cross-sectional associations of vascular risk factors and MRI brain changes with MCI and dementia. MRI also identified and measured stenosis and, for the first time, ICAD using a novel vessel wall imaging technique. This technique detects atherosclerotic plaques even if they do not result in stenosis and may be a better measure of atherosclerotic disease burden. We plan to acquire a repeat brain MRI in 1,000 participants at the next NIH-funded ARIC visit that begins in 2016 after a 5-8 year interval to measure ICAD progression, brain volume loss, and small vessel disease (SVD), another cause of blood flow impairment associated with AD. Repeat cognitive evaluations are also planned. We expect 335 and 266 incident cases of MCI and dementia, respectively, by the start of this exam. We will then evaluate the association of ICAD at baseline with incident cognitive outcomes. The MRI will allow us to make a specific diagnosis of AD (or AD-type in MCI), permitting analysis of its risk factors. In addition, we will use follow-up MRI data to measure changes in luminal stenosis and vessel wall thickness to identify ICAD progression. We will account for SVD and vascular risk factors when analyzing associations with ICAD. It is worth noting that large infarcts are an uncommon cause of dementia and not the primary focus of this study. Implications: Through our proposed study we will establish the role of ICAD in the development and progression of MCI and dementia, in particular AD. This will be the first study characterizing the natural history of ICAD progression and its ability to predict cognitive outcomes. This information could lead to preventive strategies and risk stratification for treatment protocols in an otherwise currently untreatable disease."
"9301193","PROJECT SUMMARY Gastrointestinal (GI) motility and defecation are absolute prerequisites for nutrient absorption, fecal elimination and overall health. Normal GI motility, vascular perfusion, and intestinal inflammation are coordinated by vast numbers of neurons that reside within ganglia of the enteric nervous system (ENS) intrinsic to the gut wall. While recent work has identified diverse genes that direct the initial development of progenitor cells that give rise to enteric neurons in the wall of the intestine, we know very little about the genes that are expressed in adult enteric neurons. Consequently we are unable to determine whether efforts to generate enteric neurons produce the normal complement of cell types. Moreover we do not fully understand how distinct types of neurons contribute to overall coordination of intestinal motility because the use of common immunohistochemical markers alone does not distinguish functionally distinct subtypes. As a result, our abilities to target and functionally manipulate specific types of neurons in the gut are extremely limited. To surpass these limitations, our application proposes to develop a comprehensive, single cell transcriptome map of adult enteric neurons in normal mice in parallel with deep sequencing of enteric ganglia from distinct regions of human intestine so that a global gene expression atlas of human enteric ganglia is obtained. To capture mouse enteric neurons for single cell RNA-Seq we will use a fluorescent transgenic mouse line that we developed for live-cell imaging of enteric neurons. Human enteric ganglia will be collected by laser capture microdissection from adult surgical remnants. Comparison of enteric neuron expression profiles between mouse and human data sets will identify conserved genes that mark distinct neuronal subtypes. To set the stage for relating specific neuronal subtypes in the mouse to GI motility we will concurrently quantify intestinal transit and motility patterns across inbred strains of mice using novel ex vivo motility imaging methods. The resulting atlas of molecular fingerprints for enteric neurons in combination with high resolution motility patterns will provide essential information needed to begin targeted, functional manipulation of GI motility in distinct regions of the intestine."

Fifteen clients have been provided letters of collaboration for  cancer-focused grant proposals, and 6 junior faculty members have been mentored with regard to developing tissue  procurement or analysis aims in grant proposals. The histology component has provided high-quality service at  below-market recharge rates, with short turn-around times for CFCCC members who are mainly pursuing  translational research on human cancer specimens or studying animal models of human cancer. These  features have made our histology services superior to those available from commercial vendors, contributing to  usage growth. ETR services contributed to 58 publications in the previous 5 years, from 36 different CFCCC  Principal Investigators. Interpretive histopathology services have been particularly valuable to investigators  pursuing translational and clinical research projects. In the coming funding period, priorities for growing the  service include updating the IRB and prospective informed consent process for tissue banking, adding  cryostorage space and specimen processing capabilities for bone marrow aspirate collection, and  implementing new data management tools for the intake, inventory, QC/QA, and disbursement of research  tissues."
"9128417","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The UAB Center for the Study of Community Health, a University Wide Interdisciplinary Research Center, has adopted specific aims to (1) provide a University platform for community-based participatory research (CBPR); (2) engage stakeholders via education and service; and (3) pursue research that enhances community health. Long term objectives are to (1) develop CBPR tools and methodologies; and (2) create a unified community engagement portal for the University. The proposed 5-year prevention project advances these aims and addresses HIV/AIDS, a CDC Winnable Battle. HIV/AIDS prevalence is increasing disproportionately in the Deep South. The project focuses on HIV risk and protective behaviors and suboptimal HIV testing uptake identified in prior research. Goals are to: (1) reach at-risk African American emerging adults living in Birmingham-Hoover, AL neighborhoods experiencing the urban health penalty; and (2) offer population- sensitive and specific HIV prevention programs that are appealing, evidence-based, scalable, and sustainable using modern communication channels to engage individuals and contribute to changed social network norms. The project includes an evaluation of intervention efficacy, upon which an evaluation of intervention diffusion to peer networks is built. CITY Health II will evaluate an entertainment education (EE) intervention to promote HIV testing and protective behaviors and reduce risk behaviors using an integrated phone and web platform. A cluster randomized trial will recruit 700 participants using Respondent Driven Sampling to compare the efficacy of (1) established voluntary HIV counseling, testing, and referral (VCTR usual care control) to be offered at baseline and monthly for 3 months until testing is accepted; and (2) usual care plus 12 weeks of Entertainment Education (EE) serial drama episodes that deliver HIV risk reduction and health promotion messages using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. Participants in the intervention condition will use Twitter to invite network members to listen to EE episodes on a study website. Thus, the study includes a controlled evaluation of EE for HIV prevention while also assessing a key dimension of peer-driven intervention effectiveness (uptake) under real world conditions. Follow-up includes 3 monthly IVR assessments and a 6- month interview. Hypotheses are: (1) Adding a social network intervention to VCTR will improve HIV testing uptake and protective behaviors and reduce risk-taking. (2) The network intervention will change individuals' HIV-related outcomes through changes in perceived norms and self-efficacy/outcome expectations. (3) Intervention condition participants with more media experience and larger networks will benefit more from the intervention, and intervention diffusion will depend on the same characteristics. CITY Health II will advance understanding of intervention efficacy and underlying mechanisms and will contribute to the next generation of HIV prevention approaches by combining an established individual-level intervention with a novel social network intervention. The intervention is peer-driven and accessible, with scalability potential."

"9213211","Abstract Background: Evidence suggests coordination of hospital obstetric service across hospitals with graduated service levels, termed regionalization, could improve maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, research related to these outcomes with regionalization focuses on perinatal outcomes, is hindered by lack of linked data sets, and uses proxy measures of hospital service level. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between hospital obstetric service level and maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity as well as resource use for women with high risk of obstetric complications. Specific Aims: 1) Identify associations between delivery hospital level of obstetric service and maternal outcomes for women at high risk of obstetric complications. 2) Identify associations between delivery hospital level of obstetric service and neonatal outcomes for children of women at high risk of obstetrical complications. 3) Identify associations between delivery hospital level of obstetric service and length of stay for women at high risk of obstetrical complications. Significance: This study will provide estimates of the association between graduated levels of obstetric service and both obstetric and neonatal outcomes to inform policy decisions regarding implementation of regionalization of obstetric service. In addition, this study will provide evidence to support clinical decision making regarding transfer of obstetric care for high risk women. Innovation: This study evaluates hospital regionalization using hospital discharge data linked to vital statistics records from birth certificates as well as maternal, fetal, and neonatal death. This innovation allows this study to estimate associations between hospital obstetric service level and maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality both in and out of the hospital, while controlling for obstetric risk factors and neonatal service level. Methodology: This is a retrospective analysis of the Georgia Maternal Child Health Repository Data Base for the years 2009 through 2013. The sample is restricted to women identified as high risk for obstetric complication as measured by a validated maternal comorbidity index. Hospital obstetric service level will be measured using the CDC LoCATe Tool which has been designed to coincide with the recently developed graduated levels of obstetric care. Hierarchical modeling will be used to estimate the odds ratio for maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality as well as maternal and neonatal morbidity at each obstetric service level using hospitals with the highest obstetric level as reference. In addition, the difference in median length of stay for high risk women at hospitals with each obstetric service level will be estimated."
"9152531","PROJECT SUMMARY The primary risk factor for prevalent diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration is aging. Despite an extensive list of age-associated defects, we have a limited view of how aging becomes a major disease determinant. The traditional method in the field is to induce genetic modifications in a model organism before the aging process manifests itself, and to subsequently determine how these alterations affect lifespan. These studies have been instrumental in identifying factors that impact longevity. However, they lack the temporal resolution to distinguish the gene products that directly counteract age-associated damage from those that have indirect effects on lifespan, merely through delaying cell cycle progression, growth and/or development. The key challenge in the aging field is the development of an effective approach that allows identification of the underlying mechanisms of aging and manipulation of identified factors in a controlled manner. Here, I propose an innovative strategy designed to identify genes that directly rescue age-induced dysfunction. My approach is to use the natural system of gametogenesis, which I have shown can naturally reverse cellular aging, as a platform to illuminate the molecular causes of aging and to ultimately develop new strategies to counteract age-induced cellular damage. Gametogenesis is a tightly regulated developmental program whereby a progenitor cell undergoes cell division and differentiation to form haploid gametes; the mature germ cells necessary for the propagation of sexually- reproducing organisms. I discovered that in budding yeast, old cells reset their lifespan and remove age- induced cellular damage upon gametogenesis. Furthermore, I found that the expression of a gametogenesis- specific transcription factor, NDT80, during vegetative growth extends the lifespan of old cells. This finding indicates that aging can be rescued directly, and that the factors necessary for age-reversal during gametogenesis have the ability to function in other cellular contexts. Based on this logic, my lab will identify rejuvenation factors by performing a high-throughput screen, designed to identify anti-aging factors whose expression in old cells cause rescue of cellular aging and life span extension. The subsequent functional characterization of these genes using microfluidics, high-resolution live-cell microscopy and biochemical approaches will delineate their mode of action, thereby allowing us to paint a system-wide view of the underlying principles of aging. In parallel, I propose experiments to unravel the cellular quality-control pathways essential for remodeling of gametes, and the utilization of these pathways to eliminate age-induced cellular damage in somatic cells. Our studies will provide insights into the molecular basis of aging and should stimulate the development of novel strategies to decrease susceptibility to age-associated disease and extend health span."
"9164832","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The rising prevalence of severe obesity in early childhood, especially in underrepresented minorities, is a challenge to the cardio-metabolic health of our youth. Although largely attributed to the environment, heredity plays a significant role in determining adiposity. The influence of these genetic factors is largely undefined in children from underrepresented minorities where the prevalence is the highest. This study seeks to identify the rare genetic variants contributing to severe obesity in a large cohort of children with severe early onset obesity from mixed ethnic groups. The primary goal is to explain the biology of extreme obesity by understanding the effects of genetic variants on physiological attributes leading to extreme obesity. We hypothesize that the burden of genetic variants related to obesity will be higher in children with severe early onset of obesity,  The sample of subjects is selected from children with severe obesity (BMI > 120% of the 95th percentile, equivalent to Class II obesity or higher), documented at an age less than 6 years. We have established a large multi-institutional collaborative cohort including a prospective family study of children attending the clinics at Boston Children?s Hospital that serve large populations of underrepresented minorities, a cohort at Children?s Hospital of Philadelphia using data extraction from the electronic health records and samples from the biorepository and a research cohort from the Columbia University Medical Center. For the prospective family study, children with severe obesity and their first-degree relatives are invited to participate in the study. In the collaborative cohort, we will perform whole exome sequencing in children with extremes of obesity, most rapid trajectory of growth of body mass index and those with family structure favorable for mendelian pattern of inheritance. We will perform targeted sequencing of approximately 80 genes including those causing syndromic and non-syndromic forms of obesity, and those prioritized in the whole exome study in all other samples. We will develop an integrated genetic risk score based on the common and identified rare genetic variants, and correlate it with the longitudinal BMI trajectories and cardio-metabolic consequences extracted from the electronic health records. Additionally, we will perform metabolic phenotyping including energy intake and expenditure, body composition and hormonal response to a standard meal in a subgroup from the extreme tails of the genetic risk scores to understand the differences in physiology leading to severe obesity.  Individuals of different genetic ancestries can have different patterns of genetic variation. It is possible that studying multiple ethnicities may identify new genes. Children with rare variants of large effect, or varying genetic risk scores could help describe differences in physiology uncovering therapeutic targets, or a response to treatment that could eventually influence clinical care. Finally, our study cohort of underrepresented minorities will provide a unique replication/extension cohort for other large-scale genetic studies in children with severe obesity."
"9264705","Abstract Liver fibrosis/cirrhosis is one of the most common outcomes of chronic liver disease. Chronic liver disease is assessed by progressive fibrosis caused by repeated injury due to metabolic dysfunction, alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, or autoimmune disease. If it is left unchecked, liver fibrosis will progress to cirrhosis, an advanced stage of the disease estimated to affect 1?2% of the world?s population. The major clinical consequences of cirrhosis are impaired liver function and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), both of which increase the risk of death. The current gold diagnostic method of biopsy has many limitations such as sampling errors, high inter-observer variability with 33% error rate even for diagnosis of advanced stages of liver fibrosis such as cirrhosis. Currently, there is NO non-invasive way to detect liver fibrosis at an early stage with desired sensitivity and accuracy. There is a major unmet medical need to develop noninvasive imaging methodologies and MRI contrast agents to detect early stage of liver fibrosis and stage the progression of liver fibrosis. The goal of STTR Phase I research is to obtain proof-of-principle evidence to achieve early detection of liver fibrosis with significantly improved sensitivity and selectivity by optimizing and characterizing our designed protein-based contrast agents (ProCAs) with liver preference and disease specificity. Aim 1 is to develop MRI molecular imaging contrast agents for non-invasive detection of liver fibrosis. Aim 2 is to evaluate in vivo imaging capability of liver fibrosis for early stage detection using mouse. Aim 3 is to perform acute toxicity studies."
"9255255","Project Summary Mobility limitations including gait and balance impairments are common in older adults and are a major cause of falls and reduced quality of life. Although laboratory studies show that biofeedback during exercise training can improve motor performance, physical therapists do not have access to an overground gait biofeedback system for their patients.

The system will provide reports that show clinically actionable measures of gait and balance. This 1-year project has two speci?c aims: AIM I. Develop and validate a visual biofeedback system. This aim will be achieved with two milestones: Milestone 1: Develop and validate real-time algorithms to calculate clinically actionable gait metrics including double support time, step time asymmetry, foot clearance, arm swing, pitch angle at heel-strike, and trunk lateral stability during gait. We will validate the new algorithms with a gold-standard Motion Analysis system in 15 older adults with gait impairments. Milestone 2: Develop a user-interface for Mobility Rehab to display real-time and longitudinal gait metrics for therapists and their patients. AIM II. Demonstrate the feasibility of Mobility Rehab for gait training in older adults. This aim will be achieved with two milestones: Milestone 3: Evaluate the immediate e?ects of Mobility Rehab on gait training in adults with gait impairments.

As mandated by RFA AG16001, CGAD will assemble all data (Cores A and B) generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Sequence Project (ADSP) from both the Discovery Phase and the Replication Phase, and all data from non-ADSP sources (Core A) including that generated by grants funded under RFA AG16002. CGAD will; 1) create and support a collaborative network of all CGAD, ADSP, RFA AG16002, and other AD genetics investigators (Core A); 2) harmonize all genetic and phenotype data and fully annotate all variants (Core B); 2) design all harmonization and annotation protocols (Core C, implemented by Core B); 3) design analysis protocols for all data (Core C); 4) implement analyses plans (Core C, except for computationally intensive protocols that will be executed by Core B); 5) broadly distribute primary data, harmonized annotated analysis-ready files, and analyses results including depositing appropriate data into qualified access databases [National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Storage site (NIAGADS) and database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)] (Core B). As mandated by RFA AG16001, all harmonization protocols and analyses plans will be refined in collaboration with all ADSP, RFA AG16002, and other AD genetics investigators. The Overall Component describes in detail the proposed activities and analyses to be executed by the cores. We will analyze Replication Phase data using single and gene-based analyses. Both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs) will be analyzed. We will perform a combined analysis of Replication and Discovery Phase data. We will also perform an Extended Replication Phase using non- ADSP data. We will analyze data from all phases in a pathway network analysis, an interaction analysis, and a polygenic risk score.

"9195482","PROJECT SUMMARY DK70977 retains its focus on gnotobiotic models of the dynamic operations the human gut microbiota, and the development of new experimental designs/tools to analyze how dietary components, specifically different prebiotic polysaccharides added to diets representative of those consumed in the USA, shape microbial community structure/function. It is based on the following advances and leverages a partnership between 2 labs with complementary expertise. (1) Methods for creating clonally arrayed sequenced `personal' culture collections that capture the majority of bacterial taxa present in a human fecal microbiota sample. (2) Finding that culture collections from twins stably discordant for obesity transmit the donor's discordant adiposity phenotypes plus obesity-associated metabolic abnormalities to germfree (GF) mice. Co-housing results in invasion of specific bacterial species from the lean (Ln) community into the guts of cagemates harboring Ob co-twin's culture collection, preventing obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities. Invasion, principally by members of the Bacteroides occurs with a representative USA diet low in saturated fats/high fruits-vegetables diet (LoSF/HiFV) but not with a HiSF/LoFV diet. (3) Methods for performing genome-wide transposon mutagenesis of multiple Bacteroides strains and simultaneously identifying genes/metabolic pathways that confer their fitness in specified diet/community contexts (multi-taxon insertion sequencing, INSeq). (4) Methods for generating GF piglets. We will pursue 2 aims. Aim 1, Perform diet oscillation studies in Ln-colonized mice fed 160 different HiSF/LoFV diets supplemented with 40 different purified plant polysaccharides (PPS) in varying doses, some from the waste-streams of commercial food processing, and identify PPS that produce the greatest increase in abundance of a single targeted Bacteroides (`high selectivity, large effect size lead) or significant increases in the greatest number of targeted Bacteroides (`broad range, significant effect size lead). Followup mechanistic studies using (i) these leads, fed monotonously at different doses, and in diet oscillations of different periodicity, plus (ii) multi-taxon INSeq, microbial RNA-Seq, new methods for multiplex quantitative proteomics, and metabolomics, are intended to provide new definitions/insights about niche, syntrophic partnerships, foodwebs, competitiveness, and their impact on community/host metabolism. Leads will also be tested with the Ob collection supplemented with Bacteroides invaders. Aim 2, Application of these methods to gnotobiotic piglets, colonized with these defined communities, fed HiSF/LoFV ± PPS leads and gavaged with `artificial microscopic nutrient platforms' consisting of fluorescently-labeled paramagnetic beads coated with different PPS, that can be retrieved from gut samples by FACS, should provide an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal detail of how community structure and function varies along the length of the gut, how nutrient sharing relationships are established and operate in different PPS and community contexts and establish the translatability of data obtained from gnotobiotic mice to this second more human-like model."
"9157994","Project Summary/Abstract Many outcome predictors used in precision medicine are based upon experience with populations of previous patients who are similar in important ways. However, standard Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) seldom support real-time population queries and therefore cannot administer precision medicine as part of their integrated decision support for clinicians. Furthermore, the data upon which many precision medicine algorithms operate is not available in standard EMRs because it comes from advanced genomics, imaging analytics, and other data modalities which fall outside of the data domains of standard EHR platforms. We propose developing Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2), a well- established, open source, integrated, big data analytic platform that is currently used at over 140 hospitals and medical centers, to study phenotype/genotype comparisons and incorporate it into the EHR using small, connected applications named Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART). We will take the Partners HealthCare genomics platform, GeneInsight, and integrate its data into our Epic EHR workflow using i2b2. We will then test specific decision support algorithms for inherited cardiac diseases. The resulting software will be open source and allow integration of genomics-based, big data decision support algorithms broadly into EHRs. We will also use these same data to provide decision support to laboratory professionals who classify variants relative to their clinical effects. Standard methods of representing these data will be used to make the algorithms transportable and universally applicable. The Decision Support Apps that are created will be evaluated not only for their potential impact upon clinical care, but also for their durability and adaptability to different healthcare environments.  "
"9264121","Project summary  Acute pancreatitis is among the most common gastrointestinal causes for hospitalization in the U.S. Roughly one in five patients with acute pancreatitis will have recurrent bouts. Recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) is a strong risk factor for progression to chronic pancreatitis, an irreversible fibroinflammatory disease that greatly impacts quality of life, and is also a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Increased intraductal pressure is an accepted cause for precipitating an episode of acute pancreatitis. Pancreas divisum, seen in 7-10% of the general population, occurs when the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts have incomplete or nonexistent fusion during early embryologic development. Using this rationale, endoscopists often perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with minor papilla sphincterotomy (miES) in patients who have idiopathic RAP (iRAP) and pancreas divisum with a goal to reduce subsequent attack(s). This practice remains highly controversial, due to major limitations in the available data which are derived almost exclusively from small, retrospective cohort studies with inconsistent and subjective outcomes. This is one of the highest risk indications for ERCP, having post-ERCP pancreatitis rates of 10-20%. A full scale, well-designed clinical trial with adequate follow-up and blinded treatment allocation is clearly needed to empirically evaluate the efficacy of miES in the setting of iRAP and pancreas divisum, including quantifying the cumulative benefit of this intervention on disease burden and to study its relationship with its natural history.  Capitalizing on the existing infrastructure of the recently completed EPISOD trial and NAPS2, we propose a sham-controlled, single blind with a blinded outcome assessment, randomized trial evaluating the impact of miES on the natural history of iRAP in patients with pancreas divisum. The primary outcome is reducing the risk of subsequent acute pancreatitis (time-to-event), with secondary outcome measures being the change in density of attacks, patient-centered outcomes, and progression to chronic pancreatitis. By having an adequate sample size to measure the benefit of ERCP, we will be able to definitively establish the therapeutic role of ERCP in patients with iRAP and pancreas divisum. A biorepository will be established for future exploratory studies of novel risk factors for recurrent acute pancreatitis, progression to chronic pancreatitis and its sequelae, and factors associated with response to miES. Patients fulfilling the entry criteria but refusing enrollment into the randomized trial will be enrolled into an observational cohort. Irrespective of the outcome, this study will have an immediate impact on patient care by confirming or refuting the therapeutic role of ERCP in patients with iRAP and pancreas divisum.  "

"9211215","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Everyday events, such as preparing a meal or working out at the local gym, make up the contents of our daily lives. Prior work has shown that perceiving these events in a normative fashion facilitates memory for the event (Sargent, et al., 2013). However, as a group, older adults and individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD) perceive events less normatively than their younger counterparts (Zacks, et al., 2006). Moreover, normative event perception has been associated with the efficient execution of everyday actions (Bailey, et al., 2013). The ability to remember everyday events and carry out everyday activities safely and efficiently are both important skills that serve to facilitate independent living in older adults. However, many interventions do not demonstrate such far-reaching effects (i.e. Richmond, et al., 2011).  While many cognitive faculties, including event perception, are perturbed by old age, older adults and individuals with early-stage AD are known to have relatively intact implicit learning and implicit memory systems (Knopman & Nissen, 1987; Negash, et al., 2007; Rieckmann & Backman, 2009). The current proposal hypothesizes that by capitalizing on intact implicit cognitive systems by using implicit cueing methods older adults and individuals with early-stage AD might benefit in terms of both normalization in perception of events and improvements in memory for the event itself.  Despite the obvious importance of these abilities, little is known about training methods that could serve boost event perception and event memory. In addition, implicit learning methods have not yet been embedded in rich, naturalistic materials such as those depicting everyday events. To this end, Studies 1-6 will test a variety of different implicit cues for the potential to encourage normative perception (i.e. implicit learning) of an event (Aim #1). Study 7 will investigate the extent to which implicit learning might generalize to untrained contexts and the visual behaviors associated with normative event perception and the sensitivity of the experimental measures to biomarkers associated with AD (Aims #1 & 3). Finally, Study 8 will test whether encouraging normative event perception with the use of implicit cues has an effect on subsequent memory for the event and whether event memory is sensitive to AD biomarkers (Aims #2 & 3). In addition, the extent to which visual behaviors present at important timepoints during the event is related to later event memory will be explored. I predict that (a) implicit cueing will encourage normative event perception, (b) that implicitly learned properties of normative event perception will transfer to uncued materials and (c) implicit learned properties governing normative event perception will have a positive impact on event memory."
"9256329","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application we describe the development of an ultra-high speed Serial Two-Photon (STP) Tomography microscope that can image entire organs with micron resolution in less than a day. It will offer the highest imaging speed and sensitivity available for fluorescent subcellular whole organ imaging. We will accomplish this by implementing a novel multi-foci multiphoton microscope (MMM) version of our current STP system that builds on TissueVision?s founding team?s extensive experience with MMM systems. It will address the two major problems with existing MMMs: 1. Limited field of view due to aberrations induced by the intermediate optics 2. Loss of emission photons in the descanned path. We will present details of a new excitation scheme that avoids aberrations and restricted field of views, and describe a non-descanned detection scheme that employs a high efficiency fiber coupled detection with an original interlaced scanning strategy that minimizes foci crosstalk. This proposal overcomes several long standing technical problems with MMM systems for deep tissue imaging, with a novel MMM design ideally suited for ex vivo whole organ imaging. The ability to fluorescently image a whole organ in 3D at 1 micron XY sampling and 2 micron Z sampling in less than 12 hours and will have a transformative effect on 3D histology and provide a crucial tool for researchers for a vast array of applications in neuroscience and other fields."
"9169143","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary objective of the proposed project is to describe relationships among minority stress, body image distress, impulsivity, and use of substances/alcohol and non-prescription testosterone among transgender female-to-male (FTM) persons. FTMs are male-identified individuals who were assigned female sex at birth. Substance use is a substantial public health risk among FTMs, with FTMs reporting elevated use of substances and alcohol. As well, some FTMs may use non-prescription testosterone to achieve a level of muscularity surpassing what could be obtained by use of prescription doses of testosterone. Transgender FTMs may be at risk for experiencing minority stress and body image distress. Minority stress and body image distress may contribute to transgender FTMs substances/alcohol use to cope with stress, and non-prescription testosterone use to alter their body to a more masculine presentation. As well, impulsivity has been implicated as a moderator of relationship between general stress and use of substances/alcohol such that individuals with higher levels of impulsivity are more likely to use and abuse substances/alcohol compared to those low in impulsivity. Thus, impulsivity may moderate the links between minority stress and body image distress, and substance/alcohol and non-prescription testosterone use, such that higher levels of impulsivity in the context of minority stress and body image distress are associated with increased use of substances/alcohol and testosterone. The aims of the proposed research are to (1) describe the association between minority stress and body image distress, and substance/alcohol use among transgender FTMs and assess whether this relationship is moderated by impulsivity, (2) describe the association between minority stress and body image distress, and non-prescription testosterone use among transgender FTMs and assess whether this relationship is moderated by impulsivity, and (3) describe the relationship between substance/alcohol use and non- prescription testosterone use among transgender FTMs. Results of the proposed research can help to inform future research and interventions focused on substance/alcohol use and use of non-prescription testosterone among this population."

"9272151","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome wide association studies are powerful for correlating human genotype to phenotype. These studies are designed to identify the polymorphisms in the genetic code that are most predictive of a phenotype. Rapid advances in genotyping technologies enable comprehensive coverage of the genome, including a majority of intergenic polymorphisms. Interestingly, when included in the association analysis, non-coding polymorphisms are often the most highly predictive of the phenotype. Furthermore, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are inherited together in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) blocks. As a result, identifying the causative SNP in an LD block mapping to non-coding regions of the genome remains a contemporary computational and experimental challenge in the field of genomics. Although non-coding regions of the genome are not translated into protein, they are in a majority of cases transcribed in RiboNucleic Acid (RNA). Since RNA is a single stranded polymer, it will fold and the higher-order structures it adopts are integral to numerous RNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulatory functions in the cell. In detailed and focused studies of individual transcripts, our team has discovered that disruption of RNA structural features in non-coding regions of transcribed RNAs are causative in at least three human disease states - hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome, retinoblastoma and cartilage hair hypoplasia - and that altered RNA structure determines hepatitis C virus clearance efficiency. The vision of this proposal is to improve our computational ability to predict RiboSNitches (structural features in RNA that are disrupted by a SNP) by improving the accuracy of ensemble suboptimal structure sampling and pseudoknot prediction, and by using chemical structure probing data to characterize allele-specific RNA conformations, both in vitro and in healthy living cells in vivo. Ultimately, this work will substantially improve our ability to predict the causative disease-associated SNP in an LD block mapping to non-coding, intergenic regions of the human genome."

Methods: We propose to conduct a national survey of all EM and Ob/Gyn residents at academic medical centers to understand how gender affects leadership and teamwork (Aim I), develop a simulation-based, gender-sensitive training with the help of national leadership, teamwork, and clinical experts (Aim II), and conduct a RCT of that training with EM and Ob/Gyn resident physicians at selected sites across the country, evaluating the effectiveness of the training through simulation (Aim III). Significance: Leadership is an important element of effective teamwork. In the hospital setting, effective leadership and teamwork leads to greater patient safety. Using simulation to create tailored leadership training that takes into account societal biases about gender and leadership will create better leaders and ultimately create a safer patient healthcare experience."
"9216745","Financial incentives for motivating changes in health behavior, for weight loss in obese individuals, are increasingly being tested by health insurers, employers, and government agencies. However, a key unanswered question regarding weight loss is how to structure these incentive programs to maximize their (1) effectiveness, underscored by the fact that most programs have not resulted in significant long-term weight loss; and (2) economic sustainability, as defined by their return on investment?a major factor in public and private decision-making. Obese patients represent an important population to target for effective weight loss interventions because they suffer from a high prevalence of serious obesity-related illnesses?including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, and cancer?disproportionately have a low socioeconomic status, and impose $147 billion in costs on the healthcare system annually. While prior studies testing financial incentives in this population have had variable short-term success and few have yielded long-term weight loss, a fundamental question remains unanswered and may partially explain variability in weight loss outcomes: specifically, it is unknown whether goal-directed incentives (incentives for achieving evidence-based, intermediate goals that increase weight loss but are underutilized, like dietary counseling, physical activity, behavioral self monitoring, and intensive weight management programs) or outcome-based incentives (like incentives for successfully losing weight) are more effective for promoting weight loss. Prior studies of weight loss incentives have largely emphasized only the latter. We propose a three-arm randomized controlled trial that will address this important knowledge gap among obese patients living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, with implications for other serious chronic health conditions. Comparing goal-directed incentives to outcome-based incentives and usual care, we will assess their impact on weight loss (?5% of baseline weight), use of evidenced-based therapy, and quality of life, and evaluate their short-term and long-term return on investment."
"9297556","PROJECT SUMMARY A growing body of evidence supports the idea that brown/beige adipose tissue (BAT) contributes to basal metabolism in adult humans, and that diminished BAT activity can lead to obesity. Sympathetic nerve stimulation increases BAT activity in rodents. Reports that signaling from the stellate ganglion (SG) modulates thermogenesis in humans, raises the possibility that minimally-invasive approaches to stimulate sympathetic projections from the SG to supraclavicular BAT (scBAT) have potential as an anti-obesity therapy. The neuroanatomy of the SG is complex, because sympathetic and sensory neuronal axons leave the ganglion through 6-8 different exit points to reach a wide variety of targets in the periphery. For neuromodulation of SG projections to BAT to have clinical applications, it is essential that stimulation protocols avoid projections from the SG to the heart and upper extremities. In theory, this can be achieved by physically focusing the electrical stimulus to SG neurons as they exit the SG or enter the scBAT depot. Alternatively, genetic approaches could be used restrict pharmacological manipulations to the subpopulation of SG neurons that innervates BAT. These complementary studies in mouse models and human tissue samples will serve as the basis for deciding which of these strategies are viable therapeutic options. The proposed studies are designed to fill critical information gaps and to develop tools needed for comprehensive mapping of neural circuits regulating BAT and to explore the potential use of BAT neuromodulation as an anti- obesity therapy. Studies in Aim 1 will use combinations of transgenic mouse models and fluorescent neuronal tracers to determine whether there is any physical overlap between BAT and forelimb-projecting soma within the SG or their exit points out of the SG. In parallel, we will perform the first mapping studies of the projections from the SG to scBAT in human autopsy specimens. A major obstacle to studies to modulate or record neural activity in the SG is that this ganglion contains many different types of afferent and efferent neurons that regulate a wide range of physiological functions. Studies in Aim 2 will define molecular markers for distinct subpopulations of SG neurons that project to BAT and heart. Then we will determine whether any of these markers are conserved in human surgical samples. Finally, studies in Aim 3 will establish systems to evaluate the impact of neuromodulation on the organization of sympathetic fibers in conjunction with well-established assays to measure BAT oxidative capacity and activity. To aid these efforts, we will develop techniques to image sympathetic projections in an intact BAT depot. In addition, we will validate key in vivo assays needed to assess the impacts of neuromodulation on BAT function that can be readily translated to humans. In addition to impacts on the BAT field, these studies will also provide a strong foundation for future efforts to understand how existing SG neuromodulation therapies have beneficial effects on a wide range of conditions that are refractory to other treatments, including ventricular tachycardia, chronic regional pain syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder."
"9188443","PROJECT SUMMARY We have shown that some types of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) induce oxidative stress, alter macrophage gene regulation and phagocytic function, and increase the susceptibility of mice to Streptococcus pneumonia, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia. Increased risks of pneumonia are a major health outcome associated with human exposure to ultrafine environmental particulates, particularly in the elderly. Our goal is to develop and test a framework for prediction of ENM effects on infection susceptibility, using mechanism-based in vitro assays of macrophage function. We hypothesize exposure to ENMs compromises innate immune function and enhances susceptibility to lung infections through redox-mediated signaling mechanisms that alter macrophage polarization and impair phagocytic clearance of pathogens. We also propose that protein S-glutathionylation (SSG), a major form of protein oxidative modification that regulates multiple aspects of innate immunity, contribute as molecular initiative events for ENM toxicity. Aim 1 will use novel redox protoemics methods to identify the protein targets of SSG induced by ENMs and the major pathways that are most sensitive to these modifications. Aim 2 will identify macrophage transcriptional pathways impacted by ENMs and how exposure to ENMs modulate phagocytic activity toward S. pneumonia. We will investigate how the most robust SSG modifications and mRNA pathways affected by ENMs are co- regulated, and develop sensitive assays to quantify these markers in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3 will test whether in vitro assays for macrophage function and pathway markers identified in Aims 1-2 accurately predict whether inhalation exposure to ENMs modulates lung infections in both young and aged mice challenged with S. pneumonia. Advanced nanomaterial dosimetry models will be used to derive equivalent human exposure levels that would be required to induce these effects. The ability to accurately predict adverse outcomes of ENMs from mechanism-based in vitro studies will transform hazard and risk approaches for emerging ENMs, and addresses a broader human health problem associated with environmental particulate exposures."
"9355288","Summary Gastroparesis is a disorder of gastric function characterized by delay in gastric emptying, frequently associated with chronic nausea and vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, and malnutrition that may require nutritional support. The broad objectives of this proposal is to improve our understanding of this disorder and advancing the diagnosis and treatment of gastroparesis and related disorders. We propose to do this through three specific aims, as follows: Specific Aim 1: To maintain, expand, and refine the Gastroparesis Registry in order to enable critical additional and new analyses of the clinical data and biosamples. Specific Aim 2: To conduct a randomized controlled trial of aprepitant in patients with gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia-postprandial distress syndrome. Specific Aim 3: To conduct a pilot and feasibility trial of a potential disease modifying approach using pioglitazone in patients with gastroparesis"
"9338994","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of our ongoing project, Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases, is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to relevant problems. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) greatly amplifies the ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the EHR carries additional challenges. We believe that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. Put another way, EHR data are not simply research data with more noise and missing some values; instead the EHR carries systematic biases that must be addressed before the data can reach their potential. We propose to characterize the effects of the health care process on EHR data, to enumerate the potential biases, and to provide mechanisms to circumvent them. In effect, we propose to study the EHR as an object of interest in itself, using new models, data mining, existing knowledge bases, and innovative algorithms to better understand EHR biases so that we can identify them and correct them or avoid them. We include expertise from two of the nation's major phenotyping projects, eMERGE and OMOP.     We hypothesize that we can learn about biases due to the health process through data mining and knowledge engineering and that we can correct or at least avoid those biases, enabling us to better answer informatics and clinical questions. Our aims are as follows: (1) Study health care process biases by correlating raw EHR variables with a panel of health care process-related variables (e.g., admission), using lagged correlation to account for temporal effects, and populating a health care process resource with the correlations and observations. (2) Find associations among raw EHR variables using lagged correlation, information theory, Granger causality, and temporally ordered N-tuples of events, correcting for the health care process biases discovered in Aim 1. (3) Facilitate the definition of higher-level clinical phenotype concepts by applying knowledge resources-including eMERGE and OMOP phenotype definitions and ontologies such as our Medical Entities Dictionary and the UMLS-to the fruit of Aims 1 and 2 to produce semi-automated and automated phenotype query definitions. (4) Develop a high-throughput method to validate phenotype definitions by measuring the ability to uncover known associations, use the generated phenotypes and associations to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results, including a large knowledge base of correlations that can be used by other researchers to conduct their own studies."
"9111161","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the promising results from stem cell therapy in spinal cord injury, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) present an intermediate solution with short in vivo life span. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide an alternative source for novel cell therapy, but the engraftment of hiPSC-NPCs needs to be improved. The formation of microtissues of hiPSC-NPCs and MSCs could up-regulate the secretion of trophic factors from MSCs and NPCs, and the secretion of anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory factors from MSCs to enhance NPC engraftment at injury site. However, the complex heterotypic interactions of MSCs with hiPSC-NPCs and their secretory activities during neurogenesis have not been well understood.} The objective of this proposal is to construct 3-D microtissues composed of human MSCs and hiPSC-derived NPCs, and investigate the impact of heterotypic cell-cell interactions on the secretion of extracellular matrices and trophic factors during neural differentiation in vitro. The central hypothesis is that  the heterotypic cell-cell interactions and the secretion of endogenous extracellular matrices are modulated by the structure of microtissues of MSCs and hiPSC- derived NPCs which promote trophic factor section and functional neural differentiation. Specifically, the following aims are proposed: 1) Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the composition and structure of microtissues differentially regulates the secretion of trophic factors, NPC differentiation, and cell survival under oxidative stress. 2) Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the structure of microtissues regulates the secretion of endogenous ECMs to stimulate neurogenesis. {Neural microtissue self-assembly from hiPSCs in vitro was chosen by Science's editors as a runner-up for 2013 Breakthrough of the Year. By their unique ability to coordinate the dictatorial signals and to form  tissue or mini-organ like structures reminiscent of cell organization in vivo, hiPSCs and their derivatives provide a novel platform to advance our understanding on tissue morphogenesis for the treatment of neurological disorders. The most innovative feature of this project is to evaluate  microtissue-based neural differentiation by fabricating hybrid MSC-NPC microtissues with tunable structure to achieve the enhanced cellular function and neurogenesis. If successful, the proposed study will advance our understanding on the actions of hiPSC-derived NPCs and MSCs in treating neural injury and on the modulation of extracellular microenvironment during neurogenesis."
"9180620","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatitis is a prevalent, costly, and potentially life-threatening clinical problem for which the pathophysiology is poorly understood and treatment options are extremely limited. This disease is characterized by acinar cell dysfunction leading to inappropriate activation of trypsin. A variety of pancreatitis models suggest that metabolic perturbations resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant autophagy might play an early and central role in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Research in our laboratory centers on the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disease. We recently discovered that a mitochondrial enzyme known as carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) is essential for acinar cell survival. Remarkably, conditional genetic ablation of CrAT in adult mice leads to rapid and massive acinar death with morphological changes consistent with pancreatitis. This finding raises the intriguing questions of why this event is so catastrophic in these cells, and do similar  perturbations occur in the context of pancreatic disease? CrAT is a freely reversible enzyme that transfers two-carbon acetyl groups between CoA and L-carnitine, which permits shuttling of acetyl moieties between the mitochondria and other cellular compartments. Studies in skeletal muscle show that this shuttle system buffers metabolic transitions between states of high and low energy demand, and thereby maintains mitochondrial acetyl group balance while also modulating production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This project aims to delineate the role of CrAT in acinar cell function using state-of-the-art metabolomics and molecular physiology approaches. Results from these studies could provide new and important clues to understanding the molecular basis of pancreatitis."
"9278948","SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) is a Flavivirus that has recently emerged in the Western hemisphere as a major viral pathogen. The virus was discovered in 1947 and the majority of ZIKV-associated diseases were considered to be mild. However, the recent outbreak, as well as the preceding outbreaks in the South Pacific Ocean region has been associated with an increased number of neurological sequellae including Guillian-Barré Syndrome. The most notable increase in pathogenesis has been the ZIKV infection of pregnant women and associated developmental abnormalities observed in the fetus including microcephaly. Zika viral RNA has been detected in pregnant mothers, the fetal brain as well as amniotic fluid. ZIKV infections during pregnancy have been associated with an increased prevalence of placental insufficiency and intra-uterine growth restriction. However, the mechanisms of causation of these pathologies between maternal ZIKV infections to the clinical adverse neonatal neurological outcomes have yet to be defined. In addition, how the timing of virus infection during pregnancy affects these outcomes is still unknown. We have developed a nonhuman primate model of ZIKV infection in 5 adult rhesus monkeys including 3 females. We have determined the optimal viral dosage and characterized viral distribution, innate and adaptive immunity and clinical outcomes. One important finding is that the virus remains persistent in tissues including those of the female reproductive tract. We are also currently characterizing the infection of one pregnant Rhesus macaque, which has demonstrated dramatic changes in placental blood flow and a relative decrease in fetal brain size. We hypothesize that maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy negatively impacts utero-placental perfusion and initiates a fetal and placental inflammatory response that contributes to the development of microcephaly and other aberrations of fetal development. The goal of this project is determine whether the timing of ZIKV infection during fetal gestation (1st, 2nd or 3rd trimesters) affects the ability of the virus to cause fetal developmental abnormalities. Utilizing our unique non-human primate (NHP) catheterized pregnancy model in conjunction with state-of-the art MRI and ultrasonography, our multidisciplinary team of investigators will further our understanding of the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection during pregnancy and the severity of fetal neurological injury."
"9148356","PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal uses an innovative method, Unannounced Standardized Patient (USPs) visits, to describe the transfer of and response to social and behavioral determinants of health in outpatient care among primary care teams. The overall goal is to contribute to our understanding of the factors underlying disparities in outpatient quality of care and safety. Behavioral and social determinants of health, while major influences on the effectiveness of treatment and ultimately on health, are often neglected by health care providers and represent common errors of omission. Outpatient safety depends on accurate collection and documentation of patient-provided information and yet there are few viable methods for systematically tracing patient-provided information through a visit and subsequent health team interactions. USPs provide an innovative method for exposing the health care team to a standardized ?dose? of information that then can be tracked. The study proceeds in two phases: The first phase (Aim 1) introduces highly standardized/controlled information into the primary care process through the use of USP scenarios developed specifically to ?test? the team response to social and behavioral information and assesses transfer of that information from patient to team, from team member to team member, into the EHR, and into treatment plans and follow-up (n=4 teams). In the second phase, a longitudinal cohort design (Aims 2 and 3), we will provide 4 teams with monthly audit feedback data on their performance (for 20 months) and monitor rates of information transfer and response and also explore the degree to which characteristics of team members, teams, and the clinic sites are associated with team performance (Aim 3). We will compare the performance of teams in this feedback group with a comparison group of 2 teams that do not receive feedback. Thus, this proposal uses Unannounced Standardized Patients as a ?test-bed? for understanding and improving clinical processes, and therefore safety, in outpatient care for vulnerable patients."
"9167293","Project Summary/Abstract This application seeks to assess a new mechanism for aging-related alterations in cell and tissue function. The proposed studies will determine if our recent discovery and preliminary data regarding a previously unrecognized mechanism for signal transduction---direct, membrane-delimited activation of matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14, also known as MMT1-MMP [membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase] by GTP and GTP?S acting via heterotrimeric (???) GTP binding (G) proteins?contribute to such alterations, in particular in cardiac cells and the heart. We find that GTP-promoted activation of MMP14 releases (?sheds?) proteins from the membrane, including heparin binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and leads to activation of EGF receptors, thus identifying a new mechanism by which G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)/heterotrimeric G-proteins transactivate receptor tyrosine kinases. Our preliminary data indicate that MMP14 activity and its activation by GTP?S is increased in cardiac cell membranes from aged mice. We propose that this increase in MMP14 activity is a consequence of age-related alterations in the plasma membrane, in particular a loss in caveolin proteins, which scaffold signaling molecules. The Aims of the studies proposed in this R21 application are to: 1) Define the heterotrimeric G-protein subunit(s) that activate MMP14, the mechanism of its activation by the G-proteins, and of the aging-related increase in MMP14 activity through co-localization with caveolins and loss of caveolin- mediated inhibition of MMP14 and 2) Determine the ability of MMP14 activation by G-proteins to release membrane proteins and activate extracellular proteins, (e.g., soluble MMPs) and to assess the role of MMP14 in aging-related loss in cardiac cell function, including in isolated hearts. Our working hypothesis, which the proposed studies will test, is that MMP14 is part of a GPCR/G-protein/MMP14/MMP14 targets signaling module that is altered in aging as a consequence of aging-related changes in membrane structure. Our preliminary data provide evidence in support of this idea. We believe that those data and our past efforts related to G-protein- mediated signaling and combined efforts of those involved in this project will facilitate success in the proposed studies. In addition, we believe that the results will provide novel information of relevance to biochemical and physiological changes that occur in aging as well as results of interest to multiple disciplines (biochemistry, cell biology, physiology/pathophysiology and pharmacology). Moreover, the findings may also be relevant to other tissues and cell types besides the cardiovascular cells that we will study in the proposed experiments and may identify new targets for the prevention and/or treatment of aging-related disorders."

The proposed training program is designed around a research project that will examine the relationship between alcohol outlet density and pedestrian injury in Baltimore City, with an emphasis on the impact of both the built and social environment on pedestrian injury in areas of greater alcohol outlet density. The applicant hypothesizes that more pedestrian injuries occur in areas of greater alcohol outlet density. Additionally, she hypothesizes that more pedestrian injuries occur in areas of greater resource deprivation and physical disorder, and in areas of greater social disorganization and incivility. Finally, she hypothesizes that there is a synergistic effect between physical and socia disorder that contributes to increased pedestrian injuries in areas of greater alcohol outlet density.  This project is supported by a strong, interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants, including faculty members with backgrounds in [alcohol epidemiology, health disparities, biostatistics and spatial analysis, and injury prevention.] Dr. Debra Furr-Holden, the  project Sponsor, is an authority in measurement of drug and alcohol use disorders; design and evaluation of alcohol-related interventions; and methods to reduce health disparities.

"9235006","Summary mRNA-binding proteins play a pivotal role in the development and function of the nervous system and defects in the function of these proteins underlie a broad spectrum of neurological pathologies. Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is a paradigm of disease-associated RNA-binding proteins because of its essential contribution to the development and activity of the brain and its central role in several human disorders that affect hundreds of thousands people. The loss of FMRP due to transcriptional silencing or protein mutations leads to Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common familial cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism that currently lacks an efficient medical treatment. On the molecular level, the absence of functional FMRP results in exaggerated protein biosynthesis that is normally held in check by FMRP-mediated translational repression of selected mRNAs. Previous studies have reported mostly conflicting datasets of FMRP targets, and despite its vital importance, the mechanism of mRNA selection by FMRP remains unclear. This lack of definitive knowledge on the principles of FMRP-RNA recognition limits both understanding of FXS and the development of rational therapeutic approaches for its treatment. Our preliminary structural data suggest that FMRP can bind RNA in sequence-specific manner and that RNA binding of FMRP is not truly promiscuous. The objective of this proposal is to determine specific RNA targets for human FMRP and understand the molecular principles of FMRP-RNA recognition. The hypothesis is that RNA-binding domains of FMRP recognize RNA sequence- specifically and that combinations of these RNA motifs determine binding to natural RNAs. To test this hypothesis, FMRP binding sites will be identified using a novel biochemical approach and structural studies. Specific Aim 1 is devoted to identification of short RNA sequences that bind specifically to isolated KH domains of FMRP by using a novel ?bottom-up? approach that combines RNA capture experiments with Next Generation Sequencing. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the molecular features of FMRP that are essential for specific RNA binding by using biochemical methods and X-ray crystallography. Specific Aim 3 will aim to develop mutant FMRP proteins with altered RNA specificity to study various FMRP functions. Together, these results will define RNA sequence elements required for interactions with FMRP, help to identify natural RNA targets of FMRP, and design mutant FMRP proteins to interrogate various FMRP functions in the animal models of FXS. The proposal is highly relevant to public health and the NIH mission since it will provide insights on the RNA recognition and the mechanism of FMRP-mediated translational inhibition, the activities associated with development of FXS, autism and other disorders. Understanding how FMRP functions will advance searches for novel therapeutic interventions against FXS and related diseases."
"9353044","The Adult Children Study (ACS) is an ongoing evaluation of middle to older adults at risk for development of Alzheimer disease (AD). In Project 4 of the ACS, we use a combination of advanced imaging techniques to explore the earliest signs of AD pathology. Using positron emission tomography (PET) we test for amyloid protein deposits in the brain, which can be present up to 20 years before dementia symptoms are present. We will do this using florbetapir F18, which is a test for amyloid which has approval by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we evaluate the functional changes in the brain associated with the transition from the asymptomatic (preclinical) stages of AD into the symptomatic stage of AD dementia. We also use MRI to evaluate the brain?s structure, looking at grey matter atrophy with volumetric MRI, and investigate the changes in white matter using a new technique, diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI). In collaboration with Project 4, in Aim 1, we will generate unique brain maps for each imaging test, in each stage of AD, as people move from an asymptomatic state into AD dementia. In Aim 2, we will then examine these maps in relation to one another, to develop an integrated timeline for the imaging changes which occur during the transition from asymptomatic and symptomatic AD. We will then use these maps as a way to predict the stage of the disease in specific individuals ? in other words, to predict how long it would be before someone developed dementia. This mapping and predictive information is critical for the development of new drugs for AD and for the appropriate design of clinical trials in the future."
"9167046","Project Summary Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Conventional approaches to studying tuberculosis transmission, and to early case detection, have been based on individual-level screening. Because of the long, subclinical phase of tuberculosis, during which infectious individuals have many casual contacts, understanding where transmission occurs in community settings has been a vexing challenge. Social network and molecular epidemiologic studies indicate that over 80% of transmission cannot be linked to close contacts or household members. Additionally, this prolonged period of transmission prior to healthcare-seeking makes tuberculosis difficult to control. Active case finding approaches, which involve screening individuals prior to care-seeking, are resource-intensive due to the high number-needed- to-test and have not been sustainable in most high burden countries. Here, we propose a fundamentally new approach to tuberculosis detection that would overcome these limitations: identifying M. tuberculosis in the shared air of congregate settings. Using custom-built air sampling devices and highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic techniques, we will rigorously investigate this approach with three fundamental, real- world applications. The first is to evaluate congregate air sampling as a group screening method for early case detection of tuberculosis, and to identify optimal sampling approaches through empirical data collection and model-based analysis. The second application is to identify high-risk environments for tuberculosis transmission, through systematic air sampling in public settings throughout a highly endemic South African township. The third is to efficiently generate population-level tuberculosis prevalence estimates by combining air sampling and social mixing data, and applying statistical inferential models based upon pooled diagnostic sampling. This project will generate critical data on this new population-based approach to M. tuberculosis detection, and will develop an epidemiologic and statistical framework with which to translate this into a tool for surveillance and early case detection."
"9207389","Project Summary/Abstract  Among the 62,400 Youth Living with HIV (YLH) aged 12-24 years old, 36% are linked to health care and only 6% of YLH are virally suppressed.1 It is imperative that YLH achieve viral suppression in order to reduce the probability of infecting others, as well as increasing the length and quality of their own life. Stepped Care is a strategy used in managing other chronic diseases, not yet applied to HIV. Providers implement the least intensive intervention needed to achieve the treatment goal and intensify the intervention until the treatment goal is achieved. Study 2 tests a Stepped Care Model to achieve viral suppression ? by increasing adherence to the HIV Treatment Continuum.  This U19's strategy for retaining the cohort, monitoring outcomes, and linking YLH to care is the Standard Care Condition in Study 2 (labeled Prototype Retention/Prevention Strategy in other cores or studies) and will be combined by an Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention (AMMI) for YLH. The Stepped Care arm will have three levels of intervention: Level 1: Standard Care; Level 2: a Peer Support and AMMI (PS-AMMI) plus the Standard Care; and Level 3: a Coach plus PS-AMMI plus the Standard Care. The PS-AMMI and Coaching will be both in-person contacts, as well as on social media, texting, and probes to monitor behaviors over time. Having a detectable viral load at a 4 month assessment, triggers increasing intensity in the level of intervention provided.  YLH with established HIV infection (N=220) will be identified by screening each youth seeking services at five homeless shelters and gay-identified community based organizations in Los Angeles and New Orleans. The sample is expected to be 79% male Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender YLH (GBTY), 5% heterosexual males, 71% African-American, 15% Latino, and 16% female. The YLH will be randomly assigned during the recruitment process when it is determined that the YLH has an established HIV infection by the interviewer in the Recruitment, Engagement, and Retention Center (RERC).Over 24 months, viral load will be monitored as the primary outcomes with dried blood spots. Secondary outcomes will be sexually transmitted infection (STI), serious substance abuse, and retention in care and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy adherence. The study will examine the mediating effect of reducing substance use and reducing depression on viral suppression, as well document the frequency and type of life challenges and barriers YLH experience to achieve viral suppression and how the quality of the peer support and coaching may impact outcomes. The results of this study will potentially influence CDC's policies on how to diffuse evidence-based practices and provide CDC with good estimates on the costs of repeat testing among GBTY."
"9270725","ABSTRACT Preterm birth (PTB) complicates one in six pregnancies in the Global South and kills one million newborns per year. Maternal HIV is among the most common serious complications of pregnancy in many settings and is associated with a higher risk of PTB. As combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become available to an ever-growing number of pregnant women around the world, perinatal HIV transmission rates have plummeted, but a new complication has emerged. ART in pregnancy appears to increase the risk of PTB even beyond that attributable to HIV infection itself. Antenatal vaginal progesterone (VP) has been found in randomized trials to reduce the risk of PTB among women with a prior preterm birth or sonographic evidence of cervical shortening; it is standard of care for this latter indication in the United States. We hypothesize that VP might prevent PTB among women receiving ART in pregnancy. However, we are concerned about the feasibility of a full-scale efficacy trial, given recent reports from HIV microbicide and pre-exposure prophylaxis studies suggesting low adherence among women randomized to receive vaginal study drug. In this application, we propose to study the feasibility of a trial of VP to prevent PTB among women receiving ART in pregnancy (AIM 1). The trial will screen women with ultrasound biometry and offer enrollment prior to 24 weeks gestation. A total of 140 women will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to daily self-administration of either VP or matched placebo. The trial?s primary outcome will be adherence, defined as the proportion of participants who achieve 80% use of study product. We will assess adherence objectively with a validated dye stain assay (DSA) that can reliably confirm vaginal insertion among returned single-use VP applicators. We will also measure study uptake (proportion of women who agree to participate in the trial if offered), retention (proportion of participants who remain in the trial until delivery), and preliminary efficacy (difference in the rates of birth prior to 37 weeks between the randomization groups). In a set of concurrent qualitative activities, we will seek a nuanced understanding of the personal, social, and structural barriers to trial participation and adherence to study product (AIM 2). We will invite women who decline enrollment in the trial to participate in semi-structured interviews (SSIs) to assess perceived risk of PTB, desire for an intervention proposed to prevent PTB, attitudes towards VP, and barriers to trial participation. We will then invite women enrolled in the study to participate in longitudinal SSIs to explore factors affecting trial retention and adherence to a daily self-administered vaginal product."
"9239450","1 Project Summary  2 Despite the significant advantages of preventing Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the growing  3 evidence that shows the benefits of the HPV vaccine, vaccine uptake among eligible girls and boys (i.e., 9-17  4 year olds) in the U.S. has been suboptimal. Current efforts have increased vaccination rates marginally, but  5 remain low and far from the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%. In 2013, only 37% of eligible adolescent girls  6 received the full 3 doses of the vaccine and only 15% of boys. Persistent HPV infection precedes HPV driven  7 cancers by years, in some cases decades, but if current levels of HPV driven cancer cases continue, the  8 vaccine has the potential to prevent over 25,000 cases yearly among current adolescents in the U.S. Hispanic  9 girls and boys in the U.S. have similar vaccination rates, though adult Hispanics exhibit greater HPV driven 10 cancer disparities, supporting an even stronger case to create tailored interventions to increase the vaccination 11 rates in this growing population. The most common barriers cited by Latino parents for vaccinating their 12 children are lack of knowledge about the vaccine or HPV in general and lack of provider recommendation, but 13 if recommended, most ?will certainly get the vaccine for their child.? Our research has yielded a 78% 14 vaccination completion rate as compared to 17%. This pilot study is the impetus of the current proposal, to 15 conduct a larger, definitive randomized trial for the effectiveness of the EdTech-HPV (Community Approach 16 using Education and Technology to Increase HPV Vaccination) intervention among Latinos. Project goals are: 17 1: To conduct a randomized controlled trial for the effectiveness of a community-based HPV vaccination 18 program that targets Mexican-American parents of HPV vaccine eligible children. 2: To develop a multi-level 19 statistical predictive model on vaccination series completion. This intervention is based on evidence supporting 20 community based programs to increase immunizations, particularly among immigrant parents of eligible 21 children. The Mexican population in the U.S. is the largest and fastest growing Latino population. For over 10 22 years the Ventanilla de Salud (VDS) at Mexican consulates in the U.S has promoted the health of their 23 nationals and provided extensive assistance in disease prevention matters, within a safe and culturally 24 appropriate environment. Four VDS locations across the country will participate in this project (New York City, 25 Las Vegas, El Paso and Chicago) providing access to a diverse Mexican population living in dissimilar 26 environments. Parents in the study will participate in a structured, one-on-one educational session addressing 27 all aspects of HPV. A subsample will be randomly assigned to receive text messaging reminders to initiate 28 vaccination and to obtain the second and third doses. All subjects will be assessed, through provider 29 verification, for initiating their child's vaccine at completion of the doses. Achieving the aims of this project will 30 cement a replicable, community based model to reduce health disparities in the broader Latino population."
"9357872","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in executive function and has been implicated in sensory working memory and attention. The cognitive dysfunctions found in schizophrenia and other mental disorders has been linked to the dysfunction of PFC, and thus, understanding the functional circuitry that mediates cognitive function in PFC is of major relevance to the study of mental illness.  In spite of the evidence that the influence of PFC on sensory cortex is important for cognitive function, the nature of this influence is still poorly understood. To understand such influences it is important to determine how PFC represents signals it receives from sensory neurons. To examine this problem we chose tasks involving visual motion since its neural code and motion processing cortical areas have been examined in some detail. Our goal is to characterize the representation of visual motion in the PFC and to examine the top-down influences it provides to motion processing area MT. During the past grant period we showed that at the fovea the majority of the PFC neurons show direction selective (DS) responses, suggesting their MT origins. We also characterized the circuitry involved in assigning task relevance to such stimuli and characterized in detail memory-related signals its neurons carry. We now examine whether the representation of motion in the PFC across space reflects the local nature of the bottom-up motion signals arriving from MTs in both hemispheres (Aim #1). This information has important implications for the way the PFC interprets sensory signals appearing in different portions of the visual field and for its top-down influences on the highly retinotopic and stimulus selective MT neurons. We will use reversible inactivation of the PFC to determine its influence on activity of MT neurons during all components of memory for motion tasks (Aim #2) and its contribution to behavioral performance of these tasks (Aim #3). We will record spiking activity and local field potentials as measure motion thresholds while monkeys compare directions or speeds of two sequential moving stimuli presented within and between contralateral and ipsilateral hemifields.  These studies will provide new information about the way PFC represents and controls sensory signals used during working memory tasks. The results will have important implications for elucidating the basis of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, long associated with deficits in sensory working memory and impaired prefrontal function."

Clinton, MD, PhD,  has a collaborative team of 37 basic, translational and clinical scientists. These faculty have appointments in  17 Departments/Divisions within the Colleges of Medicine, Arts and Sciences, Pharmacy, Food Agriculture and  Environmental Sciences, Public Health, Dentistry, Education and Human Ecology and Veterinary Medicine.  The Specific Aims of the MCC Program are: 1) to characterize molecular and cellular changes induced by  chemical, physical, hormonal and infectious agents that contribute to neoplastic transformation and multistage  carcinogenesis in experimental models and humans; 2) to develop and characterize novel agents for cancer  chemoprevention and define their efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action using in vitro and preclinical  models; and 3) to identify dietary and nutritional components that may enhance or inhibit the carcinogenesis  cascade across the continuum of cancer progression. Each of these aims results in translational prevention  studies in human populations with an emphasis on those at risk due to exposure to carcinogenic or cancer  promoting agents, familial and genetic predisposition, or due to the presence of premalignant lesions.  The MCC Program's overarching goals, implemented through multiple MCC initiatives, are to accelerate the  research objectives of each Aim through incentivizing and stimulating collaborative investigation among MCC  members, other investigators of the OSUCCC as well as facilitating the implementation of translational studies  of cancer etiology, prevention, and progression in human trials. The MCC enhances quality by promoting  knowledge of and utilization of state-of-the-art technologies provided by the OSUCCC shared resources  (members utilize 14/14 shared resources).  The MCC Program, during its previous review (2004-2009) was graded as ?Outstanding to Exceptional?.  During this funding period (2009-2014), MCC Program members published 484 cancer relevant peer-reviewed  articles in top tier journals for the respective fields of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention, and nutrition.  Collaboration is extensive with 28% intra-programmatic publications and 55% inter-programmatic publications,  with 272 or 56% being multi-institutional and 447 or 92% being collaborative publications. Peer-reviewed  funding for the MCC Program is $5.19M in annual direct costs with $2.9M (56%) from the NCI. Translational  research has been robust as well with 20 human trials led by MCC members employing the OSUCCC Clinical  Trials Office resulting in 360 interventional accruals during the last funding cycle, 72% of which were from  investigator-initiated Phase I and II trials. The current MCC Program uniquely integrates investigators across  disciplines yet with shared interests focusing upon the interactive themes of carcinogenesis, chemoprevention,  and nutrition. Our future goals include the integration of new initiatives involving the microbiome and  metabolomics, two areas benefiting from rapid growth in technology and bioinformatics that will dramatically  impact our understanding of carcinogenesis and strategies for cancer prevention."

"9340827","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become the third most common cause of death in the U.S., and the number of COPD-associated deaths has doubled over the past 20 years. Age, environmental, and genetic factors affect COPD development and progression. While studies of COPD have evaluated different aspects of lung physiology, pathology, and function very little in vivo information exists on the structure and the role of the acinar airways, even though these airways represent 95% of the lung volume and function as the major gas-exchanging unit. This proposal has an overarching goal of developing a new understanding of the effects of aging, cigarette smoking, and COPD on the lung, by measuring and differentiating all aspects of the structural changes in acinar airways among these conditions. We also aim to understand the interplay between disease of small conducting airways and changes in the structure of acinar airways in regions of gas trapping which are thought to be early events leading to emphysema.  Building on our prior discovery of anisotropic 3He gas diffusion in acinar airways, we developed and validated the innovative imaging technique of lung morphometry with hyperpolarized 3He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that provides unique in vivo quantitative information on the structure and spatial distribution of acinar airways for this study. We will combine 3He morphometric data with quantitative CT data to obtain unique information on parenchymal (alveolar walls including capillaries) and non-parenchymal (non-capillary vessels, etc.) lung tissue, as well as on disease of small conducting airways. Our Specific Aims focus on establishing quantitative relationships between structural alterations in acinar and small airways and declines in lung function:  Aim 1: Identify and compare structural mechanisms of the progressive deterioration in lung function associated with aging in healthy never-smokers and healthy smokers, and differentiate contributions of acinar and small airway disease, by using quantitative metrics determined by MRI-based in vivo lung morphometry and quantitative CT.  Aim 2: Identify the structural mechanisms of the progressive deterioration in lung function associated with smoking-related COPD, and differentiate the mechanisms of age-related structural changes in the acinar and small airways (in healthy never-smokers and healthy smokers) from those due to COPD, by using quantitative metrics determined by MRI-based in vivo lung morphometry and quantitative CT.  We expect to develop a new approach for assessing the effects of aging and COPD on lung structure and function, provide a new understanding of how aging, cigarette smoking, and emphysema cause lung acinar structural changes and associated deterioration in lung function, and propose novel targets for preventing and treating the major public health problem of COPD."
"9305184","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia (lazy eye) and strabismus (misaligned eyes) are medical eye conditions that combine as the leading causes of preventable vision loss in children. They are irreversible if not detected and corrected by the age of seven, however half of all cases are missed because the conditions do not always manifest themselves and pediatricians are unable to reliably detect the conditions. The current health care system badly needs an accurate and effective approach toward detecting amblyopia and strabismus in preschool children, and this application aims to show that REBIScan's Pediatric Vision Scanner is capable of detecting disease, including the most difficult for providers to diagnose, with a hig level of accuracy within a primary clinic with lay users as screeners.  The study will be conducted in busy, ethnically and racially diverse primary care sites operated by the Kaiser Permanente system, with outcomes and efficiency of testing compared to the current standard of care.  The research proposed in this SBIR application will complete the last significant milestones necessary for commercialization of the PVS. While the technology has been tested in enriched populations, there are no studies that test device performance when lay users perform testing in a busy pediatric setting, and usability has not been tested in the primary care setting.  The Specific Aims will advance the health outcomes of children by using a scientifically rigorous approach to provide the efficiency and accuracy data that clinicians, investors, and payors require before the PVS can be adopted commercially. A two-phase study has been designed to compare the Pediatric Vision Scanner to the standard of care today. The first phase includes a sample population of older children in whom a limited Gold Standard Examination (visual acuity testing and non-cycloplegic autorefraction) is easily performed by a non-specialist in the primary care clinic. A linkage study will then be performed on a larger group of younger children who will receive the complete Gold Standard Examination.  If the results of this study are similar to published studies performed with enriched populations, then the NIH will have funded a technology that has the potential to change the world and the way it detects amblyopia and strabismus."
"9254970","ABSTRACT Mechanical ventilation refers to the use of life-support technology to perform the work of breathing for patients suffering from respiratory failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are disproportionately older and suffer from multiple chronic conditions: Approximately half of these patients are older than 65, and half suffer from multiple chronic conditions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with a higher likelihood of death as a result of complications from ventilator associated conditions (VAC), the most lethal of which is ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Approximately 10 to 20% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAP, and patients suffering from VAP are twice as likely to die compared to similar patients without VAP. In addition, approximately 80% of mechanically ventilated patients will develop delirium. Currently, most institutions take a one-size-fits-all ?bundled? approach to mitigate ventilator associated complications. This wastes healthcare resources on patients who will not benefit while simultaneously denying additional potentially life-saving resources from patients who are most likely to benefit from vigorous prophylactic interventions. In this Phase 1 SBIR study, we will design models to predict with a high degree of accuracy which patients will likely develop VAC, VAP and delirium. Current care focuses on the disease (i.e., respiratory failure) as opposed to the patient. Our vision is to put this tool into the hands of hospital caregivers, which we will do during Phase 2 of this SBIR. Successful completion of the proposed work will alter the current bundled approach to the care of mechanically ventilated patients such that the care becomes tailored to the needs of each individual patient. Furthermore, this work will facilitate the early application of targeted prevention interventions to reduce the frequency of VAC, pneumonia and delirium in mechanically ventilated patients, thus improving patient outcomes. Finally, the developed models will provide critical prognostic information for providers and patients, facilitating shared decision-making and care planning."
"9184049","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sleep plays a critical role in long-term memory consolidation, or the stabilization of recent memories over time.  In humans, non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, compared to time spent awake, is associated with enhanced memory retention and the stabilization of memory representations across hippocampal-cortical networks.  Specific physiological mechanisms during post-encoding sleep are thought to support such memory stabilization:  slow wave activity or slow oscillations, which coordinate and synchronize large-scale neural activity during NREM sleep, and the reactivation of hippocampal activity patterns representative of prior experience (`reactivation') during wide-spread hippocampal-cortical network interactions.  A functional role of slow waves for the retention of recent memories has been shown in humans, and robust evidence for memory- related hippocampal reactivation and associated hippocampal network interactions has been shown during NREM sleep in rodents.  However, it is unclear from prior work 1):  which brain regions are critically necessary for the generation of slow waves that support successful NREM memory consolidation, with prior work indicating a predominance of slow wave density and origin over medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and 2):  whether mechanisms of hippocampal reactivation and large-scale network interactions support human NREM memory consolidation, as little prior work has tested evidence for hippocampal reactivation and associated network interactions in the human brain.  By combining TMS with high-density EEG and EEG-fMRI measurements of NREM brain activity, this proposal seeks to remedy these gaps by 1):  testing the causal contribution of mPFC integrity to slow wave activity generation and associated NREM sleep memory consolidation, and by 2):  testing whether hippocampal-dependent learning results in robust evidence for hippocampal reactivation and large-scale network interactions during subsequent NREM sleep, and whether NREM hippocampal activity measures are functionally predictive of memory consolidation success (memory retention and neural stabilization across hippocampal-cortical networks).  In sum, this work aims to study the underlying brain regions and neural mechanisms that critically contribute to long-term memory retention during sleep in humans.  This proposal will improve our understanding of basic memory mechanisms that may underlie memory deficits in psychiatric and neurological disease states, which often express co-morbid impairments in memory and sleep abnormalities.  Moreover, this work will elucidate the functional significance of sleep loss associated with several neurological disorders and will aid in the successful development of therapeutics to ameliorate memory deficits by targeting modifiable aspects of sleep physiology."
"9336602","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of early infant diagnosis (EID) is to identify HIV+ infants prior to the development of clinical disease to facilitate early initiation o ART and improve infant survival. Nearly 20% of Kenyan infants born to HIV+ mothers each year become infected (roughly 20,000). Without early diagnosis and ART over half of these HIV+ infants will die by the age of two years; however, early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation (before 12 weeks) can reduce the risk of mortality by 76%. In 2008 Kenyan National Policy was revised to include rapid initiation of pediatric ART to all infants confirmed HIV+ with PCR testing The current EID system, however, is hampered by significant structural barriers that contribute to late and sporadic testing of HIV exposed infants, lost or delayed test results from the laboratory, and the absence of a reliable system to notify mothers of test results or the need to return to the hospital. Consequently, only about one-third of HIV-exposed infants are retained in EID care until 18 months of age. The proposed study will evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the HIV Infant Tracking System (HITSystem(c)), an online, intervention with automated alerts designed to overcome current EID barriers by prospectively tracking HIV-exposed infants, improving the communication of PCR results from laboratories to both clinics and mothers, and supporting existing networks to facilitate quality HIV pediatric care. This robust intervention allows clinicians, lab technicians, and program managers to track the time sensitive interventions of EID and ART programs in real-time through online entries which trigger action 'alerts' when time sensitive interventions are overdue for specific infants. A builtin text messaging system sends automated text messages to mothers' cell phones when test results are ready or follow up visits are needed. The ultimate goals of the HITSystem are to increase the number of HIV-exposed infants retained in EID services (until 18 months), and facilitate early ART initiation for infants diagnosed HIV+. Promising pilot data comparing pre (n=330) and post (n=460) HITSystem intervention data at two low resource hospitals in Kenya demonstrate acceptability and feasibility of implementing the system which led to highly significant improvements in EID retention (31% pre vs. 97% post), and ART initiation rates for infants diagnosed HIV+ (44% pre vs. 95% post)."
"9212221","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in U.S. males, the death rate from this cancer is lower than would be expected. African Americans (AAs) who have prostate cancer (PCa) typically have more aggressive disease and make up a disproportionate number of the deaths from this disease; however, many patients with PCa will not die of PCa even if untreated (i.e., indolent prostate cancer). We have recently studied the expression of the molecule, Kaiso, in PCa and found that Kaiso is increased in aggressive PCa, especially in PCa in AAs. Also, we have found that Kaiso is involved in facilitating the epigenetic suppression of genes (e.g., E-cadherin), and via this silencing of specific genes, causing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and androgen resistance of PCa. The objectives of our proposal are to demonstrate that the nuclear expression of Kaiso is mediated through EGFR signaling and that Kaiso can be targeted therapeutically to reduce EMT and associated metastases of PCa. To accomplish this, we have outlined three specific aims."

"9237404","Project Summary  Cancer is a leading cause of death in the US. Research has demonstrated that poor dietary habits are a major preventable cause of cancer. Americans are burdened by suboptimal dietary intake. Improving diet is clearly a priority for reducing burdens of cancer in the US. Unfortunately, the optimal strategies to improve diet and reduce cancer are not clear. While various individual-level behavioral change approaches can be effective for some people, overall benefits and long-term adherence may be modest and overall benefits poorly sustained. In contrast, population-based strategies can be more powerful and sustainable, and achieve broader impact. We have systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence-base for effects of various population interventions on dietary intake and identified several strategies with the strongest evidence-base. However, the effectiveness of these strategies on reducing cancer burden has not been quantified. In addition, the cost for implementing these strategies is largely unknown; and the cost-effectiveness of implementing these interventions has not been established. To address these major gaps in knowledge, we have selected population-based strategies to improve specific dietary targets that have the strongest evidence for effects on cancer incidence, in the realms of (1) media/education, (2) food labeling/information, (3) taxation/subsidies, and (4) regulations/quality standards. We will develop two population-based models: (a) a Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) model; and (b) a health policy state transition Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation, the Diet Cancer Outcome Model (DiCOM), to quantify and compare the effectiveness of these interventions by estimating the numbers of cancer incidence and deaths reduced, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained in the US population, with projections over 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. Second, we will develop costing protocols to estimate the cost of implementing specific population-based dietary interventions from a societal perspective, and subsequently assess the cost- effectiveness of the interventions by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained. We will further evaluate the impact of implementing population-based dietary interventions to reduce cancer disparities in disadvantaged groups as exploratory analyses. The robustness of estimates will be assessed with extensive sensitivity analyses to varying assumptions on model parameters and assumptions. This study will provide, for the first time, the effectiveness estimates of well-defined population strategies to improve targeted dietary factors and reduce cancer burden in the US, which are crucial to informing dietary healthy policy making and evidence-based cancer prevention efforts."
"9133863","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application proposes to continue the cancer prevention programs of the University of Kentucky PRC, the only PRC dedicated to cancer prevention in rural Appalachia. Known locally as the Rural Cancer Prevention Center (RCPC), our past focus has been on the prevention (through vaccination) and early detection of cervical cancer. Through social marketing and planned outreach the RCPC has successfully leveraged the trust of rural people residing in the most economically depressed area of Appalachia (southeastern, KY). The proposed renewal offers plans to continue our community-based cancer prevention research, and to extend our programs to other regions of Appalachia, using sustainable models. Moreover, the previous research pertaining to cervical cancer prevention created a strong basis for testing a novel approach to community-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). Based on new screening technology, this approach will be effective and accessible to medically disenfranchised and under-served rural residents. The proposed plan has 5 general aims (A-E) and a specific research aim (F): A) Provide infrastructure and administrative services that support cancer prevention; B) Build community capacity and actively engage the community in partnerships for cancer prevention; C) Provide an efficient and effective communications network that ties cancer prevention activities together and disseminates health communication; D) Offer training and technical support to state and local agencies; E) Evaluate (process and outcome) all planned activities related to aims A-D; and F) Conduct an applied prevention research project that demonstrates the value of using community change agents to foster widespread adoption of annual colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), followed by navigation to colonoscopy for those screening FIT-positive, and by an intervention program that promote annual repeat use of FIT. All six aims are inter-related; however, the final aim is a highly focused set of activities that occur in two phases: 1) the programs supporting this aim will be tested in Years 1-3, and 2) to benefit other rural Appalachian states, dissemination and implementation activities will be conducted in Years 4-5. Programs to be tested in Years 1-3 include 1) a community-based intervention featuring a Diffusion of Innovations model, standard RCPC outreach methods, and academic detailing for health care providers tested using a non-equivalent comparison design; this trial will end when 500 FIT specimens have been returned in the intervention health district, 2) a social network analysis (N = 64) used to provide interim feedback regarding key characteristics of effective change agents used in the diffusion model, 3) a navigation program (based on current RCPC practices for cervical cancer) that will be applied to people testing FIT-positive (N = 60), and 4)  an internet-based program designed to foster annual repeat FIT screening tested using a randomized, controlled trial design (N = 220). Programs will be designed for optimal sustainability and dissemination/implementation potential."

However, many of the most critical circuits of the NHP brain are not accessible to precise spatial and temporal observation and manipulation because they are buried more than 6 mm below the cortical surface, beyond the reach of current imaging modalities. The objective of this project is to explore and optimize an emergent technology (wave-front shaping) that will enable recording of large neuron populations and modulation of individually identified neurons, at any depth with minimal tissue damage, using a thin multimode optical fiber. The proposed method allows the formation of arbitrary three-dimensional light patterns at the fiber tip and reconstruction of high-resolution image information flowing across the fiber. The approach utilizes recent advances in theoretical understanding of wavefront shaping and multimode fibers as well as instrumentation for spatial modulation (Digital Mirror Devices). Preliminary results by the PI's group suggest the technique with its novel innovations has the required spatiotemporal bandwidth to sample large numbers of cells. However, this imaging paradigm is still in its infancy and needs to be adapted and optimized for brain studies before it can be applied in-vivo. The proposed approach has key advantages over existing bulky micro-endoscope probes and could be easily scaled up to record from multiple brain regions by lowering multiple fibers. At the end of this project we expect to be in a unique position to transfr the technique into practice through collaborations with neuroscience labs that can drive new discoveries in awake behaving non-human primates."

"9127253","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease in which there is specific loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Current management is directed at lowering eye pressure (IOP) through the use of eye drops, laser treatment, and/or operative surgery. Although such treatment can be effective, often sufficient IOP lowering can not be safely achieved, and sometimes even with significant IOP lowering there still can be progression of optic nerve damage. In an effort to complement IOP-based therapy, efforts have been made to develop neuroprotective therapies that directly act to preserve RGC health and function. However, despite important laboratory advances, neuroprotection-based treatment approaches for glaucoma have not yet made it to the clinic. In order to help advance toward a clinically viable neuroprotective strategy, we have been pursuing a combined high content/RNAi screening approach to identify small molecule compounds and pathways whose modulation that can promote RGC health and survival. Through this work we have found that the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK, MAP3K12)) is an attractive therapeutic target, and have shown that its inhibition both in vitro and in vivo promotes RGC survival. In this application, we propose to build upon these findings to move towards development of a safe and efficacious neuroprotective drug for the treatment of glaucoma and other forms of optic nerve disease. Aim 1 will utilize a DLK conditional knockout mouse to determine whether DLK inhibition promotes RGC survival in a mouse model of glaucoma. Aim 2 will explore the possible role of a DLK analog, MAP3K13 (LZK) in RGC health and survival. Aim 3 will explore the mechanism of DLK upregulation and activity following injury. Because currently available DLK inhibitors are relatively non-specific and show significant toxicity, much of which we hypothesize to be due to off-target effects, in Aim 4 for we take a medicinal chemistry approach in an effort to develop a more selective and safer DLK inhibitor."
"9146899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clean water is one of the most basic societal needs in the world. Few situations incite more public outcry than when a community learns that their drinking water has been tainted. Two of the biggest threats to groundwater quality in the U.S. are contamination from either chlorinated solvents or petroleum. Left unattended, the size and scope of the problems associated with the release of these contaminants into the environment have only become exacerbated with time. In the past decade, significant efforts have been devoted to developing innovative remedial technologies to combat contaminated groundwater. One technology that is relatively mature is the injection of liquid oxidants into contaminated aquifers or in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO). Two roadblocks to successfully implementing ISCO treatments are when contaminants are located in low permeable layers and these finer textured zones do not readily accept liquid injections or when the aquifer is porous enough for liquid injections, but the cohesive properties of the chemical oxidant results in density-driven flow, thereby causing the oxidant to sink and not treat the desired target zone. To address both problems, AirLift Environmental and the University of Nebraska developed slow-release oxidant-paraffin candles that, when inserted into low permeable zones slowly dissolve and intercept the contaminant. To prevent the oxidant from migrating downward from the candles, pneumatic circulators were developed that aerate or release bubbles at the base of the candle and prevent the oxidant from sinking while greatly facilitating its horizontal distribution. AirLift's Phase I TTR provided proof-of-concept that oxidant candles with aeration tips could be manufactured and installed with direct-push equipment and that this technology could be used to successfully treat contaminated groundwater. The objective of Phase II is to perform numerous on-site trials so that the efficacy of the direct-push candles can be quantified under a range of hydrological conditions. Additional field testing will allow AirLift to refine product design and installation procedures."
"9301240","This project will map the neuroanatomical connections of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) in  both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, a model of healthy humans, and the neurobiological  effects elicited by electrical stimulation of the cervical sympathetic chains that innervate the  SCGs. We expect to extend our present work that suggests that the left and right SCG have different  physiological functions and that the left and right SCG talk to one another within the brain to  co-ordinate breathing and blood pressure. This work is vital because we believe that a loss of  activity of SCG input to the brain and key structures within the body is responsible for the  expression of numerous inflammatory disorders including sleep apnea and nocturnal hypertension. As  such, we are confident that the work performed in this project will form the basis of future  development of novel stimulating devices that will be implanted around the post-ganglionic nerves  emanating from the left and/or right SCG in order to specifically treat a disease process that is  normally suppressed by the SCG projection."
"9264200","PROJECT SUMMARY Worldwide, the combined syndromes of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus affect nearly 387 million individuals, with a prevalence that is expected to increase by more than 50% over the next 10 years. Inadequate insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell plays a central role in the pathophysiology of both forms of diabetes, however the pathways that lead to beta cell failure remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap has led to a paucity of clinical therapies specifically focused on restoration of beta cell health in either disease. The long-term goal of our research is to define common and overlapping pathways of beta cell dysfunction in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and to delineate the role of altered beta cell calcium homeostasis in disease pathophysiology. Calcium plays a vital role in many processes that govern beta cell function, including the production, maturation, and regulated secretion of insulin. The fidelity of these processes depends on the maintenance of calcium subcompartments and their respective transmembrane gradients, which are organized at both the cellular and organelle level. The endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and secretory granules comprise a functional module referred to as the beta cell secretory pathway, through which insulin mRNA is translated and preproinsulin protein is processed to mature insulin and packaged for exocytosis. In aggregate, these organelles also represent the largest depots of intracellular calcium. Here, we will test the hypothesis that calcium dyshomeostasis arising within this integrated secretory unit is a key determinant of impaired beta cell health in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The specific goals of this work are to: (1) elucidate a role for the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) pump in the molecular regulation of calcium in the proximal secretory pathway; (2) define a complementary yet distinct role for the secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 (SPCA1) pump within the distal secretory pathway; (3) identify how altered calcium levels within this functional module impact insulin translation, processing, and secretion; (4) dissect calcium-regulated communication between secretory pathway organelles; (5) establish a novel role for beta cell Golgi stress in diabetes pathophysiology; and (6) test genetic and pharmacologic strategies to restore secretory pathway calcium homeostasis and beta cell function.  "

"9236399","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older adults with type1 diabetes (T1D) are at high risk for hypoglycemia and its devastating consequences. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in reducing the risk for hypoglycemia in adults with T1D. However, many older adults have limited technological proficiency that could be a barrier to effective use of this technology. To address this need of older adults for additional support with the use of technology and greater caregiver involvement in their diabetes management, we have developed a tablet-based diabetes management platform (DMP) that: 1) automates data transfer from CGM and insulin delivery devices without need for patient intervention; 2) facilitates communication among patients and their circle of care givers, including family members; 3) provides on-demand diabetes education materials; and 4) incorporates a clinical decision support system (CDS) that provides dosing adjustment recommendations to the healthcare team. In aim 1, we will perform a RCT to test the efficacy of this enhanced CGM (eCGM) in older adults with T1D. Subjects will be randomized to eCGM or attention control (usual care + self-blood glucose monitoring). Endpoint analysis (primary: biochemical hypoglycemia, measured by CGM [blinded in the control group]; secondary: A1c) will be at 6 months, followed by a 6-month ?continuation phase? with reduced study staff contact to assess sustainability of any benefit. In aim 2, we will use a mixed methods approach, including semi-structured interviews of patients and their caregivers, to make an in-depth assessment of barriers and enablers to the use of diabetes technology in older adults. In aim 3, we will assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of eCGM, compared to usual care. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of physician/researchers ? Dr. Howard Wolpert (an expert in the use of technology in the care of adults with T1D), Dr. Medha Munshi (an expert in geriatric diabetes), Dr. Garry Steil (an engineer and pioneering closed-loop researcher), and Dr. Jonathan Wald (a medical informatics specialist whose research focuses on the barriers to technology adoption) ? with the complementary expertise required to advance the use of technology in older adults with T1D."
"9174850","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel form of long term synaptic depression (LTD) has been identified in the hippocampus associated with acute pharmacological increases in protein O-GlcNAc levels (O-linkage of N-acetylglucosamine to S/R residues of target proteins). Initial characterization of this LTD reveals an NMDA- and PKC-independent form of plasticity with strong evidence for postsynaptic AMPA receptor internalization at CA3-CA1 synapses mediated by direct O-GlcNAcylation of the GluA2 subunit. The current proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that the phenomenon of O-GlcNAc LTD can be applied therapeutically to neuronal hyperactivity to reduce epileptoform activity during seizures. We further hypothesize that the circuit dampening effects of increased O-GlcNAc and the synaptic LTD represent a shared expression mechanism of AMPA receptor internalization from CA1 dendrites. The small but growing list of synaptic proteins shown to undergo O- GlcNAcylation suggests that this cell signaling system plays a critical role in normal synaptic transmission and may serve further regulatory function during periods of pathological neuronal network activity. The experimental findings outlined in this proposal will serve as further characterization of the role of O-GlcNAc a CNS synapses, and examination of the protein O-GlcNAcylation as a possible therapeutic target."
"9352669","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT, 1983-1993) compared intensive therapy aimed at near normal glycemia versus conventional therapy with no specific glucose targets in 1441 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). In 1993, after a mean follow-up of 6.5 yrs, the study showed conclusively that intensive therapy reduced the risks of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy by 35-76%, and that hyperglycemia was a primary determinant of complications. We also described potential adverse effects of intensive therapy; assessed its effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, neurocognition and quality of life; and projected the lifetime health-economic impact. DCCT intensive therapy was then adopted world- wide as standard-of-care for T1DM.  The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and its Complications (EDIC, 1994-present) is the observational follow-up study of the DCCT cohort, with 95% of those surviving actively participating. Most outcomes are evaluated annually. CVD events and deaths are carefully documented and adjudicated. EDIC has notably discovered that the early beneficial effects of intensive treatment on complications have persisted for over 10 years despite the similar HbA1c levels during EDIC in the two groups, termed metabolic memory. Remarkably, former intensive therapy also greatly reduced the risk of CVD events. DCCT/EDIC collaborators have also conducted numerous ancillary studies, with separate funding, most recently including measurement of cardiac function on cardiac MRI and measurement of biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation as determinants of complications.  The overarching goals for the next 5 years are to follow at least 90% of the surviving cohort; to describe accurately the study-long effects of glycemia (HbA1c) and other established and putative risk factors on diabetes complications and the metabolic memory effects of prior DCCT intensive therapy; and to expand knowledge regarding T1DM and its complications by supporting collaborations for new research funding applications to maximally utilize the cohort, phenotypic data set, and collected biologic and genetic samples.  The specific scientific aims are to 1) evaluate effects of risk factors, biomarkers and glycemia on risk of clinical CVD; 2) assess the long-term changes in CVD risk factors; 3) describe effects of DCCT intensive versus conventional therapy on mortality; 4) evaluate risk factors for severe retinopathy/nephropathy; 5) assess effects of diurnal glycemic variation on complications; and 6) conduct eight new research projects involving new measurements and analyses."
"9169453","PROJECT SUMMARY   This proposal aims to answer a simple question: how do we feel? The transduction of physical forces into cellular biochemical signals (mechanosensation) is central to a remarkable breadth of biological processes. This includes the familiar senses of touch, hearing, balance and pain as well as myriad subconscious force sensations involved in blood pressure regulation, osmolality control, proprioception, organ function, and cellular growth and development. Dysregulation of mechanosensation is associated with disease and pathophysiology including deafness, atherosclerosis, chronic pain and cancer. Remarkably, mechanosensation is still poorly understood and an integrated description of where and how forces are sensed by cells remains elusive. The objective of this proposal is to develop new approaches for studying forces and force sensors to enable the discovery of physical, molecular and cellular principles of mechanosensation in its many physiological contexts. Novel platforms are proposed for creating (i) reporters of specific forces which will be used to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of forces a cell experiences, (ii) labeling reagents and activity probes for specific mechanosensors to reveal their cellular localizations and activities and (iii) pharmacological modulators of mechanosensors to define their roles in determining a cell's response to force. In addition to enabling the study of fundamental aspects of mechanosensation, these tools will also provide a means to evaluate the potential of targeting specific mechanosensors to improve human health and treat disease. Crucially, these approaches and tools will be widely applicable and will provide insights across the broad scope of biology in which physical forces and force sensors play important roles.   "
"9146440","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human exposure to chemical warfare nerve agents from an accident or terrorist attack would have devastating consequences. With such an occurrence, it would be the job of arriving emergency and medical treatment staff to reduce further exposure and acutely treat those who have possibly sustained contamination. Unfortunately, the medical treatments following nerve agent contact are limited and of only partial benefit. There is a great need to find compounds that can reduce brain injury that is caused by chemical nerve agent exposure. The objective of this pilot research is to evaluate the compound, 2-phosphonomethyl pentanedioic acid (2- PMPA) as a neuroprotective treatment when rats sustain an exposure to soman. Reports from other models of pre-clinical research of brain injury (impact-induced traumatic brain injury and cerebrovascular stroke) have been promising and indicate that compounds that act on the N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) neuropeptide system reduce damage. NAAG levels in the central nervous system (CNS) can be modified by 2-PMPA by inhibiting glutamate carboxypeptidases that breakdown NAAG into its constituent amino acids; aspartate and glutamate. GCP enzyme inhibition, then, elevates endogenous levels of NAAG, allowing this peptide to initiate its neuroprotective role in the CNS, and reduces the rate of glutamate production, which arises from the hydrolysis of NAAG. The hypothesis is that treatment of laboratory rats exposed to soman with 2-PMPA will 1). exhibit less seizure activity, 2). less body weight loss from soman exposure, 3). less fatality, 4). less neuropathology, and 5). improved behavioral outcome. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether the administration 2-PMPA-when given in a time frame realistic to emergency treatment in a civilian setting- improves the aforementioned outcome measures. Four aims are proposed. First, a dose response relationship to hypothesized reduction of brain injury from soman will be completed. Second, pharmacokinetic studies will determine the pharmacological profile of brain changes in 2-PMPA levels after administration, as well as how treatment affects brain levels of NAAG and the precursor, N-acetylaspartate. Third, preliminary work will be performed to understand the mechanisms of action of 2-PMPA, as mediated by the putative ligand of NAAG; metabotropic glutamate type II receptors. Fourth, longer term experiments will establish whether or not 2- PMPA treatment reduces cognitive deficits seen from chemical agent brain injury. Taken together, the relevance of the proposed research is to determine the utility of 2-PMPA for the treatment of chemical agent exposure. This research will provide basic information regarding NAAG's role in the mechanisms of action underlying the pathophysiology of chemical warfare agents and provide information regarding a novel neuroprotectant system that has not been evaluated in the context of chemical nerve agents, but that shows good promise."
"9228802","Project Summary/Abstract Youth violence is a major threat to the health and wellbeing of youths in the U.S. Our project focuses on Richmond, Virginia, a medium-sized city that is ravaged by violence and poverty. In 2014, the rate of homicide among youths was nearly four times the national average. Although prevention science has shown progress in identifying promising youth violence prevention programs that focus on the individual-, family-, or school-levels, progress on community-level interventions has been scarce. Our project involves the implementation of a community level approach employing the Communities That Care prevention system (CTC), enhanced with the Walker-Talker (WT) community outreach program (CTC PLUS). While the CTC builds and cultivates social capital through coalition building and identification and implementation of evidence-based youth violence programs, the WT model will increase community capacity and awareness to make full use of these resources. The overall goal of this project is to implement and evaluate the community-level impact of the CTC PLUS strategy within the context of a multiple-baseline design. Our specific objectives include: a) determine the effectiveness of CTC PLUS on primary youth violence outcomes (e.g., youth homicides and intentional injury rates), b) determine the extent to which CTC PLUS leads to proximal outcomes including decreased neighborhood disorganization, increased numbers of youth served by high quality, evidence-based violence prevention programs, and decreased risk and increased protective/promotive factors associated with youth violence, and c) understand the impact of CTC PLUS on aspects of neighborhood and community capacity associated with youth violence prevention. Three comparable communities will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention at different implementation starting dates. The intervention will begin in the first randomly selected community (Community A), while the other two communities (Communities B and C) serve as controls. The following year, the second randomly selected community (Community B) will begin the intervention (along with the first intervention community), while the third community serves as a control. In years 4 and 5, communities A and B will continue implementing the intervention. This design will provide adequate time (i.e., 3-4 years) for the intervention effect to emerge in Communities A and B. The third community (Community C) will receive training and technical support for implementing the intervention following the last wave of data collection in Year 5 (i.e., representing a no-intervention control community during this funding period). This randomization of multiple elements of the design (i.e., both the order in which the communities receive the intervention and the timing) strengthens this design considerably because it increases the number of possible assignments while maintaining the systematic staggering of the intervention introduction. This provides a basis for conducting parametric analyses and alternative analytic strategies that make fewer assumptions about the data. If proven effective, this innovative intervention will advance the science and practice of youth violence prevention and have significant public health implication."
"9264693","Subcortical and periventricular white matter damage is a major cause of age-related cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Although the association with small vessel disease leading to chronic ischemia is well recognized, the factors promoting white matter damage are poorly understood. Located at the borderzone between separate arterial territories and supplied by terminal arterioles, the deep white matter is highly vulnerable to hypoxia- ischemia. ApoE is a lipid transport protein enriched in brain and present in three allelic variants (?2, ?3, ?4). Homozygosity for the ?4 allele (?4/?4) is the main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, but ApoE4 carriers also have increased risk for white matter lesions in the setting of both vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. ApoE4 carriers have reduced cerebral blood flow raising the possibility that cerebrovascular factors contribute their increased propensity to white matter damage. However, it remains unclear whether ApoE4 disrupts vital cerebrovascular mechanisms that assure adequate cerebral perfusion thereby promoting white matter ischemic injury. Perivascular macrophages, bone marrow derived cells closely apposed to the outer wall of cerebral arterioles, are enriched in ApoE receptors and are a powerful source of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory mediators. Therefore, we hypothesize that ApoE4 promotes white matter damage by disrupting critical neurovascular mechanisms that assure adequate cerebral perfusion, an effect mediated by perivascular macrophages through oxidative stress and inflammation. Since TRPM2 channels are involved in macrophage activation and neurovascular dysfunction, we will also examine their role. We will test the following hypotheses: (a) ApoE4 disrupts vital homeostatic mechanisms regulating the cerebral microcirculation; (b) perivascular macrophages contribute to the dysfunction through TRPM2 channels and ApoE receptors; (c) ApoE4 exacerbates hypoxic-ischemic white matter damage, an effect mediated by perivascular macrophages. Studies are conducted in young and old mice of both sexes with targeted replacement of mouse ApoE with human ApoE3 or 4. White matter injury is produced in the corpus callosum by bilateral carotid artery stenosis. State-of-the-art approaches are used to study neurovascular regulation, including a novel 3-photon imaging method enabling us, for the first time, to simultaneously assess microvascular perfusion and damage in the white matter of the corpus callosum in vivo. These studies will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the impact of ApoE4 on white matter damage, and may unveil new therapeutic targets for a leading cause of cognitive dysfunction."
"9321719","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an attractive model for study because the responsible mutations have known biochemical consequences that underlie the pathological basis of the disorder. The opportunity to determine the sequence of imaging and biomarker changes in asymptomatic gene carriers who are destined to develop AD may reveal critical information about the pathobiological cascade that culminates in symptomatic disease. Because the clinical and pathological phenotypes of autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) appear similar to those for the far more common late-onset sporadic AD, the nature and sequence of brain changes in ADAD also may be relevant for late-onset AD. However, individuals with ADAD are few and are geographically dispersed worldwide. In its initial funding period, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN) has established an international, multicenter registry of individuals (gene carriers and noncarriers; asymptomatic and symptomatic) who are biological adult children of a parent with a known causative mutation for AD in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes in which the individuals are evaluated at entry and longitudinally thereafter with standard instruments to include the Uniform Data Set of the Alzheimer's Disease Centers, structural, functional, and amyloid imaging protocols developed by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), biological fluids (blood; CSF) in accordance with the ADNI protocols, and histopathological examination of cerebral tissue in individuals who come to autopsy also using ADNI protocols. In addition to establishing the DIAN registry, support was found for DIAN's major hypotheses examined. First, AD biomarker changes will identify MCs many years before these individuals develop symptomatic AD, thus supporting the concept of preclinical AD. Second, the initial biomarker changes in the preclinical stage of ADAD will involve Aß42, followed by changes related to neurodegeneration, followed by cognitive decline. Third, the clinical and neuropathological phenotypes of ADAD will be similar to, but not identical with, those of sporadic LOAD. Although data obtained in the initial budget period provide support for each of these hypotheses, all have yet to be confirmed with longitudinal data analyses. Hence, this application now emphasizes longitudinal data collection and analyses to truly appreciate how biomarkers change over time. This renewal application continues to address the 3 original DIAN hypotheses with increased emphasis on longitudinal data (increasing visit frequency for asymptomatic participants) and maintain current aims (maintenance of the established international DIAN registry of individuals (MCs and NCs, symptomatic and asymptomatic) with attention to preparing and adjusting for participants who participate in current and planned prevention trials. New scientific studies are planned; many funded independently of the DIAN grant and conducted within the DIAN infrastructure at no cost to DIAN."

"9085106","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will develop and evaluate a glaucoma screening program for high-risk African American and Latino men and women 50 years of age and older, and will provide a refined screening algorithm with acceptable positive and negative predictive values that can be generalized to other high-risk populations. We are collaborating with highly successful local community organizations with extensive experience in screening for disease and obtaining care for these at-risk populations. Our partners work closely with others in the community including churches, community health centers, and community clinics. Our approach is innovating in ways that will overcome obstacles to screening, referral and retention that have limited previous community- based glaucoma screening programs. Specifically, we will achieve our objectives in two phases. In the first phase (up to 18 months involving 1,000 participants), we will adapt our planned streamlined diagnostic algorithm to maximize positive and negative predictive values for glaucoma. Additionally, we will seek out low-cost approaches and will leverage technology to reduce the overall cost of the process so that the program used can be brought to scale in other regions of the United States. Throughout the program we will use multiple structural and functional visual tests (tests of visual acuity, fundus photographs, intraocular pressure measurements, and visual field testing) with on- site and centralized reading and interpretation of images. Data from the initial screening efforts will be used to improve our screening algorithm. In the second phase, we will apply the final simplified algorithm to a series of high-yield screening venues for African American and Latino adults 50 years of age and older via participation in events organized by local community associations (N = 9,000 participants). While glaucoma will be the primary aim of screening, other eye conditions (refractive error, cataract and diabetic retinopathy) will also be identified and referred. Given high rates of glaucoma in first-degree relatives, we will embed a program to pursue relatives of identified cases. We will also leverage internet and cell-phone based technologies to develop, implement, and evaluate strategies for monitoring follow-up care of screened participants. In summary, this program will not only screen a large number of individuals without access to eye care and at risk of blindness, it will also, through ongoing data collection at every stage of the process, create a scalable model for reaching these individuals across the country."
"9258107","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting one million Americans alive today. Research into the mechanisms underlying PD has been a major focus over the last 20 years; driven by genetic discoveries, work in functional and translation domains is providing insights into the processes underlying disease etiology. To maximize the potential of this work, which originates from a variety of disciplines, it is essential that a diverse group of investigators have a forum for exchange and vigorous discussion of ideas and data; furthermore it is essential that this occurs in an environment of inclusion. We will bring together investigators with diverse scientific backgrounds who share an interest in understanding the basis of PD and its related disorders, and in pursuing translational research to effect etiologic-based therapies. This meeting will pair a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and a Gordon Research Conference (GRC); these meetings will be held consecutively from June 24-June 30, 2017 at Sunday River, Maine. This will be the second PD GRC and the first PD GRS. We intend to hold these meeting biennially. The GRS is intended to enable young researchers to share in the GRC experience and will occur the weekend immediately prior to the GRC. Graduate students, post-docs, and other junior scientists will come together to discuss their current research and build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. The specific content of the GRS and GRC has evolved this year, not only to reflect our dynamic understanding of PD, but also to cover topics we were unable to address in the 2015 meeting. This meeting will address topics stretching from genetics, through mechanistic understanding, to translational potential. This meeting, by bringing together scientists with different knowledge, opinions, and technical approaches, will serve to develop new therapies for millions of patients with PD and related disorders including Lewy body diseases and other movement disorders. The enrollment for this meeting is expected to be 200, the limit at Sunday River. The NIH is being asked to help cover the registration costs for 17 early career investigators. These investigators will be chosen from the invited speakers and those with outstanding poster abstracts. The 2017 GRC and GRS are centered on a format that emphasizes discourse and unpublished results. The GRC format creates a unique opportunity for students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty. We expect that the inclusion of a GRS immediately prior to the GRC will facilitate the active participation of junior researchers. At our meetings we will prioritize participant diversity by active inclusion of women, minorities, and scientists from a variety of backgrounds, including those that work at academic and commercial institutions."
"9153186","Project Summary/Abstract  More than a third of human cerebral cortex responds to visual information, which enters cortex through primary visual cortex (V1). Accordingly, much is known about V1 processing. However, much less is known about information processing in the `next' cortical area (V2), and even less is known about higher area V3. In animal studies of V2, one key to understanding information processing is that different types of stimulus features are processed ~independently in segregated `stripes' of cortical columns. One set of columnar stripes responds selectively to variations in color, a surface property. Another set of columns responds best to variations in boundaries based on stereoscopic (`3D') stimuli (thus the latter research can clarify mechanisms underlying amblyopia). Study of such columns can reveal fundamental responses in the component neurons.  Previously, it has been unknown whether such functional stripes/columns exist in humans. Conventional functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques cannot spatially resolve such columns, which are quite small. By using a specialized fMRI approach (7T, 1 mm3), here we successfully demonstrated (and have begun analyzing) such columns and stripes in human areas V2 and V3. Beyond simply imaging such columns, we propose to test a new hypothesis: early visual cortex processes boundaries vs. surface features, in two parallel streams, within thin and thick stripes (respectively) in V2. We also test whether that surface-vs.- boundary information is then passed forward to segregated columns in V3. If confirmed, this hypothesis will clarify (and help unify) the diverse existing data about the nature of functional processing in early visual cortex.  Aim 1 will test our hypothesis by presenting different types of stimulus boundaries or surface properties, testing for correspondingly higher responses in thick or thin stripes, respectively. Each of five sub-aims will isolate and test responses to boundaries defined by differences in either: binocular disparity (sub-aim 1.1), or direction of motion (1.2), texture (1.3), color (1.4), or luminance (1.5).  Aim 2 tests the conclusions from Aim 1 in a complementary way, by presenting stimuli that include only a single boundary, in each quadrant of the visual field, and in the corresponding cortical map. Aims 3.1 and 3.2 will test for higher activity in retinotopically-predicted subregions in thick stripes (and related V3 columns) due to inferred or illusory contours. The stimulus used in aim 3.3 predicts a shift in activity between the thin vs. thick stripe systems, produced by retinotopically specific colored surfaces- vs. boundaries, respectively.  Different points in visual space (either surfaces or boundaries) are mapped onto the cortical surface, a property known as `retinotopic' mapping. Thus the columns (aim 1) co-exist with maps of retinotopy. However It is not known how these two maps accommodate each other at the spatial resolution of columns. Aim 3 will clarify whether thin vs. thick stripes (and related V3 columns) have duplicated retinotopic maps (sub-aim 3.1), or specific retinotopic `gaps' (3.2), or smaller vs. greater retinotopic spread, respectively."
"9301871","Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus. Outbreaks across Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific have been reported over the past 10 years and case reports of associated Guillain-Barré syndrome have suggested that these virus strains may have pathological effects on neural tissue. The most recent migration of Zika into South and Central America has rapidly expanded the area of virus transmission. In addition, more than 400 cases have been reported in the US since late 2015, a number that continues to increase. This rise in transmission is of critical concern since infection with ZIKV during pregnancy is thought to lead to microcephaly and ocular abnormalities. It is still unknown how prenatal ZIKV brain infection leads to morphological abnormalities in the developing brain. Here we propose a multidisciplinary study using imaging, genetic fate mapping and in vivo neurodevelopmental approaches to study development of the murine neocortex in a precise and quantitative fashion. Our recent studies demonstrate that these techniques robustly measure critical cellular and molecular processes of fetal brain growth and function. We will leverage this expertise in collaboration with virus experts to determine the consequences of ZIKV infection on the developing brain in a model of known ZIKV susceptibility. We will determine which cells are most vulnerable to ZIKV and how infection of these cells translates to abnormal brain growth and intellectual disability."
"9112472","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conflicting results exist in the literature on the effects of drugs on driving. This is a major concern as 9.9 million persons reported driving under the influence of illicit drugs in 2013. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), a census of all U.S. fatal vehicle crashes, is a source of information that could shed light into this discrepancy.  However, currently it is not possible to determine tests performed as FARS only records positive and not negative results. This gap is a major impediment to understanding the impact of drugs and driving. FARS also does not distinguish between the active THC, responsible for the acute effects of marijuana, and the inactive metabolites, which can persist for weeks. Therefore, we do not know if fatally injured drivers were under the influence of marijuana at the time of the crash or if the consumption occurred days prior the crash. These deficiencies preclude conducting studies evaluating drug involvement in crashes, trends, or the effects of drugged driving laws. Comprehensive and high quality data on fatally injured drivers exists in certain states with centralized forensic laboratories. The current structure of FARS does not utilize this information as no mechanism is in place to link these reporting systems. The long-term objective of this study is to reduce drug related traffic injuries by developing a reliable databas using toxicology data that can support valid drugged driving research. The main aim of this R21 exploratory grant is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a sentinel Drug-FARS research database to investigate important issues regarding drugs and traffic crash risk. Subsequent aims include determining the prevalence and trends in drug involvement in fatally injured drivers; and identifying potential states and counties for development of a comprehensive Drug-FARS for future research. This study is an innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable application of data linkage of medical examiner, toxicology, and FARS databases to address the public health need for data on drug use and driving. A multi-disciplinary Expert Working Group will advise on the development of a toxicology database model for traffic fatalities. Toxicology laboratory and medical examiner data from three states, Maryland, Washington, and West Virginia will be examined and data harmonized into common data elements. Linkage of toxicology data with FARS at the state level will enrich the quality data on crash circumstances and contributing factors. The database will be used to determine accurate drugged driving prevalence and trends. In-depth analyses of drugs testing in FARS will also be conducted to identify candidate states for development of a comprehensive Drug-FARS. This research will result in a research database (Sentinel Drug-FARS) that will enable researchers to determine risks related to individual drugs and driving, and to design, monitor and evaluate interventions targeting drugged driving. The fulfillment of the aims will potentially influence the core toxicoloy drug data collection and linkage methodology from the local to the national levels. This study will  also contribute to standardize the data process to facilitate comparison across states and time."
"9152998","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and metastatic form of breast cancer that is characterized by a lack of the estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptor, which renders it resistant to targeted and hormone therapies. TNBC patients tend to be young, thus, the need to develop effective targeted therapies for this subgroup of patients is particularly urgent. The molecular basis for the high metastatic potential of TNBC is unknown. TNBC expresses high levels of a metastasis-inducing protein, CUB-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1), which has been correlated with the aggressive nature of many forms of cancer, including TNBC.  CDCP1 can be proteolytically processed from a full-length, 135 kDa (flCDCP1), to a cleaved, 70 kDa (cCDCP1), isoform by trypsin, matriptase, and plasmin. Recent reports have highlighted the unique signaling cascades induced by 70 kDa cCDCP1, which include degradation of adherens junctions, evasion of PARP1 mediated apoptosis, and enhancement of PKC?, Akt, and FAK signaling. Furthermore, we and others have observed that CDCP1 exists mostly in the cleaved state in multiple TNBC cell lines.  Our lab and others have shown that CDCP1 is phosphorylated by Src family kinase (SFKs), which stimulates the recruitment of PKC? to the CDCP1/SFK complex, resulting in PKC? phosphorylation. PKC? activation results in migration of cells in vitro. It is not clear if phosphorylation and cleavage are the only steps in activation of CDCP1 and its downstream signaling. The objective of this project is to dissect the mechanism of CDCP1 activation and determine a strategy to block it and inhibit CDCP1-induced migration.  My recent work in HEK 293T cells shows a dramatic increase PKC?, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation in cCDCP1 transfected HEK 293T cells, as opposed to flCDCP1 transfected cells. These findings support the necessity of CDCP1 cleavage for its activation. Furthermore, I found that only cCDCP1 can form a dimer, which we propose to occur through its CUB domains known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. The importance for this dimer in CDCP1 pro-migratory signaling remains to be investigated.  These studies aim to determine the role of the CDCP1 dimer in CDCP1-mediated metastasis. I propose that inhibiting CDCP1 dimerization is a rationale therapeutic to inhibit CDCP1-mediated metastasis as some current FDA approved anti-cancer therapies inhibit dimerization of their respective targets; Herceptin, Pertuzumab, and Cetuximab."
"9247587","Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced ?connectome-quality? multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for ?pre-?diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general."

We propose to do this through three specific aims, as follows: Specific Aim 1: To maintain, expand, and refine the Gastroparesis Registry in order to enable critical additional and new analyses of the clinical data and biosamples. Specific Aim 2: To conduct a randomized controlled trial of aprepitant in patients with gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia-postprandial distress syndrome.

"9146903","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1 Slip and fall accidents are a major and growing source of occupational injuries. Shoes that are heavily worn 2 have reduced coefficient of friction (COF) and are associated with increased slipping risk. The mechanism 3 causing this loss of friction is that worn tread can no longer channel fluids from beneath the shoe, which causes 4 the fluid to become pressurized, the COF to decrease and the slip risk to increase. Key knowledge gaps exist 5 regarding the factors that contribute to shoe wear rate and the wear thresholds at which COF begins to 6 decrease. This gap inhibits selection of wear-resistant shoes and programs that replace shoes before they 7 become too worn. The overall objective of this R01 study is to fill this gap by identifying the underlying 8 causes to shoe wear and identifying the tread thresholds where shoes become unsafe. The proposed research  9 will accomplish this goal with: 1) experiments that identify the factors that contribute to wear rate (Aim 1) and 10 replacement thresholds for worn shoes (Aim 2); 2) a computational model that predicts wear rate and the life 11 expectancy of shoes (Aim 3); 3) a validation of Aims 1 and 3 based on tracking wear in occupational settings 12 (Aim 4); and 4) a validation of Aim 2 based on unexpected slips of participants donning naturally worn shoes 13 (Aim 5). To accomplish Aims 1 and 2, a shoe wear tester will reproduce the kinetics of stepping repeatedly to 14 accelerate the wear of the shoe tread. For Aim 1, the effects of shoe material and tread design on tread wear 15 rate will be quantified. For Aim 2, the impact of wear on COF and under-shoe fluid pressures will be 16 determined and tread thresholds where fluid pressures start to significantly increase will be identified. The 17 impact of fluid pressures on COF will be tested. For Aim 3, an iterative FEA model will be developed that 18 calculates wear based on the contact pressures and then updates the shoe geometry based on the calculated 19 wear. For Aim 4, two cohorts of twenty participants (one from Nabors Industries and one cohort from general 20 industry) will wear two different shoe designs. Shoe wear and number of steps will be tracked to validate the 21 degree to which the wear rates observed in the experiments (Aim 1) and the model (Aim 3) reflect actual wear 22 experienced in industry. For Aim 5, sixty individuals will be unexpectedly slipped while wearing naturally 23 worn shoes. This aim will validate the effect of shoes worn beyond their replacement limits (determined in Aim 24 2) on slip risk. This proposal will meet NIOSH's Research to Practice (R2P) initiative by identifying the 25 factors that affect the life of shoes and their replacement limits, which will be translated to practice through 26 industry partners, publications and training programs. The outputs of this research will be new knowledge on 27 when worn shoes should be replaced, what factors influence wear, and a computational model of shoe wear. 28 The outcomes will be improved shoe design and replacement policies that lead to a reduction in slip and fall 29 accidents from worn shoes. This research will address NORA Strategic Goals for Manufacturing (Goal 2), 30 Wholesale and Retail Trade (Goal 2) and Oil and Gas Extraction (Goal 4.2)."
"9313429","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) hold great promise in regenerative medicine for the treatment of chronic or currently incurable cardiovascular diseases. The homing of EPCs to neovascular areas requires a coordinated sequence of multistep events, including chemoattraction, adhesion, and invasion, before differentiation into mature endothelial cells and incorporation into active neovasculature. Impaired EPC function in mobilization and homing affects vascular homeostasis and also compensatory angiogenesis. Circulating EPCs may thus provide an endogenous repair mechanism to counteract ongoing risk factor-induced endothelial injury and to replace dysfunctional endothelium. Members of the SMYD protein family represent an emerging group of lysine methyltransferases that are particularly abundant in the cytoplasm, with SMYD1 being most highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. SMYD1 knockout in mice results in early embryonic lethality due to disruption of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. It has been reported that the chemokine receptor CXCR2 and its cognate ligands mediate EPC recruitment and angiogenesis in endothelial injury and myocardial ischemia. Compared with what is known about CXCR2 phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications (such as ubiquitination and glycosylation), nothing is known about the lysine methylation of CXCR2, and how CXCR2 methylation might influence CXCR2 activation and signaling, especially as involved in EPC biology. The long-term goal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating EPC homing and angiogenesis, in the hope of revealing novel therapeutic targets for certain vascular diseases. The hypothesis of this application is that lysine methylation of CXCR2 by the histone methyltransferase SMYD1 regulates EPC homing and angiogenesis through modulating CXCR2 activation and signaling. The specific aims of this project are: first, to examine the effect of SMYD1 in modulating CXCR2- mediated EPC migratory and angiogenic activities; and second, to characterize the molecular mechanism by which SMYD1 regulates CXCR2-mediated EPC function. A combination of multiple approaches, i.e., molecular and biochemical techniques, cellular functional assays, and in vivo animal models, will be used to test the hypothesis. The proposed research is innovative because by exploring a previously unrecognized lysine methylation of CXCR2 in modulating EPC functions, new potential therapeutic paradigms may evolve for EPC- based cell therapy in aberrant angiogenesis. In addition, this is the first study to investigate methylation of CXCR2 that may be the first non-histone target/substrate of the histone lysine methyltransferase SMYD1. The anticipated results from this proposal are the identification of a yet-unexplored role of the lysine methyltransferase SMYD1 in regulating CXCR2 function and the establishment of a novel link between lysine methylation, chemokine receptor activation, and endothelial signaling during vascular development and injury. Such results are expected to have an important impact in EPC biology, because the mechanistic characterization of the SMYD1-catalyzed CXCR2 lysine methylation are likely to provide valuable information for enhancing EPC-based cell therapy for certain vascular diseases, as well as to fundamentally advance the field of chemokine receptor biology."

"9122654","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project seeks to deliver unprecedented speed and imaging performance to low-field MRI to demonstrate that low-cost, lightweight implementations of MRI can be developed to allow robust, transportable imaging well suited to diagnose time-sensitive injuries such as head trauma and stroke. Current experimental mobile-sized systems are far too slow and low-resolution for such real-world applications. By innovating upon an already state of the art low-field 6.5 mT MR imaging system through a series of advanced hardware upgrades and pulse sequence optimizations, we expect to achieve 30-fold improvement in imaging speed and thus acquire moderately high-resolution 3D image datasets in about 10 seconds. Our specific aims are 1) to optimize the design of and install the upgraded gradient hardware, which would provide greater flexibility push our pulse sequences to far higher speeds, and 2) to validate the clinical utility of the optimized system in normal and Traumatic Brain Injury patients and evaluate the low-field system in comparison with gold standard 3T scanning, which will enable us to further optimize our low-field sequences. The technical advances of this low-field project, which are more efficiently developed within an existing larger test-bed system, will be readily translatable into future miniaturized MR systems."
"9322703","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SORT1 blocking antibodies for Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia Alector's objective is to develop therapeutic antibodies against the receptor Sortilin1 (SORT1) for the treatment of the devastating neurological disorders Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). FTD is a progressive disease that causes incapacitating changes in behavior, language, movement and cognition, and is the most common of the pre-senile dementias, affecting ~50,000-60,000 people in the US. AD is the most common cause of dementia, which shares many pathological and phenotypic features with FTD. As AD affects an estimated 5M Americans, with the numbers increasing steadily, the disease represents a major public health issue. There is no effective treatment for FTD, which is typically diagnosed 3-4 years after symptom onset, with a median survival of 6-11 years. Furthermore, there are no available treatments that halt progression of AD. Ultimately, patients with FTD or AD will require round-the-clock medical care. Progranulin (PGRN) is a neurotrophin that has been identified as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. PGRN haploinsufficiency is causal for 10% of all FTD cases, while other alleles are associated with the development of late onset AD. SORT1 is a transmembrane receptor that controls the extracellular level of PGRN by binding it at the cell surface and rapidly internalizing it for lysosomal degradation, while it is dispensable for PGRN signaling. We propose to generate a therapeutic that can elevate extracellular levels of PGRN by developing antibodies that bind SORT1, block the interaction with PGRN, and thus functionally elevate PGRN levels in vitro and in vivo. Effective lead antibodies will be optimized for affinity and other characteristics and advanced for confirmatory and preclinical testing as development candidates. Both the dataset and SORT1 antibodies produced in this project would allow us to secure the additional funds necessary for advancing the candidate to preclinical testing, to IND submission, and to the clinic. Trials with a SORT1 antibody in patients with PGRN mutations would conclusively determine whether therapeutic PGRN elevation could provide meaningful clinical benefit in FTD and AD patients as hypothesized."
"9353539","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our analysis of gene expression changes during Drosophila aging reveals down- regulation of mitochondrial genes and induction of innate immune response, oxidative stress response, and proteotoxicity response. We will test the hypothesis that sexual differentiation inhibits mitochondrial turnover, and this synergizes with mitochondrial mutations to cause an accumulation of abnormal mitochondria that promote the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), inflammation and aging. We test conserved genes including p53, the dosage compensation (DC) machinery, and dopamine signaling. The methods include florescent transgenic reporter constructs, high-throughput sequencing of mitochondrial genomes and cell transcriptomes, 3D video tracking of fly gene expression and behavior, and testing conserved genes and small molecules for ability to increase life span and reduce inflammation. AIM 1 investigates mechanisms for the trade-off between reproduction and life span, including the DC machinery, p53 and small molecules. AIM 2 addresses mechanisms for cell-specific patterns of aging in oenocytes (liver-like cells), including the UPRmt, MnSOD and mitochondrial mutations. These studies may yield a model system for disease-causing mitochondrial heteroplasmy and mutations in humans. AIM 3 tests possible mechanisms for sex-specific effects of p53 on life span, including autophagy. If successful this research may identify mechanisms for mitochondrial maintenance failure during aging that are (partly) conserved with humans, and may identify promising genetic targets and drugs for sex- specific interventions in human inflammation and aging-related disease."
"9218626","Project Summary Diabetic stroke patients have higher mortality and worse neurological outcomes. Emerging clinical and experimental data suggest that BBB disruption, neuroinflammation, and stroke recovery impairment are exacerbated in T2D. Hence, the goal of this project is to investigate therapeutic approaches that can target these specific T2D mechanisms in stroke. Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF21) is a circulating endocrine hormone that is primarily expressed in the liver. FGF21 has pleiotropic metabolic actions, but also has tissue protective and repair roles. Here, we will test the overall hypothesis that exogenous recombinant human FGF21 (rFGF21) activates FGFR1-?-klotho complex that may ameliorate T2D-affected mechanisms after stroke via: (1) activation of PPAR? for BBB protection, (2) inhibition of NF?B-mediated but activation of PPAR? for neuroinflammation modulation, (3) promotion of AMPK/Nrf2-mediated vascular/white matter remodeling to boost neurorestoration after stroke. Aim 1. Investigate rFGF21 effects on blood-brain barrier integrity in T2D stroke mice. We will examine FGF21 specific receptor FGFR1 phosphorylation, PPAR? activity, BBB integrity, hemorrhagic transformation, expression of vascular inflammatory molecules and tight junction proteins, are assessed up to 3 days after stroke (dMCAO) in db/db T2D mice, and T2D stroke in vitro model of brain endothelial/astrocytes co-cultures. Aim 2. Investigate rFGF21 effects on neuroinflammation in T2D stroke. We will examine NF?B and PPAR? activation, and correlation with microglia/macrophage activation, pro-inflammatory factor expression in peri- lesion area by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blots, and flow cytometry after focal dMCAO stroke in T2D mice, and in primary microglia cultures in vitro. Aim 3. Investigate rFGF21 effects on vascular/white matter remodeling in T2D stroke. We will examine activation of AMPK and Nrf2, expression of trophic factors in isolated brain microvascular fragments and brain tissues by western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA microarray. We will also test biomarkers of vascular and white matter remodeling over time by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and western blots after ischemic stroke of T2D mice, and in vitro models of primary human brain endothelial cultures and oligodendrocyte cultures."
"9168259","Project Summary/Abstract Membrane proteins are embedded in the biological membrane where they function and intimately interact with lipid molecules. The environment of the biological membrane is dynamic and composed of a rich chemical diversity of lipid molecules. Alongside the complexity of the biological membrane is the growing realization of the important roles of lipid molecules in the folding, structure, and function of membrane proteins. In particular, inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels have central roles in regulating membrane potential and potassium homeostasis. It has been known for nearly 20 years that these channels require a specific lipid for function. Although many studies have provided insight into Kir channel structure and function, there remain a number of fundamental questions: What determines the selectivity of Kir channels towards lipids? What are the thermodynamic binding parameters for individual lipid binding events to Kir channels? Do lipids bind cooperatively to Kir channels? Does Kir channel conformation (open or closed) influence the selectivity towards individual lipids? How many specific lipids are required to gate Kir channels? What are the thermodynamic stabilities of Kir channel open and closed states when bound to one, two, three, or four specific lipids? Here, we propose to address these fundamental questions using native ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) technology, whereby non-covalent interactions are preserved in the mass spectrometer and capitalize on IM-MS approaches we have pioneered that, unlike other biophysical methods, allow us to resolve and interrogate individual lipid binding events to membrane protein complexes. We seek to apply novel and highly innovative IM-MS approaches that we have recently developed to deduce thermodynamic binding parameters for individual lipid binding events to membrane proteins. Moreover, we propose to investigate Kir channel gating using IM-MS that will allow us for the first time to monitor the conformational states (open and closed) for apo and lipid bound states. Our proposal will also investigate the allosteric regulation of Kir channels by lipids and other molecules using new IM-MS methods we have recently developed to resolve and interrogate heterogeneous lipid binding events at the resolution of individual lipids. Taken together, we anticipate the results from our proposed studies to provide fundamental insight into how lipids and other molecules modulate the structure and function of Kir channels."
"9163042","The overarching theme of this long-standing project is both a comprehensive and in depth understanding of the biology of arsenic, the most pervasive environmental toxic substance and carcinogen in nature. The Environmental Protection Agency calls arsenic the most prevalent environmental toxin and carcinogen in the United States (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/cercla/07list.html). Arsenic causes cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus and various forms of cancer such as skin and bladder cancer. We have described steps in the biogeocycle for inorganic arsenic and identified a parallel biocycle for organoarsenicals. We hypothesize that members of microbial communities synthesize methylarsenite (MAs(III)) by methylation of inorganic arsenite (As(III)) and use this extremely toxic organoarsenical as an antibiotic against other bacteria. Man has created even more toxic synthetic organoarsenicals for use as herbicides and antimicrobial growth promoters. In response to environmental pressures, bacteria evolved resistance mechanisms against both biological and synthetic toxic organoarsenicals. Our overall goal is to characterize the pathway of arsenic methylation and detoxification at the functional, mechanistic and structural levels. We propose three specific aims: 1) synthesis of MAs(III), 2) breakdown of MAs(III) and 3) efflux of MAs(III). We unify these physiological functions in a new and novel hypothesis on the evolution of antibiotics."

"8998777","The first report showing a protective effect of cytomegalovirus (CMV) against cancer relapse was published  nearly 20 years ago, and this effect has been confirmed in several independent studies, including a large-scale  clinical analysis of >2,500 patients with hematologic malignancies. While the protective effect of CMV is  presumed to be due to a unique priming of the immune system, the mechanism of this priming is unknown. We  are in a new era where the power of the immune response against cancer is just being realized. We have  recently discovered oligoclonal expansions of highly differentiated NK cells expressing the activating receptor  NKG2C in individuals having past infection with CMV. These NKG2C+ NK cells have an educated phenotype,  as they are enriched for the expression of self HLA-C-specific inhibitory KIRs and appear to represent the  human equivalent of ?memory? or ?adaptive? NK cells described in CMV-infected mice. Published work by our  group has shown that these NKG2C+ NK cells display heightened effector functions, expand in transplant  patients in response to reactivation of latent CMV and persist for at least one year post-transplant. They are  transplantable from a CMV seropositive donor and expand in a seropositive recipient. We have extensive  preliminary data showing that NKG2C is not the only marker for CMV-induced adaptive NK cells. We identified  expansions of NK cells selectively lacking the proximal signaling molecules Fc?R1?, EAT-2 and SYK  individually or in combination specifically in CMV seropositive blood donors and in transplant recipients that  reactivated CMV. These cells are epigenetically primed for enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and  survival and are functionally specialized for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through CD16. We  will translate this research into methods to prime NK cells ex vivo or in vivo with potent function and prolonged  in vivo survival for clinical use in patients with leukemia. We will test the hypothesis that the expansion of CMV-  induced adaptive NK cells is associated with reduced cancer relapse by performing a high-resolution analysis  of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells in our well-defined transplant cohorts and correlating this analysis with  clinical outcomes. We will also test the hypothesis that STAT3 signaling and CD16 receptor engagement  drives the expansion of adaptive NK cells both in vitro and using our bank of clinical samples. Finally, we will  use our xenogeneic adoptive NK cell transfer model to test the anti-tumor effect of CMV-induced adaptive NK  cells in vivo. The concept of CMV induced adaptive NK cells is new and little is know about these cells in  humans. We have already discovered how to identify adaptive NK cell and we have clinical samples collected  based on CMV reactivation. We are optimally positioned to definitively answer the question about whether  adaptive NK cells can prevent relapse as our preliminary data suggests or treat cancer."

Research areas represented by SGTP faculty include: broad areas of genomics and computational biology, genome characterization, medical genomics, technology development, comparative genomics, diversity and variation, developmental genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, gene regulation and systems biology, all with an omics emphasis. Our models of organisms studied include: yeast, flies, worms, fish, mice, humans, and other primates (chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans). An interdisciplinary curriculum and frequent opportunities for exchange of resources and knowledge within and beyond the Stanford campus is also provided. Overall, the SGTP provides robust training for fellows. This R25 application aims to enhance the successful training efforts of the SGTP by exposing and fostering summer research opportunities for diverse undergraduate populations. This effort to expand diversity has been coined by the NHGRI as the Diversity Action Plan (DAP). Stanfords DAP being proposed in this R25 resubmission will help participants of diverse backgrounds to: (a) be exposed to genetics and genomics; (b) acquire research experience; and (c) prepare for applying to a PhD in genetics or genomics. This will be achieved by providing a 9 week summer research program for underrepresented populations. Participants will conduct research for 40 hours per week in an SGTP lab and receive workshops and individual assistance as it relates understanding genetics/genomics and increasing career, academic, and personal skills necessary for pursuit of a PhD. By focusing on preparing undergraduates, we aim to increase and better prepare students of diverse backgrounds for pursuit of a PhD in genetics and genomics."
"9110898","DESCRIPTION:     According to the model of person-environment fit (P-E fit), older adults are at risk for poor outcomes when the demands and resources available in the environment are no longer in balance with the individual's everyday competence (the ability to solve problems associated with everyday life). It has been estimated that 29% of Community Living Center (CLC; VA nursing homes) residents may not require nursing home levels of care and could safely reside in the community with appropriate rehabilitative services. In VA, a major focus is to minimize time in CLCs by providing rehabilitation and transitioning Veterans to the community. CLC staff and Veterans face barriers to facilitating these transitions (e.g., caregiving needs, housing, etc.). N standardized process exists to assure that treatment planning includes processes to maximize P-E fit. The objective of this study is to develop a toolkit the CLC interdisciplinary team can use to 1) assess the Veteran's everyday competence; 2) develop personally meaningful rehabilitation goals based on everyday competence; and 3) conduct structured treatment planning to support resident goals around transitions back into the community. Acknowledging that even the most effective intervention is worthless if no one actually uses it, we propose a three-phase research process: Understand ? Develop ? Trial. Phase 1 (Understand) focuses on gaining an understanding of the current environment, discharge planning processes, and outcomes in CLCs. In Aim 1a, we will use administrative data to examine outcomes and predictors of successful/unsuccessful transitions among CLC residents. Aim 1b employs qualitative interviews, to understand the current barriers and facilitators to transitioning CLC residents, identify everyday scenarios residents face, and collect staff suggestions for appropriate goal-setting domains. For Aim 1c, we will use field observation to understand the workflow, relationships, and interactions between members of the interdisciplinary team during transition planning. Phase 2 (Develop) will use information gathered in Phase 1 to develop the Everyday Competence Assessment and Planning for Community Transitions (ECAP-CT) toolkit components, including rehabilitation goal-setting domains and creation of a structured manual to guide the CLC interdisciplinary team through the assessment, goal-setting, and treatment planning steps. Phase 3 (Trial) will be a quasi-experimental effectiveness trial of the ECAP-CT toolkit in the Houston (n=30 residents) and Tuscaloosa (n=30 residents) VA CLCs. The toolkit will be implemented sequentially in the two sites allowing for adaptation. Our primary outcome is transition outcome (successful/not successful), which will be compared to concurrent administrative data gathered from two matched comparison sites (n=60). We will conduct an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis of the toolkit compared to usual care within the context of this trial. The PI's overall career aim is to become an independent rehabilitation researcher with expertise in developing and testing interventions targeting the needs of CLC residents, maximizing autonomy, independence, and function. Long-term, her career goals include developing strategies for assessment of everyday competence among CLC residents, setting resident-directed goals, and developing care plans to transition Veterans back into the community. The CDA-2 mentoring team includes established VA researchers with expertise in vulnerable older adults, assessing everyday competence, intervention development and evaluation, and long- term care transitions. With the guidance of the mentoring team, areas that would benefit from additional training have been identified The training aims outlined in this CDA-2 award will provide additional experience in these areas: 1) evaluation of patient-centered interventions, including cost-effectiveness and psychometrics methodology; 2) intervention development; 3) experience and knowledge of VA rehabilitation services; and 4) submission of a RR&D Merit Review Award. These objectives will be achieved through mentoring and attending seminars, formal courses, and conferences."
"9244090","PROJECT SUMMARY Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson?s disease (PD) results in unpredictable episodes of gait cessation, which may lead to falls, injury, a loss of independent living, and even death19. The treatment of FOG is inconsistent with either dopaminergic medication or with current open loop, continuous high frequency deep brain stimulation (cDBS)15, 25. Emerging technology using non-continuous, closed loop or adaptive DBS (aDBS), has the potential to improve treatment for FOG. Adaptive DBS can sense patient specific neural and/or kinematic signals and respond by adjusting DBS parameters to provide more efficacious therapy while reducing adverse side effects known to occur with cDBS. The critical barriers of using aDBS for FOG are the lack of knowledge of: the neural features of FOG that could be ?sensed? by aDBS to trigger stimulation, the optimal, patient specific DBS parameters for the treatment of FOG, and whether aDBS for FOG is safe and tolerable in human PD patients. In the Bronte-Stewart Lab, we have the technology, the regulatory approvals and the research experience collecting synchronized neural and quantitative kinematic signals, applying different DBS parameters for FOG, performing the first aDBS experiments in freely moving PD subjects. The Bronte-Stewart Lab was the first group and Stanford was the first site in the United States to implant a sensing neurostimulator for PD, the Activa® PC+S (Medtronic Inc., FDA IDE/Stanford IRB approval, October 2013). This comprised the FDA approved neurostimulator (Activa PC®, Medtronic Inc.) with additional software that enabled recording of brain signals via telemetry from the neurostimulator itself. We have implanted twenty PD patients (largest cohort in the world), from whom we have been collecting synchronized neural and computerized kinematic signals for over thirty months without adverse events. We will use this new technology in conjunction with our expertise in quantitative kinematics and validated measure of FOG to begin understanding the neural features associated with FOG. In addition, we will use quantitative measures of FOG to accurately determine the efficacy of patient specific stimulation parameters for effective and consistent treatment of FOG. No center has had the technological capability to test the safety and feasibility of aDBS for FOG in freely moving PD patients. Whether patients can tolerate aDBS, which continually adjusts output to control a time-varying patient-specific neural signal as they are walking and moving freely is completely unknown and will be assessed in a pilot study in this proposal. This project is expected to signal the beginning of a new era of precise medicine: the possibility to treat FOG in PD in a customized, adaptive manner, while minimizing adverse effects and complementing the treatment of other disabling motor features of PD such as tremor."

"9166825","PROJECT SUMMARY  RNA nanotechnology has progressed rapidly during the past several years. This nanotechnology includes the integration of multiple functional modules into one nanoparticle, of which the scaffolds, ligands, therapeutics, and regulators can be composed mainly or exclusively of RNA. We have constructed RNA nanoparticles of diverse size, shape, and stoichiometry displaying high chemical and thermodynamic stability and demonstrated their ability to harbor different functional groups, such as siRNA, miRNA, ribozyme, drug, and cancer targeting RNA aptamer. All functional modules retain their authentic folding and independent functionalities for specific cell binding, gene silencing, and cancer targeting in vivo. Upon systemic injection in tumor bearing mice, RNA nanoparticles bind to xenograft and metastatic tumors specifically and strongly with little to no accumulation in healthy vital organs and tissues 3-4 hours post-administration. The RNA nanoparticles are non-toxic and display favorable biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles.  Our long-term goal is to promote RNA nanoparticles as a new generation of drug for the treatment of cancers in the clinic. The short-term goal of this project is to characterize the behavior of RNA nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo, with an aim to improve the efficiency for specific cell targeting, internalization and intracellular trafficking, favorable biodistribution without entrapment in liver, endosome escape, and tumor regression. These studies are based on three central hypotheses: (1) intracellular trafficking pathways and endosome escape are critical for effective cancer therapy; (2) biodistribution and pharmacological profiles of RNA nanoparticles are shape and size dependent; and, (3) immune responses elicited by RNA nanoparticles are highly dependent on RNA sequence, chemical modifications, size, shape, and stoichiometry. To address our goals, we will (1) systemically dissect the intracellular pathways taken by RNA nanoparticles and enhance their endosome escape capabilities; (2) inspect the pharmacokinetics (PK); pharmacodynamics (PD); and biodistribution of RNA nanoparticles with the goal of enhancing cancer targeting with minimal accumulation in healthy organs; and, (3) evaluate the immune responses of RNA nanoparticles to minimize non-specific side effects, as well as develop methods to stimulate the immune system by incorporating immuno-stimulatory modules to RNA nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Upon completion of these pre-clinical studies, we will have identified several RNA nanoparticles with optimized shape, size, and stoichiometry displaying favorable safety profiles and high therapeutic efficacy to comply with FDA Investigational New Drug guidelines for initiating clinical trials."
"9236054","ABSTRACT Developing countries accounted for 45% of new breast cancer cases globally in 2009, and 57% in 2012, with these proportions projected to increase to 70% by 2030. Nigeria has experienced a three-fold increase in breast cancer incidence between 1973 and 2012, coinciding with an increase in the prevalence of so-called `diseases of affluence' including obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, a cluster of biochemical abnormalities that constitute Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Recent studies in the US and Europe have shown a consistent positive association between MetS and breast cancer risk, suggesting that rising breast cancer rates in Nigeria may be a biological consequence of increasing rates of MetS. Once diagnosed with breast cancer, Nigerian women, similar to other women of African descent, are also more likely to present at younger ages, with highly aggressive, hormone-receptor negative tumors, associated with higher mortality. The reason for a higher prevalence of these tumor types in women of African descent is unclear. Epigenetic changes, through DNA methylation, histone modification and micro RNA changes are critical aspects of breast cancer tumorigenesis, and are influenced by both genetic background and environmental exposures. Multiple US studies have observed significant differences in DNA methylation levels of critical breast cancer genes between African- Americans and whites, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, CYP1A1, H-ras-1, and Cyclin D1. DNA methylation levels in critical breast cancer genes among Nigerian women have never been examined, and this may be the key to understanding racial differences in breast cancer phenotypes. Identification of race-specific epigenetic patterns could potentially be used as an intermediary marker of the association between exposures such as MetS and breast cancer incidence, or as prognostic markers for clinical management and therapeutic interventions. Using a sample of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases and age-matched healthy controls, this study aims to examine the association between MetS and breast cancer overall, and by sub-type in Nigeria. In addition, we plan to identify genome-wide DNA methylation differences between breast cancer tumor and adjacent normal tissue among women with and without MetS. These findings will provide critical information on the influence of MetS on breast cancer in Nigeria, and improve our understanding of the specific epigenetic changes that occur with breast cancer in Nigerian women; this is likely to be different from epigenetic changes observed among African American women with significantly different environmental exposures."
"9175941","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The first neuroanatomical sex difference in mammals was reported in 1978, and named the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) due to its larger size in males compared to females. The SDN is located within the preoptic area (POA), a region critical to copulatory and maternal behaviors. Studies of these differences in SDN volume have established that males and females generate the same number of neurons in this brain region early in development. However, the lack of estradiol in females causes neurons in the SDN to selectively die off early in life, whereas the production of estradiol from precursor androgens in males exerts a neuroprotective effect. A mechanistic explanation for the neuroprotective effects of estradiol in this system is currently unknown. Recent discoveries on the critical role of non-neuronal cells, such as microglia, in sculpting the developing brain have led us to explore the role of these cells in development of sex differences in neuronal architecture. Our lab has demonstrated that microglia are essential for the masculinization of spine density on dendrites of POA neurons, as well as male copulatory behavior. I recently discovered that the female POA contains a higher percentage of surveying phagocytic microglia than the male POA. I speculate that robust volumetric sex differences in the SDN are achieved by this higher percentage of phagocytic microglia in the female SDN. Current evidence suggests that microglia play a crucial role in phagoptosis (engulfment of stressed, but viable cells) as well as phagocytosis (engulfment of dead cells) during development. This notion, coupled with the known role of estradiol in this system, has led me to predict that estradiol suppresses microglial phagoptosis in the male SDN, rather than preventing conventional neuron-initiated apoptosis. We anticipate that microglia are the initiators of the apoptotic events in females, where there is an absence of estradiol. We have proposed the following aims to test this hypothesis: 1.1) Identify the critical period for microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN. 1.2) Determine the impact of estradiol on microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN 2.1) Determine the cellular targets of microglial phagocytosis in the developing SDN and 2.2) Determine the role of microglia (phagoptosis versus conventional phagocytosis) in establishing the sex difference in size of the SDN. Completion of the experiments proposed will challenge the dogma that estradiol prevents neuronal apoptosis in the male SDN; and reveal novel hormone and neuroimmune mechanisms that regulate apoptotic and neuroprotective cascades during normal brain development. Understanding these mechanisms will not only facilitate studies of sex differences in other brain regions, but may also lead to novel insights into windows of vulnerability during development. è?More specifically, perinatal hypoxic events are more frequently associated with an increased risk of brain damage in males compared to females. The results of the proposed studies will provide new information on the neuroprotective roles of immune cells and hormones, and potential sex differences in efficacy of estradiol and/or microglial inhibitors as neuroprotective agents."
"9214258","PROJECT SUMMARY Dysregulation of the cerebral cortex is central to human developmental disorders such as epilepsy, mental deficiency, autism and schizophrenia. During development, cortical progenitors generate the projection neurons of the different cortical subdivisions. Understanding the genetic circuitry controlling the development and function of these neurons provides an essential foundation for interpreting human allele variants that are enriched in people who have neuropsychiatric disorders. To elucidate this genetic circuitry, we must define the transcription factors (TF), and regulatory elements and of the coding regions that they control. The proposed research, which concentrates on cortical regionalization, involves the systematic identification of TFs, and the regulatory elements and genes downstream of TFs. Currently, the regional-specification functions of a few TFs in embryonic cortical progenitors are known, and little is known about their direct transcription targets, the nature of the regulatory elements that these TFs control, and the transcriptional circuitry that integrates development and function of these cells. Here we propose to make inroads into each of these components of the TF hierarchy regulating cortical development. Furthermore, we aim to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms through which patterning of cortical progenitors is transmitted to, and maintained in, cortical neurons. We hypothesize that enhancers active in the ventricular zone, subventricular zone and the cortical plate are differentially bound by TFs that drive expression of region/layer-specific genes in post-mitotic cortical neurons. The enhancers serve as protein-binding modules that translate rostrocaudal gradients of TFs in cortical progenitors into region-specific expression in cortical neurons. Herein we focus on the transcriptional mechanisms controlling the generation of different regions of the cerebral cortex (cortical regionalization). The Five Specific Aims extend upon our earlier work on regionalization of cortical progenitors by FGF-signaling, TFs and enhancer elements. Here we investigate transcriptional regulation of cortical patterning by defining the TFs, and other genes, that are regulated by COUPTF1, EMX2, and PAX6 (Aim 1). We then use chromatin immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to define the regulatory element (RE) and gene targets of COUPTF1, EMX2, and PAX6 (Aim 2). Next, we use fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify cells from the VZ, SVZ, CP and layers 5&6 to elucidate the epigenomic states of REs (and genes) using Histone ChIP-Seq. This will help us understand the molecular mechanisms that transmit regional patterning information from cortical progenitors to neurons (Aim 3). Finally, we define the function of REs related to cortical patterning using transgenic mice to assess RE activity (Aims 4) and REs deletions to define their role in gene regulation (Aim 5). Once integrated with human genetic information, this will enable us to gain powerful insights into how abnormalities in specific gene networks cause human neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9355302","Abstract/Project Summary Remarkable advancements in our nation's digital infrastructure combined with explosive growth in pervasive wireless connectivity have created the unprecedented potential to improve both our health and the delivery of healthcare. Beyond their universal availability, smartphones and the mobile networks that support them offer an unparalleled platform for health-related data acquisition and communications. The visionary Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort Program (PMI-CP) is possible, in large part, due to the availability of this digital infrastructure. However, to convert the enormous pool of mostly disjointed information available through a million-person longitudinal cohort into meaningful, life-changing medical knowledge requires development of an innovative, member-centric, engaging, and secure digital network that is state-of-art today, and by design, sustainably so over ensuing years and decades. In order to assure that the PMI-CP achieves its goal to transform the existing culture of medical practice and research by empowering patients, researchers and providers to work together as peers requires the collaborative support of many people with diverse expertise but a singular focus on participant-centeredness. The Participant Technologies Center (PTC) is a critical component to making that happen, and to ensure that we are able to successfully meet the needs of the PMI Steering Committee, and most importantly, the PMI participants, we have formed a network or world-class partners that together have the resources, experience and capabilities necessary to expertly address the known and not-yet known challenges of an endeavor as transformational and far-sighted as the PMI-CP. The Technology to Empower Change in Health (TECH) network is led by Scripps Translational Science Institute and Sage Bionetworks, and includes PatientsLikeMe, Qualcomm, Walgreens, Verizon, Lockheed-Martin, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, bringing together unprecedented experience and knowledge around participant engagement, digital security and personal technologies. Although the PTC is designed to optimize the utilization of technologies in the PMI-CP, our unwavering focus will be on the PMI participant and how to maximize the benefit of participation for them personally. We will accomplish this by laying a foundation built upon personalized engagement strategies, an resolute commitment to security and privacy, and assuring the availability of the state-of-the-art technology needed to meet all current and future data and information sharing needs. ."
"9139475","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This pathway to independence grant application describes the training and career development plan for Dr. John Clarke. Dr. Clarke's immediate career goal is to complete the necessary postdoctoral training in order establish a research project in toxicology that is independent from the work of his post-doctoral advisor, Dr. Nathan Cherrington. This goal is directly tied to the research proposed in the application, since this project takes the liver disease phenotype studied in Dr. Cherrington's group and applies it to exposure and toxicity of an environmental stressor. Dr. Clarke's long-term career goals are to 1) improve human health by advancing our understanding of the interaction between liver disease and environmental toxicant exposure, and 2) become a mentor to subsequent generations of scientists. These immediate and long-term career goals will be accomplished through specific aspects of the training environment and the research project. Dr. Clarke's training plan includes expanding his knowledge and recognition in the field of toxicology, developing new technical expertise, improving his mentoring and communication skills, and improving grant writing skills. In order to increase knowledge and recognition in the field of toxicology Dr. Clarke will participate in educational and training activities available through the NIEHS training grant, the Society of Toxicology, the Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, and the Arizona Health Sciences Center. These include seminars, journal clubs, colloquia, and conferences. Dr. Clarke has assembled a dream team of mentors and collaborators that will be an incredible asset for his career development and research plan. Dr. Clarke will develop new technical expertise in xenobiotic transport kinetics, in vivo toxicokinetics analyses, organ specific toxicity, and physiologically based toxicokinetics modeling (PBTK). An important aspect of being an independent scientist is the ability to mentor and communicate effectively. As part of the training environment Dr. Clarke will continue to present data at conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals. He will also continue to mentor high school, graduate, and undergraduate students in Dr. Cherrington's lab. Finally, he will improve his grant writing skills by participatig in a series of grant writing workshops offered at the University of Arizona and through the NIH. By implementing each aspect of this training plan, Dr. Clarke will receive the additional training he needs to successfully transition into an independent faculty position in toxicology. This research project seeks to understand how the liver disease nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) alters the toxicokinetics and toxicity of the waterborne toxin microcystin-LR (MCLR). The prevalence of NASH, which is the most severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, continues to increase worldwide and is estimated to be present in 5% to 17% of adults in the United States. In addition to the liver problems this population faces, there is also a higher incidence of chronic kidney disease among these patients, which may be associated with MCLR exposure. MCLR-producing cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in sources of drinking water around the world, and the occurrence of blooms and MCLR contaminated drinking water are expected to increase as anthropomorphic eutrophication of water systems and global climate change continue to worsen. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information regarding MCLR toxicokinetics in humans and how NASH-associated changes in xenobiotic transporter expression influence MCLR toxicokinetics and MCLR-induced toxicity. The objectives of this research are to 1) provide a complete picture of the xenobiotic transporters responsible for the disposition of MCLR and its main metabolites, MCLR-glutathione and MCLR-cysteine, 2) determine how altered expression of these transporters in NASH affects MCLR disposition and toxicity, and 3) move these findings towards risk assessment by constructing a PBTK model for human MCLR exposure in healthy and NASH populations. Dr. Clarke's previous work has demonstrated that NASH causes decreased expression of the liver uptake transporters important for MCLR-induced liver toxicity: organic anion transporting polypeptide-1b2 (Oatp1b2) in rodents and OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in humans. He has also shown that this NASH-induced decrease in rodent Oatp1b2 shifted the disposition of several drugs that are substrates for OATPs away from liver exposure towards kidney exposure. In the case of MCLR, it has been shown that genetic knockout of Oatp1b2 completely protected the mice from MCLR-induced liver toxicity. In a recently completed preliminary study Dr. Clarke has shown that MCLR exposure in NASH dramatically increase kidney toxicity compared to healthy controls exposed to MCLR. These data lead to the central hypothesis that people with NASH are at increased risk of altered MCLR exposure and MCLR-induced renal toxicity due to changes in hepatic OATP transporters. To test this hypothesis and achieve the objectives of this project several methods will be employed. First, in vitro transporter kinetics experiments will be performed to identify transporters, beyond the Oatps, that contribute to MCLR disposition. Second, the effect of NASH on MCLR disposition will be determined by measuring toxicokinetics profiles after oral and intravenous MCLR administration in healthy and NASH rats. Third, acute and sub-chronic, sub-lethal toxicity studies will be performed to determine if MCLR exposure in NASH increases renal toxicity. Lastly, a PBTK model for MCLR exposure in humans will be constructed using the Simcyp software to help translate this work into exposure information for human populations. The research project outlined here is important to the development of Dr. Clarke's career but, more importantly, it is important to millions of people worldwide who have NASH and are exposed to MCLR."
"9360168","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Los Angeles (LA) PRISMS Center aims to be the leader in the development and application of mobile health (mHealth) technologies that deepen our scientific understanding and clinical management of pediatric conditions. Bringing together leading experts from UCLA and USC in biomedical informatics, computer science, wireless health, environmental science and health, and pediatrics, this Center proposes creation of an innovative end-to-end software infrastructure for pediatric sensor-based health monitoring. Focusing on pediatric asthma, our Center's vision and proposed research is motivated by the following question: what if you could predict ahead of time, for a specific asthma patient, the potential for exacerbation and thus mitigate - if not prevent - the event? Any system with this ability must integrate the growing array of available physiologic and environmental data from sensors, and place such data into context to elucidate the patient's state and specific situation. The system must be able to act sufficiently quickly on sensed data to make timely recommendations, and end user compliance with system usage must be high to effect change. Our solution, the Biomedical REAl-Time Health Evaluation for Pediatric Asthma (BREATHE) platform, provides an extensible framework for the deployment of data collection protocols; secure data collection from sensors to a mobile device; integration of additional contextual information; and real-time analysis. Importantly, usability is a central consideration in the desig of BREATHE, reflected in an iterative design/evaluate/refine process. To build and assess BREATHE, the Center comprises three closely coordinated efforts: Project 1 - Integrated Sensing from the Device to the Cloud, which establishes APIs for automatically gathering information from a device and local sensors, communicating with the anticipated PRISMS U01 sensors and U24 coordinating data center; Project 2 - Integrating and Visualizing Clinical, Environmental, and Sensor Data, which focuses on combining data acquired from the U24 data center with contextual information (e.g., regional air quality, clinical elements from the patient' electronic health record, etc.) with real-time processing and analysis infrastructure; and Project 3 - Real-time Asthma and Air Pollution Project (Asthma APP), which develops a framework for evaluating system performance and real-world field testing of the platform for self-management and early interventions. BREATHE takes advantage of contemporary and open standards for secure networking and device management, mHealth toolkits, and mobile UIs from which open collaboration can occur. Collectively, these Projects' efforts realize BREATHE, changing how we interact with pediatric asthma patients and their caregivers to actuate a better understanding of the disease and improve adherence, and to achieve more personalized medicine through more detailed, objective measurements of an individual's daily activities and surroundings. For research, BREATHE will further enable testing of many hypotheses about environmentally-related chronic pediatric illnesses."
"8913769","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing are now commonplace despite a lack of comprehensive bioinformatics approaches for relating genotype to phenotype. The common method of analysis is to employ parametric statistics and then adjust for the large number of tests performed to limit false-positives. This agnostic approach is preferred by some because no assumptions are made about which genes or genomic regions might be important. The goal of our proposed research program continuation is to develop and evaluate a bioinformatics approach that analyzes genetic associations in the context of expert knowledge about biochemical pathways, gene function and experimental results using gene set enrichment (GSE) methods. An important challenge for success in this domain is the quality of the expert knowledge that is available in public databases such as Gene Ontology (GO). We first propose to develop and evaluate a novel Data-driven Ontology Refinement Algorithm (DORA) for improving the quality of genetic and genomic annotations (AIM 1). Improving the quality of annotations will in turn improve GSE results. We will then develop a comprehensive bioinformatics approach to the analysis of high-throughput genetic association results that considers functional DNA elements, genes, and gene function as important contexts. We will first determine whether considering data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) database improves GSE analysis at the level of gene regions (AIM 2). Next we will determine whether using GO annotations refined by our novel DORA algorithm (DORA-GO) improves GSE analysis at the gene set level above and beyond that provided by GO (AIM 3). We will determine the validity of these methods by assessing the replication of the results in independent data (AIM 4). AIMS 1-4 will be accomplished using several large population-based genetic studies of pre-clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) as measured by left ventricular mass (LVM). Our working hypothesis is that we will obtain more replicated and hence more real genetic associations using our novel bioinformatics methods that embrace, rather than ignore, prior biological knowledge."
"9177876","ABSTRACT  Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death accounting for more than 480,000 deaths each year, and 16 million Americans suffer from one or more diseases caused by smoking. Cessation of tobacco use can significantly reduce the risk of disease. Telephone quitlines are an effective and highly scalable way to help individuals quit smoking. However quitlines are an underutilized resource, and do not reach certain segments of the population, including males and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is a form of mind-body therapy that involves controlled visualization of specific mental images, and shares similarities with mindfulness meditation. Multiple studies have shown that exposure to mindfulness and imagery training results in significantly increased smoking abstinence rates. Also, imagery is used by a significant number of racially diverse male and female athletes. Although imagery is an effective tool for smoking  cessation, the mode of delivery has generally been in person, limiting the dissemination to large populations. We hypothesize that guided mental imagery delivered using the uitline ?coaching model? combined with an interactive website could be an effective and disseminable intervention strategy. In addition, this model may be more readily accepted by underrepresented smokers, and may increase the reach and effectiveness of telephone quitlines. Therefore, the objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking cessation. We will develop the intervention and attention-control condition, study procedures, training protocols, and competency testing models with input from quitline personnel, and focus and user groups of smokers in preparation for a randomized clinical trial. We will conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on recruitment, retention, and preliminary estimates of the potential effects of the guided mental imagery intervention on quitline callers? tobacco use, cravings, and self-efficacy to quit smoking. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the Imagery Intervention or a matched control condition delivered by project imagery coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence of tobacco use. A subsample of 20 quitters will be tested for salivary cotinine as biochemical validation of self-report in this population.  Secondary outcomes will be self-reported cravings and self-efficacy. A manual of procedures will be developed to prepare us to conduct a future randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the imagery intervention. The proposed project has the potential to advance the science of tobacco cessation through the addition of guided mental imagery, and improve public health through increased reach of telephone quitlines. It is innovative in that it uses guided imagery to address theory-driven targets of self-efficacy for abstinence and cravings. If successful, this model could be expanded to address other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity and other substance use."
"9230024","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is to continue the work of UNC's existing PRC (Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention - HPDP) but with a new focus on the link between community and health care efforts to prevent and control disease (CDC Domain 4), by developing and testing a technology-assisted community health worker implementation strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention with initial emphasis on low income, rural communities with large populations of underserved minorities. To support this effort and the broader work of the Center in its role to enhance public health practice through high quality research, HPDP will build new capacity in dissemination and implementation (D&I) research, adding faculty expertise in systems dynamic modeling and health services research. In addition, faculty with research and practice experience in health information technology and patient centered medical homes will join the team. The Center will collaborate with statewide stakeholders to disseminate EBIs and build public health practitioners' capacity to implement EBIs that target all levels of the socio-ecologic model. The center will build on community collaborations over the past 25 years to address the winnable battles -- nutrition, physical activity, obesity, and tobacco --that are most relevant to CVD prevention and treatment. Our efforts will be guided by NCCDPHP (CDC) strategic priorities (health equity, research translation, systems solutions, and sustainability) and the National Prevention Strategy (healthy community environments, quality preventive services, empowering personal health choices). Currently there is a widely recognized gap in coordination between primary care and public health. Community Health Workers have demonstrated the potential to significantly impact chronic disease risk factors, but coordinated programs between clinic and public health departments that collaborate with community health workers have not been adequately tested. The applied research project for this proposal, referred to as CHANGE (Carolina Heart Alliance Networking for Greater Equity) is designed to create and test new structures to leverage the complementary strengths of clinics and public health departments coordinated through technology-assisted community health workers, thereby expanding the reach and effectiveness of both clinical and community multi-level evidence-based interventions. The research design includes formative data collection to refine the CHANGE strategy; a pre-post comparison to assess implementation and effectiveness; a matched-control pre- post comparison to assess the CHANGE strategy's effects on the proportion of the clinic's total at-risk population that have cholesterol and blood pressure under control as compared to three matched comparison clinics; and finally planning for taking the CHANGE strategy to scale by replicating it in one additional community, identifying its core components, creating and disseminating a replication toolkit, and promoting the strategy's adoption through NC's multiple clinical, public health, and research networks."
"9240232","This revision application is submitted in response to PA-13-302, Research Project Grant (Parent R01). The purpose of this revision application is to add tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to grant 1R01AG050440-01A1 entitled Diabetes and Brain Amyloid in Middle Aged Hispanics?, using the Tau ligand 18F-THK-5351, for in-vivo neuroimaging of paired helical filament tau aggregates. The parent R01 already funds brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid ? (A?) PET. The funded period for the parent grant is 09/01/15 to 06/30/20. The funding period of the proposed revision application is 10/01/16 to 05/31/20, overlapping with the funded project in its last 4 years of funding. The main goal of this revision proposal is to study whether diabetes status (type 2 diabetes [referred to as diabetes] and pre-diabetes, compared with normal glucose tolerance [NGT]), is associated with increased tau accumulation in the brain, one of the culprits of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in a community-based sample of middle aged Caribbean-Hispanics with a mean age of 63 years. In this application we refer to tau imaging as imaging of paired helical filament tau aggregates, not normal cytoskeletal tau. We propose to add tau PET imaging with the ligand 18F-THK-5351 taking advantage of the ongoing funded parent R01 of A? PET imaging with 18F-Florbetaben PET in 150 middle aged Hispanics with concurrent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and assessment of cognition and diabetes status, at 2 time points, 24 months apart. Our primary hypothesis is that diabetes and pre-diabetes are related to accumulation of brain tau aggregates as compared with NGT. Our secondary hypotheses are that brain tau aggregates mediate the association of diabetes and pre-diabetes with memory impairment, and brain A? and CVD interact with tau aggregates in causing memory impairment. Our primary aim is to compare the amount of tau accumulation, measured with 18F-THK-5351, in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex, cross- sectionally and longitudinally (with an interval of 2 years) between participants with diabetes (n=50), pre- diabetes (n=50), and NGT (n = 50). We will also examine glycemia continuously using Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as an exposure. Secondary aim 1 is to explore whether differences in tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex among participants with diabetes, pre-diabetes, and NGT, mediate the association of diabetes and pre-diabetes with worse memory performance. Secondary aim 2 is to explore the interaction of tau in medial temporal and inferior temporal cortex with (a) brain fibrillar A? and (b) CVD in mediating the association of diabetes and pre-diabetes with memory impairment. These aims are our main focus. However, we will be able to explore effect modification by APOE-?4, other correlates of diabetes as exposures (insulin, components of the metabolic syndrome), other regions of interest for tau accumulation, and the temporal relation of the accumulation of brain tau aggregates and A?."
"9348770","Summary Mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage are early pathological features of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected brain. A? has deleterious effects on mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms and strategies to rescue such injury remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the role of mitochondrial A? in AD pathogenesis. Accumulation of mitochondrial A? may be an initiating pathological event leading to mitochondrial and neuronal perturbation. TOMM40 (Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane-40kD) is the key subunit of the TOM complex, the main entry channel for the vast majority of imported proteins must pass to enter the mitochondrial interior. A polymorphism inTOMM40 is associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD and decreased cognitive performance48. This polymorphism is the only nuclear-encoded gene identified in genetic studies to date that presumably contributes to LOAD-related mitochondrial dysfunction. A? and APP can be imported into the mitochondria through the TOMM40 channel in an in vitro cell culture, however, the TOMM40-mediated A? import mechanism remains unclear and the impact of TOMM40 on amyloid pathology, mitochondrial and synaptic degeneration, and neuroinflammation in A? milieu have not yet been elucidated. In our pilot studies, we observed that TOMM40 knockdown mice displayed significantly reduced mitochondrial A? levels, along with improvement in mitochondrial and synaptic function in Tg mAPP mice overexpressing A?. Furthermore, reduced TOMM40 levels in Tg mAPP mice attenuate the innate immune and proinflammatory response. These data suggest that TOMM40 may potentially be of importance in mitochondrial amyloid pathology of AD. We hypothesize that impaired function of TOMM40 contributes to chronic mitochondrial A? accumulation relevant to developing amyloid pathology of AD, leading to mitochondrial and synaptic degeneration. The goal of this proposal is to gain new insight into the role of TOMM40 in AD pathogenesis, focusing on mitochondrial A? accumulation/clearance, amyloid pathology, synaptic mitochondrial properties, oxidative stress, inflammation, and synaptic function, utilizing a novel genetically manipulated transgenic TOMM40/AD mouse models and neuronal culture with altered TOMM40 levels (gaining/losing) in an A?-rich environment (genetic deficiency of global and neuronal TOMM40 and increased neuronal TOMM40 in AD-type transgenic mice overexpressing A?). The outcomes of the project could present that TOMM40 might be a potential new therapeutic target for limiting mitochondrial amyloid pathology thereby halting AD progression."
"9144757","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical error is one of the leading causes of death in the US. The study and reduction of medical errors have become a major concern in healthcare today. It is believed that medical error reporting systems could be a good resource to share and to learn from errors if medical error data are collected in a properly structured format and are useful for the detection of patterns, discovery of underlying factors, and generation of solutions. Effectively gathering information from previous lessons and timely informing the subsequent action are the two major goals for the design, development and utilization of such a system. The Common Formats (CFs) suggested by AHRQ tend to unify the future reporting format, which holds promise in improving data consistency and reducing unsafe conditions through lessons learned. However, effective gathering medical incident data does not merely rely on a unified structure. To be able to learn from previous lessons, it heavily depends upon the quality reports and learning features offered by systems. Medical incident data are always the key components and invaluable assets in patient safety research. The long term goal of the project is to understand the occurrence and causes of medical incidents in real practice and to develop interventions based on collection of incident reports to minimize the recurrence of similar incidents that have been reported. The objective of this application is to improve the utilization f voluntary reporting systems that each healthcare institution has been put in use by developing a learning toolkit that can systematically collect and analyze incident reports, automatically link historical reports with WebM&M, the highest quality of voluntary reports and expert reviews in patient safety. As moving toward CFs, the researchers propose a user-centered, learning-supportive, and ontological approach that will help reporters generate complete and accurate reports through user-friendly guidance and offer timely comments and relevant peer reviews through educational tools during and after incident reporting. The researchers employ a case-based reasoning and natural language processing techniques to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the knowledge-based toolkit which helps reporters improve the communication about patient safety through clear working definitions and advance training that builds knowledge about the safety culture and then provides continuing education through the system. The project holds promise in revolutionizing the design of voluntary medical incident reporting systems from an incident data repository to an advanced resource promoting complete and accurate incident reporting and learning toward a just and learning culture."

"9109525","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Policymakers have embraced pay-for-performance and shared savings/risk models to improve healthcare and moderate cost growth in publically funded healthcare programs. There is a strong commitment by both public and private payers to move from volume-based payment toward payment models rewarding value. The Affordable Care Act authorized Medicare to contract with accountable care organizations (ACOs), networks of providers responsible for the health care of a defined population. While implementation of these programs is moving forward rapidly, there is little evidence to guide whether these programs have the potential to yield real cost savings while improving quality. Under the R21 phase of this application, we will complete an evaluation of Medicare's Physician Group Practice Demonstration, a joint pay-for-performance and shared savings effort in 10 multi-specialty physician groups. The Physician Group Practice Demonstration reforms are similar in many respects to the currently legislated ACO reforms, and thus qualify as the best evidence we have to date of the effects of ACO incentives. Yet beyond bonus payments and quality scores publicly reported for each of the ten sites, little is known about how the incentive scheme affected overall costs, quality or outcomes. Our data analysis begins with a simple difference-in-difference strategy, with local Medicare beneficiaries as controls, to measure the effect of the Demonstration on Medicare payments and quality metrics beyond those measured for payment purposes. We will expand the comparison groups to similar physician practices beyond local controls and will focus on accounting for selection into the program and the role of risk adjustment in study of costs and outcomes. In addition, a major objective of our research will be to develop a structural model of Medicare payment reform incentive schemes, with parameters estimated using outcomes arising from the Physician Group Practice Demonstration, that we believe can explain some part of the heterogeneity observed in provider responses to the PGPD. The milestones for completion of the R21 phase will include development of a theoretical model of ACO incentive schemes, completion of appropriate control groups and estimation of a selection model, specification of appropriate quality and outcome measures, and adequate risk adjustment measures. In the R33 phase of the application, we will apply techniques and models developed in the R21 phase to the Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings Programs, which will include a greater number of accountable care organization participants and more subtleties in incentive design."

"9157911","Project Summary/Abstract In utero exposure to multiple environmental chemicals has been shown to adversely impact health throughout the lifespan, leading to adverse birth outcomes, neurodevelopmental deficits, diabetes and obesity, and cancer. Yet, a key data gap limiting our ability to characterize and address developmental health risks is the lack of data on the extent to which neonates are exposed to the vast array of industrial chemicals used in the US. Over 90% of the chemicals manufactured and used in high volumes (>25,000 pounds/year) in the US are not measured in large-scale human biomonitoring studies. Further, the current biomonitoring approach requires a priori selection of compounds for which to develop and validate targeted analytical methods; the lack of data on chemical use in industrial or commercial products hinders the ability to accurately anticipate to which of the almost 8000 high use chemicals the US population is most likely exposed. To address these challenges, our project will advance an innovative, discovery-driven research project using liquid chromatography- quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS) to perform a General Suspects Screen for the presence and co-occurrence of approximately 700 Environmental Organic Acids (EOAs) in a demographically diverse population of maternal-neonate pairs. We will also demonstrate how this screen can inform the selection of chemicals for targeted analysis methods development while addressing demographic disparities in EOA exposure and the extent to which maternal serum levels accurately reflect in utero exposures. We focus on EOAs because they are more easily detected by our LC-QTOF/MS and thus are a good model for our novel approach. Also, they are structurally similar to chemicals known to adversely impact development and thus are of potential health risk. Using LC-QTOF/MS, we will screen 300 matched umbilical cord and maternal serum samples, collected from a racially and economically diverse population, for ~ 700 EOAs. Using the LC- QTOF/MS results, we will identify 10 EOAs with potential for widespread human exposure and for demographic and maternal-neonatal exposure disparities. We will develop LC-MS/MS methods to confirm and quantify these 10 EOAs, and evaluate the performance of the LC-QTOF/MS screen. We will compare umbilical cord serum levels of the 10 EOAs in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic white, US? versus foreign-born, and low? versus high-income subgroups, and assess differences in exposures between maternal-fetal pairs. Our discovery-driven, suspect screen will pioneer a biomonitoring approach that prioritizes chemicals for targeted method development based on their likelihood of detection in the human population. It will also be an invaluable resource for other researchers who may query it for novel chemical exposures during the prenatal period. Finally, we will also make substantial contributions to the inventory of targeted methods for environmental chemicals and generate critical new exposure data on vulnerable and susceptible populations that is foundational to characterize and inform prevention of health risks from harmful chemicals."
"9330995","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Learning to discriminate new shapes is a fundamental visual ability for humans and other primates. It depends on long-term changes in shape computations in the ventral pathway of primate visual cortex, especially at final stages in IT (inferotemporal cortex). Our goal is to investigate these changes at the level of individual neurons and neural circuits, by (i) analyzing progressive shape computation changes in continuously identified neural populations across long timescales (weeks to months) and (ii) correlating these changes with improvements in shape discrimination accuracy and speed. We would achieve this goal by combining methodologies developed in our two laboratories. The Connor lab has developed mathematical analyses of neural shape computations, based on large-scale adaptive stimulus sampling guided by genetic algorithms and multi- dimensional parameterization of stimulus geometry. The Leopold lab has developed the use of microwire bundle implants for long-term electrophysiological recording from populations of IT neurons, continuously identified by their signature response patterns across 100s of stimuli. Adaptive sampling can leverage the order of magnitude increase in sampling time with microwire bundles, offering a new paradigm for high- throughput testing of mathematically tractable object stimuli in ventral pathway cortex. Based on our previous investigations of shape coding and shape processing dynamics, we hypothesize that learning to discriminate a new shape accurately and rapidly is based on a progression through distinct combinatorial computations operating on that shape's constituent fragments: (i) Initial low-accuracy behavior reflects linear combination of shape fragment signals, present in the untrained state, yielding only ambiguous information about complex shape configurations; (ii) Increasing accuracy during early learning reflects recurrent network nonlinear computations, yielding slow but unambiguous signals for shape fragment combinations; (iii) Increasing speed during late learning reflects feed-forward nonlinear computations, yielding accurate, fast performance. Chronic microwire recording will allow us to track this computational progression, for dozens of individual neurons, and correlate computational changes with behavioral improvements through time. This would be the first continuous observation of computational changes in individual IT cells during extended periods of visual learning (weeks to months). Whether or not the specific hypotheses are verified, this will provide the most direct insights to date into how specific changes in IT circuit-level information processing relate to shape learning, which is critical to our understanding of symbols and objects."

"9336097","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches.

"9052078","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect affecting up to 2% of live births and is associated with serious complications and life-long management. Genome scanning is a developing standard of care for CHD patients, which identifies genetic etiology in only about 10-20% of cases. For these patients, discovery of the pathogenic gene offers targeted therapies for improved outcomes. The genetic cause for the remaining 80-90% of cases remain undefined, leaving patients deprived of optimized personal treatments. By taking genomic information from CHD patients and modeling genetic aberrations in Drosophila, novel CHD candidates will be identified and their role in cardiac development and pathogenesis can be better understood, which will provide much needed genetic information to drive treatment for CHD patients. For example, the gene Nascent polypeptide Associated Complex-? (NAC?) was identified from a screen utilizing patient information. Preliminary data suggest that NAC? is involved in heart remodeling during fly metamorphosis. Knocking down NAC? levels results in an unremarkable cardiac phenotype in larvae however, intriguingly, following metamorphosis, adult flies lack a heart. The functional role for NAC? will be explored during embryonic and pupal stages, by evaluating its interactions with its heterodimeric partner (bicaudal) and developmental genes known as hox genes (abd-A and abd-B) in setting the spatial boundaries for apoptotic events necessary for remodeling of the heart. Because of the high similarity in developmental processes between Drosophila and vertebrates, these findings will translate and influence studies in mammals. In order to identify novel CHD genes, we will screen in Drosophila, genes that are found within Copy Number Variants (CNV) regions of CHD patients. CNVs are deleted/duplicated genomic regions between 1KB-5MB that are present at higher rates in CHD patients and likely contain pathogenic genes. By misexpressing these candidate CHD genes in flies, pathogenic genes will be identified by assessing their impact on cardiac function and development. The candidate genes will also be misexpressed in commercially available human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes, to assess for changes in Ca2+ handling and cell division/differentiation, which could provide mechanistic insight and narrow down a conserved function. Future work can test the functional interactions and relationships between candidate genes and known developmental genes, which will help grow and refine the established genetic network driving development. Establishing the developmental roles of candidate CHD genes will allow for their categorization that should improve CHD diagnosis. Furthermore, an enhanced understanding of development may uncover novel therapeutic targets leading to personalized treatment of CHD and other cardiac conditions."
"9197820","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9353966","The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the ?early? detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to its development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to finemap already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this twostage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ?convenience controls? f rom the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the ?early? subclinical phenotypes identified through the use of VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease."

"9128004","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is treated by risk factor management for which the only modifiable risk factor is intraocular pressure (IOP). Previous physiologic studies identified the trabecular meshwork (TM) as the primary resistor to aqueous humor outflow from the eye and determined that diseased TM in POAG caused increased IOP. Simultaneously, pathology in the post-TM anterior sclera and intra-scleral distal outflow pathway has been implied with the level of disease here also being nearly equivalent to that of the TM itself. This observation coupled with recent and variably successful IOP lowering from minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS), designed to simply bypass the TM, further confirms that IOP is more complex than just the TM. The global goal of this proposal entitled Discovery and Characterization of Anterior Sclera Pathology in Glaucoma is to identify novel, uncover the molecular mechanisms of, and realize the importance of continued impediments to aqueous humor outflow downstream of the TM in the anterior sclera and intra-scleral distal outflow pathway.  In Specific Aim 1, we will apply modern histological techniques to revisit prior and rudimentary suggestions of post-TM scleral and intra-scleral outflow pathway fibrosis and collapse.  In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the molecular mechanisms for scleral and intra-scleral distal outflow pathway fibrosis by applying knowledge regarding known pro-fibrotic agents such as TGF-ß in the TM to freshly harvested glaucomatous sclera obtained during canaloplasty surgery.  In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the impact of TGF-ß mediated fibrosis on sclera and the intra-scleral distal outflow pathway by studying permeability characteristics via newly generated glaucoma scleral cell lines and by the development of a new animal perfusion model.

The current available systems include three MRI scanners (3T- human, 4T- human  and animal, and 7T- animal) and several cutting-edge multi-modality imaging systems for small animal  imaging: a) combined MRI- Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) system, b) combined MRI-SPECT (Single  Photon Emission Computed Tomography) system, and c) hybrid X-ray microCT-Optical Tomography system.  The 4T MRI scanner provides an open architecture for development of new imaging methods, as well as for  integration of a second modality such as DOT to form a combined system. Besides optical imaging, we have  built world's first MR compatible SPECT system for small animal imaging. In addition to this we have  developed a 3-D fluorescence & bioluminescence tomography system integrated with a micro CT. These multi-  modality imaging systems are available for general use at this point. Beyond this small animal imaging  instrumentation, we have been working on several new multi-modality systems for breast cancer imaging, MR-  Optical and MR-Nuclear Imaging, and we are planning to make them available for Cancer Canter members in  the next years. These systems will support various needs of CFCCC members in designing innovative imaging  components into their studies, providing complementary anatomical and functional information. Additionally,  our shared resource also supports translational clinical studies, with a precise protocol execution and a high  standard quality control. For example, we have been supporting the collection of more than 900 breast MRI  studies with unified protocols, and as such a large database has been collected. In the next cycle we will  continue to support such clinical studies, and also to support translational clinical research using the multi-  modality imaging systems in our portfolio, such as to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the combined  MRI-Optical and MR-Nuclear imaging systems for breast cancer.  Overall, the IVFOI Shared Resource provides CFCCC Members with ready access to state-of-the-art  technologies, consultation for design of experiments and imaging protocols, and image acquisition and data  analysis, as well as coordination among individual projects. Through the sharing of imaging and analysis  protocols, we can integrate various information obtained from different projects to facilitate future collaborations  between CFCCC members and to bring together basic scientists and clinical researchers to design and  conduct clinical translational studies."
"9197815","PROJECT ABSTRACT The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. We have brought together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9352934","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal focuses on the regulation of ocular surface inflammation by lumican, an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein at the ocular surface. Eight million people worldwide suffer from infections, allergies and autoimmune conditions leading to corneal scarring and blindness. The ECM has a significant role in modulating the local inflammatory milieu, while its breakdown can present immune cells with endogenous danger signals to drive excessive immune responses. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of ECM- immune interactions are not understood. In its most abundant form lumican is a structural protein that regulates collagen architecture to generate a transparent cornea. Recently, we identified its N-terminal domain to interact with leukocyte surfaces to promote toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediated host response to gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins. In a remodeling ECM during infections and inflammation, the immune-interactions of lumican can be a double-edged sword - needed for development of protective innate immunity, but unrestricted can drive chronic inflammation. Our current goals are to gain molecular insights into lumican - innate immune cell interactions, to develop strategies to strengthen protective immunity and diminish immune dysregulation using lumican-based peptides and antibodies. As our in vivo inflammatory setting we will use LPS and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) keratitis models in wild type and lumican-deficient mice. Additional recombinant lumican variants, peptides, anti-lumican antibodies and cell cultures models have all been developed in the laboratory for this study. The following hypotheses will be tested in three aims. Aim 1: Hypothesis - Lumican promotes immune response by increasing pericellular LPS or modulates lipid rafts to enhance TLR4 recruitment to the cell surface. Lipid rafts are centrally important in innate immune signal transduction and clinically relevant as targets of therapy. We will use primary macrophages, cell lines, recombinant lumican, biochemical, confocal and FRET analyses to address lumican involvements at the cell surface. Aim 2: Hypothesis - The immunologically active N-terminal domain is unavailable for immune cell interactions in collagen-associated lumican. We will use recombinant lumican and three variants that either have the N-terminal domain or the central collagen binding domain to test this hypothesis. Collagen-pretreated lumican variants will be tested for their abilities to induced LPS response in culture. Secondly, the variants will be transiently expressed at the ocular surface of wild type and lumican deficient mice, and challenged with keratitis to address their role in modulating the cytokine milieu, innate and adaptive immune cells and ocular surface inflammation. Aim 3: Hypothesis - Ocular surface inflammation can be modulated by lumican-based peptides or anti-lumican antibodies. We will test if an antibody against the N- terminal domain or mimetic peptides can modulate lumican-immune cell interactions to ameliorate inflammation in the keratitis models to develop the premises for localized treatments of inflammation."
"9108608","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Perinatal brain injury often results in cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental disability. Consequently, developmental disabilities place a huge burden on society, emphasizing the paramount need for improved prevention/treatment strategies to reduce individual and societal burdens related to perinatal brain damage. Therapeutic strategies are currently not available for infants with brain damage, except for hypothermia, which can only be used in full term infants for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and is only partially protective. Recent studies suggest that fetal inflammation is a strong predictor of perinatal brain injury. Inflammatory processes in utero are likely antecedents of brain damage in preterm infants as cytokine elevations predict neonatal brain damage. The blood-brain barrier (BBB)/neurovascular unit (NVU) is a privileged site consisting of brain micro- vascular endothelia, glia, and neurons that regulate the microenvironment for neural functioning. A novel ap- proach to prevent perinatal brain injury would be to target the BBB with agents to preserve its function to limit entry of toxic substances into brain. This proposal is based on the central hypothesis that cytokines cross the BBB in the fetus to damage the brain and that blockade of cytokines attenuates damage to the BBB/NVU and the brain parenchyma. Our published data show that blocking effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines with systemic infusions of cytokine neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) attenuate ischemia-related increases in BBB permeability in the ovine fetus. The novel overall goal of this continuation of an R01 is to elucidate the effects of systemic inflammation on BBB/NVU function to determine whether blocking cytokines with systemic antibody infusions attenuates inflammation-related damage to the BBB/NVU/brain parenchyma in the fetus. A multidisciplinary approach to address the specific aims includes physiological, biochemical, pathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular methods. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that systemic inflammation (induced by LPS) results in increases in BBB permeability measured both with ?-aminoisobutyric acid and radiolabeled cytokines, as a function of gestational age, and a result of changes in the NVU. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that cytokine-specific neutralizing mAbs prevent inflammation-related increases in non- specific BBB permeability, cytokine transport into brain by attenuating damage to the NVU, and, thus, reduce parenchymal brain damage. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that inflammation-related increases in BBB permeability are prostanoid dependent by determining whether cyclooxygenase inhibition prevents LPS-induced BBB dysfunction. Understanding how the BBB/NVU responds to inflammation and mechanism(s) responsible for damage to BBB/NVU will facilitate development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Treatment of neonates with anti-cytokine mAb would be feasible, as humanized anti-IL-1? antibody is currently in use to treat inflammatory conditions and shows beneficial effects in pediatric trials. This project could provide new insights into novel strategies to prevent brain injury in the human fetus and/or full term and premature infant."
"9121611","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of our ongoing project, Discovering and applying knowledge in clinical databases, is to learn from data in the electronic health record (EHR) and to apply that knowledge to relevant problems. The advent of the electronic health record (EHR) greatly amplifies the ability to carry out observational research, opening the possibility of covering emerging problems, diverse populations, rare diseases, and chronic diseases in long-term longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, the EHR carries additional challenges. We believe that the biggest challenge comes from the inaccuracy, incompleteness, complexity, and resulting bias inherent in the recording of the health care process. Put another way, EHR data are not simply research data with more noise and missing some values; instead the EHR carries systematic biases that must be addressed before the data can reach their potential. We propose to characterize the effects of the health care process on EHR data, to enumerate the potential biases, and to provide mechanisms to circumvent them. In effect, we propose to study the EHR as an object of interest in itself, using new models, data mining, existing knowledge bases, and innovative algorithms to better understand EHR biases so that we can identify them and correct them or avoid them. We include expertise from two of the nation's major phenotyping projects, eMERGE and OMOP.     We hypothesize that we can learn about biases due to the health process through data mining and knowledge engineering and that we can correct or at least avoid those biases, enabling us to better answer informatics and clinical questions. Our aims are as follows: (1) Study health care process biases by correlating raw EHR variables with a panel of health care process-related variables (e.g., admission), using lagged correlation to account for temporal effects, and populating a health care process resource with the correlations and observations. (2) Find associations among raw EHR variables using lagged correlation, information theory, Granger causality, and temporally ordered N-tuples of events, correcting for the health care process biases discovered in Aim 1. (3) Facilitate the definition of higher-level clinical phenotype concepts by applying knowledge resources-including eMERGE and OMOP phenotype definitions and ontologies such as our Medical Entities Dictionary and the UMLS-to the fruit of Aims 1 and 2 to produce semi-automated and automated phenotype query definitions. (4) Develop a high-throughput method to validate phenotype definitions by measuring the ability to uncover known associations, use the generated phenotypes and associations to answer clinical questions, and disseminate the results, including a large knowledge base of correlations that can be used by other researchers to conduct their own studies."
"9034827","?     DESCRIPTION:  Heart disease is the leading cause of death and morbidity in many countries in the developed world, including the United States. Due to the terminally differentiated and non-proliferative nature of cardiomyocytes, the heart is unable to regenerate and repair itself after infarction, and the resulting chronic cardiac dysfunction often leads to death within 5 years. Stem cell-based therapies involving the direct injection of cells into infarcted tissue have garnered much attention recently. However, while these therapies hold tremendous potential, the overwhelming cell death and limited ability of graft cells to integrate with the surrounding host tissue limit their effectiveness at restoring cardiac function. The goal of the proposed research is to develop injectable, three- dimensional myocardial matrix-graphene composite scaffolds that mimic the electrical, mechanical and biochemical environmental cues seen in healthy myocardium, and then to test their ability to generate functional tissues. The central hypothesis is that the high conductivity of graphene will enhance action potential propagation through direct and indirect (e.g. increased gap junction formation) mechanisms, thereby improving the functionality of the incorporated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. By combining the unique characteristics of graphene and native myocardial matrices synergistically, we aim to create a new class of three-dimensional scaffolds for the engineering of cardiac tissues for therapeutic purposes. Towards this end, we will first develop biocompatible and injectable myocardial matrix-graphene 3D composite scaffolds with tunable electrical and mechanical properties. Then we will evaluate the capability of conductive 3D composite scaffolds in enhancing cardiomyocyte electrophysiological function in vitro."
"9071736","PROJECT SUMMARY ? DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS  Developmental funds come from two sources: the CCSG and the institution. SCI has expended  approximately $27 million (direct) in developmental funds in the current grant period for recruitment, seed  grant awards, and developing cores. Funds for recruitment were used to substantially improve capabilities  in solid tumor translational research and population sciences. New recruits have been able to secure  significant peer reviewed cancer research funding since joining SCI. Funds for the seed grant program  awarded in 2009-2013 have produced an 8:1 return on investment, as measured by follow-on grant funding.  Funds for new cores have supported the Stanford Cancer Institute Research Database (SCIRDB), a data  warehouse that combines de-identified patient data with other relevant data to facilitate research related to  patient outcomes. SCIRDB has now been integrated into the Biostatistics and Research Informatics Shared  Resource. Funds for developing cores have also been used to initiate a biorepository to support large  national and international consortium studies related to population sciences, as well as the expansion of the  genomics core.  SCI expects to spend $43 million in developmental funds in the next grant period, of which $1.25 million  (total direct) is requested from the CCSG. Developmental funds will continue to support recruitments, seed  grants, and developing cores. Top recruitment priorities include faculty in the areas of solid tumor  translational research, the behavioral sciences and survivorship research, and immunology. $10 million is  allocated for seed grants. Funds will continue to be used to develop the biorepository as a shared resource  and a new organoid core facility."
"9166951","Project Summary  Physiological homeostasis is essential for maintenance of ocular lens transparency and accommodation, the dysregulation of which can lead to cataract formation and impaired vision. Despite continued efforts, a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of ionic and osmotic homeostasis within the lens is lacking. Owing to this gap in knowledge, we are yet to identify therapeutic avenues to prevent or delay cataract formation, a leading cause of blindness worldwide. In this exploratory application, our broad objective is to investigate and understand the role of calcium binding protein, S100A4, in lens integrity and function. Deficiency of S100A4 leads to late onset cortical cataract formation in mice.  Motivation for this proposal stems from our recent novel observation that S100A4, a small molecular weight calcium binding protein involved in cell motility, differentiation and osmoprotection, exhibits a rather discrete and intense distribution pattern in differentiating lens fibers within the eye. Most significantly, absence of S100A4 leads to cortical cataract formation in mice, with progressive histological changes in lens fiber cell morphology and organization presenting by six months of age. Interestingly, hyperosmotic stress also significantly elevated the levels of S100A4 in normal mouse lens. Although S100A4 has been studied extensively in metastasis of various cancers and is considered a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for different cancers, the physiological role of this protein is largely unknown. Therefore, this application not only addresses the role of S100A4 in lens osmotic and calcium homeostasis and lens function for the first time, but also leverages the lens as a model system to elucidate the physiological role of S100A4.  Since nothing is known about S100A4 function in lens and cataractogenesis, this developmental proposal seeks to gain molecular and cellular insights into how deficiency of S100A4 accelerates cortical cataract formation, under two specific aims. Aim 1 will investigate the cellular and molecular basis underlying the requirement of S100A4 for lens transparency by performing detailed histological, biochemical, cytoskeletal and gene expression analyses of S100A4 null mouse lenses during maturation and aging. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that elevated levels of intracellular calcium, calcium-dependent protease activity and impaired osmoadaptation are causative factors in cortical cataract formation in S100A4 null mice.  Our expectation is that successful completion of the studies described in this exploratory proposal will have a significant impact on: 1.Deciphering the physiological role of S100A4, 2. Fundamental molecular mechanisms involved in lens homeostasis, and 3. Unraveling the etiological mechanisms of late onset cortical cataract formation. Importantly, we envision that the data derived from this developmental proposal will lay a strong foundation for a comprehensive future project addressing the role of S100A4 in lens integrity, function and cataractogenesis."
"9238291","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The use of solid scaffolds that provide cells with mechanical and chemical cues is a promising approach for guiding tissue repair and promoting tissue-scaffold integration. It is becoming increasingly clear that tuning scaffold rigidity is a powerful way to control cell function, but how scaffold rigidity regulates gene expression is not well-understood. Previously, we tested the hypothesis that substrate rigidity controls gene expression by tuning nuclear tension. We took advantage of the fact that the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton-to-cytoskeleton) complex is a known molecular linker of the nucleus to the cytoskeleton, and asked how it regulates the sensitivity of genome-wide transcription to substrate rigidity. Our results were the first to show that the LINC complex facilitates mechano-regulation of expression across the genome. Combined with myosin inhibition studies, we were able to identify genes that depend on nuclear tension for their mechanosensitivity. In this continuation, we propose to identify molecular mechanisms for these highly novel findings. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To identify the nuclear molecular linkers necessary for rigidity-mediated control of gene expression. Aim 2: To determine the mechanisms by which nuclear-cytoskeletal linkage regulates gene mechanosensitivity. Scientifically, this work addresses important and longstanding questions about the mechanisms by which the cell microenvironment controls gene expression. Clinically, the long-term impact of this work is to promote the rational development of new biomaterials with mechanical properties tuned for tissue engineering and repair. An additional benefit is the development of an integrated approach using both technologies from engineering and techniques from molecular cell biology for addressing a fundamental question in rigidity sensing. This work is of fundamental interest to diverse fields including cell-biomaterial interactions, nuclear and cell mechanics and molecular and cell biology of gene regulation. The project builds collaboration between the groups of Lele (University of Florida), Nickerson (University of Massachusetts Medical School) and Roux (Sanford Research). Each laboratory brings unique resources to this research including access and expertise in using sophisticated optical and electron microscopes, strong expertise with wet-bench cell and molecular biology experiments specifically related to the nucleus, and expertise in cell and nuclear mechanosensing and biomaterial development and characterization. The team will also benefit from the support of well-known molecular and cell biologists and bioengineers who have pioneered experimental techniques in a broad number of areas in LINC complex biology, nuclear/chromatin structure and function and tissue biomechanics."
"9168972","Project Summary/Abstract For multicellular organisms to maintain distinct and specialized cell types, the genomes of a given lineage have to be partitioned such that unwanted developmental programs become heritably repressed. This partitioning is carried out by a nuclear ultrastructure called heterochromatin. We now understand that in stem cells, genome partitioning is highly dynamic, in that pre-existing small heterochromatin regions progressively expand (?spread?) in differentiation. This dynamic behavior contrasts with our prior understanding, which indicated that heterochromatin regions are delimited by hard-wired, DNA sequence encoded ?start? and ?stop? sites. Yet, this dynamic heterochromatin spreading is absolutely required for normal differentiation, and we do not understand how it is mechanistically accomplished or regulated by the cell. Here, we propose to uncover the biochemical and genetic basis of dynamic heterochromatin spreading in embryonic stem cell differentiation. The dynamic spreading reaction remains opaque because it has not been addressed at the appropriate length scale and timescale. Heterochromatin spreading occurs over stretches of the chromosome, 100s to 1000s of nucleosomes, and over a certain time window after S-phase. Previous studies have focused on documenting genome-wide effects, obtained in static snapshots. To capture the dynamics of the process at the correct length- and timescale, we will deploy two cutting edge, purpose built testbeds: 1) We will follow heterochromatin spreading in real time in single stem cells, following the induction of differentiation programs. This will be enabled by a multiple fluorescent reporter based heterochromatin spreading sensor we recently validated. The dynamics of long-range spreading have to date not been visualized. 2) We will biochemically reconstitute the heterochromatin spreading process using modular, barcoded chromatin reagents. We will determine the propagation kinetics of histone methylation, the spreading signal, and the biochemical activity of boundary elements in stopping this process. The spreading reaction has to date not been successfully reconstituted. Using these testbeds, we can ask several critical questions about dynamic, heterochromatin-driven genome partitioning: How does the cell regulate dynamic spreading? One hypothesis would be that the spreading reaction itself is tuned. An alternative hypothesis is that spreading is promoted by removal of a ?block?, i.e. via dismantling of spreading boundaries, or rearranging chromosome structural territories. Our testbeds will allow us to distinguish between these hypotheses. Additionally, we will begin to address the question whether spreading is a driver of differentiation, or a consequence of it, exploiting the exquisite resolution of our single cell system. Finally, we intend to use dynamic heterochromatin spreading as a means to identify and remedy inefficiencies in differentiating lineages from induced pluripotent cells. We will use the combination of our testbeds to devise tools to artificially tune the spreading reaction at will, in order to achieve genetically stable lineage decisions and provide highly predictable differentiation for regenerative medicine."
"9191773","SUMMARY A primary goal of the auditory system is to transform acoustic stimuli arriving at the ear into distinct perceptual representations (i.e., sounds or auditory streams). Traditionally, auditory perception is associated with the hierarchical computations that occur along the ?ventral? auditory pathway. However, several lines of evidence indicate that the ?dorsal? auditory pathway (i.e., the intraparietal area [area LIP])?which is traditionally associated with sound localization and audiomotor processing?may also contribute to auditory- stream perception. In particular, it is thought that the dorsal pathway contributes to the processes that allow an auditory stream to be segregated from a background environment (i.e., auditory scene analysis, including figure-background segregation). This grant proposal tests the contribution of area LIP to auditory-stream perception by evaluating the neural principles that underlie auditory-stream perception in the dorsal auditory pathway. To achieve this goal, we test the contribution of neural activity in macaque lateral intraparietal area (area LIP) to auditory perception while monkeys participate in an objective test of auditory streaming (i.e., the ?streaming? task). This single-interval two-alternative forced-choice task requires a monkey to report whether a ?test? stimulus is to the left or to the right of a ?reference? stimulus, while in the presence of a ?masker? stimulus. By titrating the temporal coherence between the reference/test and the masker stimuli, the reference/test stimuli become grouped or segregated from the masker stimulus. That is, they become single or distinct auditory streams. This manipulation also makes the task more or less difficult. In Aim #1, we identify the contribution of neural activity in macaque lateral intraparietal area (area LIP) to auditory-stream perception. The contribution of spiking activity in the dorsal pathway to auditory-stream perception is not fully understand. To gain insight into these neural mechanisms, rhesus monkeys participate in the detect-target task. We record single-neuron LIP spiking activity while monkeys perform the streaming task. We test two hypotheses. Specifically, we hypothesize that (1) monkeys will perform better when the test stimulus is presented incoherently from the masker stimulus (i.e., when they segregate into different streams) than when they are presented coherently (i.e., grouped into one stream) and (2) LIP sensitivity will reflect the degree to which the test and masker stimuli form separate streams and will correlate with behavioral performance."
"9224453","Project Summary  About 6.3% of the US population (ages 12+) have misused prescription (Rx) drugs in the past year, with this prevalence almost double among young adults ages 18-25. Unintentional poisoning deaths involving opioid pain relievers (Rx drugs most likely to be abused) have more than quadrupled from 1999-2010, and now outnumber deaths from heroin and cocaine combined. Deaths related to Rx drug poisoning surpassed motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury-related mortality in 2009. The increase in the use of opioid pain relievers is due in part to the liberalization of laws governing the prescription of opioid analgesics for chronic pain, the introduction of new and more aggressive pain management standards, and the availability of new drugs. This project will estimate the effects of key state initiatives targeting Rx drug abuse. These include mandatory prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), an ID requirement at the dispensing stage, and required physical exam of the patient prior to prescribing. For most states participation by prescribers and dispensers in the PDMP is voluntary, and hence PDMP utilization rates are quite low and well below 50%. Furthermore, there is very limited research on the effects of these policies despite recommendations by the Obama administration and many state health departments to institute these programs. In addition to addressing this knowledge gap, this project will also assess whether these policies have had unintended consequences in terms of raising heroin use, which has more than doubled among young adults over the past 5 years. Among illicit drug users, Rx abuse is second in prevalence only to marijuana, and 1 out of 4 new illicit drug users began their habit with non-medical use of Rx drugs. Thus, unintended consequences in the form of greater use of heroin or other illicit drugs may occur as availability of Rx drugs is reduced by state programs. Alternatively, positive spillovers are also possible if the number of individuals who acquire an opioid addiction and consequently transition to heroin or other illicit drugs is reduced. Five complementary data sets will be utilized to investigate these policy effects across a range of self-reported and objectively measured Rx and illicit drug-use and drug-related health outcomes. Considerable variation in the adoption of these initiatives across and within states, including staggered adoption of different policies within the same state, will be exploited within a difference-in-differences (DD) research design to identify credible causal effects. The models will be supplemented with various checks and sensitivity analyses, including testing and adjusting for the assumptions underlying the DD estimation, assessing reinforcement effects across the policies, assessing cumulative effects, assessing cross-border spillovers, and assessing heterogeneous policy responses. The proposed research will provide the most comprehensive study to date of the effectiveness and possible unintended consequences of key state initiatives aimed at curbing Rx drug diversion. These estimates will yield valuable evidence informing policymakers on the mix of regulations effective in reducing Rx abuse."
"9103978","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Proper development of the nervous system requires the coordinated, timely growth and differentiation of axons and dendrites in order to generate precise neuronal connections and functional neural circuits. The goal of the proposed studies is to further explore molecular and cellular mechanisms of visual circuit formation, particularly those that influence both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal morphology and connectivity during retinotectal wiring. Here, we will test the hypothesis that Down-Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM), a gene implicated in a number of developmental disorders, differentially influences early events in the targeting and branching of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons as well as in the maturation of their target neurons in the brain, and that this in turn modulates the  establishment of functional visual circuits. The proposed studies build on our laboratory's novel and important finding that DSCAM, a molecule implicated in Down Syndrome and in Fragile X, plays a distinct, but key role in both the early development of neuronal morphology and the connectivity of central neurons, particularly of those neurons that receive input from RGCs. Specifically, our studies show that DSCAM limits dendrite growth and influences the directionality and branching of dendritic arbors in optic tectal neurons in a manner that is independent from its regulation of RGC axon branching. These proposed studies utilize real-time imaging of neurons in developing Xenopus laevis embryos, and state-of-the art gain  and loss-of-function approaches to manipulate DSCAM expression in single neurons. By inducing both localized and rapid cell-autonomous responses in both retinal and central neurons, we aim to demonstrate that regulated expression of DSCAM shapes both pre- and postsynaptic connectivity in the developing retinotectal system. These studies will also examine mechanisms by which DSCAM collaborates with netrin 1 to establish the patterning of tectal neuron dendritic arbors. Furthermore, our studies will explore the hypothesis that global dysregulation of DSCAM expression within the retina or optic tectum impacts retinotectal circuit formation and the functional maturation of the visual circuit. By imaging responses of individual neurons in the intact, developing brain, and correlating structural changes with functional assays that test vision, our studies aim to advance our understanding of the organizing principles that shape functional connectivity in the central nervous system. Elucidating early molecular mechanisms of circuit development that differentially impact pre- and postsynaptic connectivity has broad implications for understanding human neurodevelopmental disorders in which altered brain function is associated with deficits in early connectivity as seen in Down syndrome, mental retardation, and autisms."
"9203539","Aging is associated with dysregulation of immune function manifested by increased susceptibility to infections and an increase in chronic inflammation. Such chronic inflammation, especially the presence of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-?), are predictors of failing immune status and mortality in the elderly. Associated with these changes is an increase in autoantibody responses and some autoimmune diseases. Environmental factors play a significant role in the development of human autoimmunity, however age has not figured significantly in studies on environmentally- induced autoimmunity other than the observation that occupational exposure is a significant factor. Mercury exposure has been implicated in the expression of autoimmunity in humans and experimental animal models. The human populations at risk are sizable and diverse. We have extensive experience in the use of murine mercury-induced autoimmunity (mHgIA) as an experimental model to study the initiation and development of systemic autoimmunity. The animal age at exposure in these studies have ranged from 4-12 weeks with the length of exposure usually being 4 weeks. Disease severity is dependent upon the presence of IFN-? and IL-6, and localized inflammatory response associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1?, IFN- ? and TNF-?. It remains unknown if induction of autoimmunity by mercury is exacerbated by the age-related chronic inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine expression found in both humans and mice. The importance of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-? and IFN-? in aging and in mHgIA and idiopathic autoimmunity suggests that aging will lead to exacerbation of mHgIA compared to younger animals. This application will test the hypothesis that advanced age impacts the experimental outcomes of mHgIA used to study environmentally-induced autoimmunity in adult human populations. The proposed research will proceed in two phases as outlined in the FOA (RFA-AG-16-020). The UH2 phase will focus on breeding cohorts of animals up to the 75% survival level of B10.S, B10.S/Ifng-/- and B10.S/Il6-/- mice and includes a cohort to be used for a preliminary test of the feasibility of using aged animals to induce mHgIA. The UH3 phase will compare the central hypothesis that ?older ages of animals impact experimental outcomes? by comparing and contrasting mHgIA in old versus young male and female B10.S mice. We will also use B10.S/Ifng-/- and B10.S/Il6-/- mice to examine the contribution of IL-6 and IFN-? to age associated proinflammatory responses and whether they are requited for development of age-related autoimmunity, and whether exposure to HgCl2 exacerbates autoimmunity in aged animals deficient in either IL-6 or IFN-?."
"9130784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overexpression and amplification of HER2 denotes a poor prognosis and outcome for breast cancer patients. Despite the availability of targeted anti-HER2 therapies, the clinical benefit of anti-HER2 agents is short-lived. We have made the unexpected observation that HER2+ human BC cell line HCC1954 exhibits a switch from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation metabolism as resistance to the anti-HER2 kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, sets in. Additionally, we have found that the dual EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib lengthens the cell cycle time of HER2+ HCC1954 breast cancer cells without increasing apoptosis or cell death. This lengthening of the cell cycle correlates to reduced proliferation and population doublings under lapatinib treatment, as well as metabolic changes. Upon generating lapatinib-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cells, we discovered that lapatinib resistance conferred sensitivity to the metabolic inhibitor phenformin. These data suggest that HER2+ breast cancer cells may have adapted altered ErbB signaling networks to overcome anti- HER2 treatment and use alternative metabolic strategies to fuel uncontrolled proliferation. The goal of this application is to investigate HER2+ breast cancers switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism in response to lapatinib treatment, and its relationship to resistance. We will use paired parental and drug-resistant cell lines to assess the metabolic effect of targeted anti-HER2 treatment on a functional and molecular level with single cell resolution. Furthermore, the population dynamics of sensitive and resistant cells treated with anti- HER2 and phenformin will be interrogated using acute and chronic animal models. We believe that lapatinib resistant cells will be more sensitive to phenformin in vivo, and the use of phenformin will reduce tumor burden. Our approach includes an assessment of drug treatment perturbations at a cellular level, complemented with a more focused analysis of the altered redox metabolism at a molecular level. Collectively, we hope to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of anti-HER2 resistance, probe the feasibility of metabolic inhibitors as anti-cancer therapy, and recapitulate drug action and response. If we are successful, our results may open the door to novel combination therapy including lapatinib and metabolic inhibitors such as metformin, which may improve performance of anti-HER2 targeted therapy and inhibit resistance."
"9099511","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a chronic optic neuropathy resulting in visual field defects and progressive, irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common form. Rates of glaucoma are projected to increase by 50% to 3.36 million people by 2020, causing a significant economic and quality of life burden. Risk factors for glaucoma include advanced age (65+ years), family history of glaucoma, race (African American, Asian), and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino). Diabetes is also an independent risk factor for glaucoma. African Americans develop glaucoma at a younger age, progress more rapidly, and are almost 7 times more likely to go blind than non-Hispanic Caucasians. Despite the advanced technology and available diagnostic testing, 50% of people with glaucoma remain undiagnosed. When glaucoma is diagnosed in its early stages, appropriate treatment and management can almost always prevent blindness. Under the leadership of L. Jay Katz, MD; Julia A. Haller, MD; and Lisa Hark, PhD, RD, the Wills Eye Glaucoma Research Center will conduct a 5-year prospective, randomized controlled trial to test an innovative community intervention using fundus photography of the optic nerve and macula (telemedicine) to detect, treat, and manage high-risk patients with previously undiagnosed glaucoma and other eye diseases. Our diverse, targeted at-risk population includes African Americans, Hispanics and Asian over age 40; older adults (aged 65+); and those over age 40 with a family history of glaucoma and/or diabetes. Phase 1 will consist of recruiting approximately 2,000 patients from 14 primary care offices and 10 federally qualified health centers across Philadelphia and Chester counties with our community partners. Using telemedicine, we will detect eye disease using telemedicine (Visit 1) followed by a comprehensive eye exam by a glaucoma specialist to confirm the diagnosis (Visit 2). Based on preliminary data, 30% of patients (approximately 600) will have abnormal optic nerve and/or macula images. The predictive accuracy of the optic nerve images to detect glaucoma and glaucoma suspect as confirmed by the comprehensive eye exam will be evaluated. Phase 2 will involve consenting, enrolling, and randomizing 300 patients to either the usual care group (n=150) or the enhanced intervention group (n=150) and scheduling follow-up eye exams with local, general ophthalmologists (Visit 3). The enhanced intervention will consist of using patient navigators and a social worker to reduce barriers to follow-up eye care. Phase 3 will consist of following patients proximally (6 months) and distally (3 years) while they attend ophthalmology appointments (Visits 4-8). Adherence to follow-up recommendations for eye care will be the primary outcome measure. A comprehensive cost study to estimate the intervention costs and cost-effectiveness of detecting eye diseases and vision impairment in a high-risk population will also be conducted. Protocols, materials, and results will be disseminated to other communities in order to expand detection of glaucoma, other eye diseases, and visual impairment, and to further refine these approaches."
"9255353","Research efforts of the Poly-Orth International demonstrated feasibility of the novel ?Residuum-Integration Prosthetic Technology to be used in direct skeletal attachment of limb prosthetics. The technology includes a ?Skin and Bone Integrated Pylon?

"9358502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In May 2012 Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) joined eMERGE II with our Boston Children's partner. Since then we have developed algorithms for the electronic health record (EHR), led the Pediatric Workgroup, developed pharmacogenomics, evaluated the preferences of parents and caregivers to advance genomic medicine and assimilated technical advances into our EHR. The eMERGE effort has become the basic fabric of the institutional initiative to incorporate the extraordinary advances of genetics, genomics and the electronic medical record into healthcare. In addition, we bring a comprehensive EHR (EPIC), operating in every venue for healthcare delivery at CCHMC; a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 1.2 million patient records; and a Biobank with 150,000 consents that allow return of results to 38,000 patients and guardians who have provided 58,000 DNA samples, all with consent to return results and i2b2 EHR records. Now, we present our plan to join the eMERGE III network with 17 proposed initiatives. Our eMERGE effort is designed to move an entire institution with our eMERGE III partners into a genomic-EHR era of healthcare implementation and discovery. Our effort is divided into Genomics , Aim 1, where we hope to help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify the 100 or so genes for the eMERGE III Targeted Gene Panel (eTGP), select our 2,000 CCHMC patients to be sequenced (of the 38,000 in our Biobank), review 4,000 targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis (CASSI). For Phenotypes, Aim 2, we will extend our work generating EHR phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods with a comprehensive set of EHR features derived from data driven algorithms to describe phenotypic pleiotropy of eTGP gene variants. We will develop working collaborations with Patients Care Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and the Million Veterans Program by applying eMERGE developed EHR algorithms to these large electronic data warehouses. For Implementation and Evaluation, Aim 3, we will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, analyze the cost of tacrolimus management of kidney transplant with and without CYP3A5 testing, develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning eTGP results. Our success in these eMERGE III studies will be enhanced by the ongoing institutional investments made in the CCHMC BioBank, the comprehensive EHR (EPIC), and the i2b2 deidentified medical record data warehouse, and hundreds of Faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. We present a comprehensive program addressing all of the salient elements presented in the RFP for eMERGE III (HG-14-025) to enhance our collaborative productivity within the eMERGE Network in ways that ultimately improve our healthcare systems through discovery, implementation, and advanced applications of genomics and informatics."
"9145218","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Whether apoptotic stimuli arise from the nucleus, cell membrane surface, or the mitochondria, ultimately, the stimuli converge on a process of activation of a family of cysteine proteases known as the caspases (cysteine aspartases). Activation of caspase family members mediate programmed cell death in normal physiology and a number of diseases, with caspase-3 standing at the center of the cell death program. Existing in a non-active pro-enzyme form in the cytosol of resting cells, caspase-3 is one key effector protease when activated. Thus, to monitor the final commitment of cells to death pathways, the need exists to directly quantify the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in vivo. To meet this challenge, we designed and synthesized a class of peptide-based imaging agents that can penetrate the cell via non-receptor-mediated endocytic pathways, gaining access to the cytosolic compartment. These cell-penetrating optical imaging agents contain quenched fluorophores flanking target protease sequences which are cleaved and activated by caspase-3. Upon cleavage, these agents show caspase-3- dependent fluorescence signal amplification, thereby enabling high quality enzyme-specific molecular imaging of intracellular processes in vivo. Importantly, we discovered that upon intravitreal (intraocular) administration, our cell-penetrating peptides selectively accumulate in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retinal neurons which are selectively injured and degenerate in glaucoma. RGCs are particularly accessible through an intravitreal approach, a routine ophthalmological procedure now performed every day in the clinic. Thus, we plan to exploit this unanticipated and exciting cell-type-specific property of our peptides in retinal pathology for molecular imaging applications in ophthalmology. This renewal application is focused on translation of this strategy through advanced pre-clinical studies and development of a lead peptide. We propose pre-clinical testing in glaucoma models, toxicology testing, and metabolite profiling. We will advance a lead peptide into the clinic through pilot studies in a unique non-human primate model of glaucoma. These activities benefit from the combination expertise of this applicant team in chemistry, molecular imaging, biochemistry, and vision biology."
"9149169","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The transformation from a manufacturing economy to one based heavily on services and technology has resulted in the depopulation and impoverishment of communities that have depended primarily on their industrial bases. Consequent blight and neglect, coupled with a lack of opportunities for youth with high school educations or less, have resulted in elevated rates of youth violence in many affected cities. The Michigan Youth Violence Prevention Center (MI-YVPC) will study the effects of improving vacant properties on violence, property crimes and intentional injuries among youth in Flint, MI, Youngstown, OH and Camden, NJ. We will compare a community and youth-engaged approach to maintaining and improving vacant properties to similar maintenance implemented by contractors from outside the neighborhoods. We will assign properties to receive community-engaged or professional maintenance and compare the effects of these two conditions to vacant lots that are unimproved. We will also conduct a three-phased implementation study that will involve documenting the development of greening activities in Camden, NJ, and survey over 100 communities nationwide who have implemented greening programs about their experiences and lessons learned in creating their programs and engaging youth in the process. The aims of the Center are to: 1) implement and evaluate community-level strategies in Flint and Youngstown and analyze the relationship between changes in the physical environment and 10-24 year old youth violence; 2) test alternative approaches to greening, contrasting professional maintenance with youth engagement through intergenerational collaboration in Flint and Youngstown on police incidents, youth intentional injury, parcel assessment of nearby properties, and resident survey responses; 3) document the process of community readiness and capacity needs for implementation of a greening program in Camden, NJ; 4) identify lessons learned that facilitate or hinder development of community and youth engaged greening programs, and disseminate the results of our research to local, state, and national audiences through a wide variety of venues, including a freely available implementation guide. The MI-YVPC is a partnership among the University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, the Center for Community Progress, and land banks, economic development organizations, health departments, hospitals, police departments and community-based organizations in each city."
"9175321","ABSTRACT: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is a life-saving therapy, but one that is still plagued with complications, the most deadly of which is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD (AGVHD) occurs in as many as 70% of transplant recipients, despite their treatment with multiple immunosuppressive drugs. Moreover, Grade III-IV GVHD, especially involving the GI system, is often untreatable, leading to high rates of post-HCT morbidity and mortality. These issues give rise to three central challenges in the field. They are: (1) What are the mechanisms that drive breakthrough T cell allo-immunity and tissue damage despite current immune suppression strategies? (2) Can we design treatment strategies to directly target these mechanisms? and (3) What are the necessary components of a GVHD-prevention strategy that will safely produce long-term immune tolerance? To address these questions, we have developed and refined the only non-human primate (NHP) model of GVHD, and have used this model to discover a series of new insights into the immunology of this disease. These include: (1) That a systems biology approach can be applied to GVHD to uncover central mechanisms and targetable pathways. (2) That AGVHD can be divided into ?primary? and ?breakthrough? mechanisms: with primary GVHD driven by Th/Tc1 pathways, while breakthrough GVHD is driven by IL17- predominant pathways. (3) That primary AGVHD can be successfully controlled by calcineurin Inhibitor-free CD28:CD80/86 blockade + rapamycin. These discoveries form the core of our new understanding of AGVHD and inform the next phase of our work. This work is based on the overarching hypothesis that the tissue- specific molecular mechanisms controlling GVHD can be identified, and that by targeting these mechanisms, an evidence-based approach to the prevention and treatment of this disease can be achieved. We will test this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Evidence-based GVHD Prevention: This Aim will determine strategies by which immune escape pathways, identified through transcriptome analysis, can be targeted to prevent GVHD. Aim 2: Tissue-Specific GVHD Diagnostics: In this Aim, we will establish a transcriptomic map comparing blood- liver, and GI-specific immune activation during NHP GVHD, using both population- and single-cell techniques. Aim 3: Evidence-based GVHD Treatment: In this Aim we will determine the mechanisms controlling breakthrough GVHD in both NHP and patients and test novel treatment strategies in our newly-developed NHP GVHD Treatment Model."
"9084774","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Terminal ventilator withdrawal is a process that entails the cessation of mechanical ventilatory support with patients who are unable to sustain spontaneous breathing and is commonly performed in the ICU. Ventilator withdrawal is undertaken to allow a natural death. Opioids and/or benzodiazepines are administered before, during, and after as an integral component of the ventilator withdrawal process to prevent or relieve respiratory distress, but there are few guidelines to determine how much to administer or when. Insufficient opioid and/or benzodiazepine administration places the patient at risk for unrelieved respiratory distress and preventable suffering. Conversely, excessive medication administration may hasten death, an unintended consequence, and one that concerns clinicians. The effective doses of medications given during ventilator withdrawal are unknown. We hypothesize that an algorithmic approach to ventilator withdrawal, relying on a biobehavioral instrument to measure and trend distress, will ensure patient comfort, and guide effective opioid and/or benzodiazepine administration. We plan to use a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial with all clusters providing unstructured usual care until each cluster is randomized to implement the algorithmic approach (intervention). The proposed study is innovative because there is no standardized, evidence-based approach guided by an objective measure of respiratory distress to this common ICU procedure. The study has broad clinical significance to provide knowledge that can potentially reduce patient suffering."
"9249834","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: HIV viral load (VL) monitoring is a crucial component of the ongoing scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Uganda recently launched a nationwide VL testing system; however, significant implementation gaps have emerged in three critical areas: (1) inadequate VL ordering, (2) slow generation and reporting of VL results, and (3) suboptimal interpretation of VL results for adherence counseling. Additionally, significant disparities exist in sub-populations at high-risk of virologic failure including (1) pregnant women, (2) children and adolescents, (3) persons whose last VL was detectable, and (4) persons missing a VL test. To address the implementation gaps on how best to improve VL ordering, speed up VL turnaround time, and improve VL counseling, we propose a comparative effectiveness, clinic-level cluster randomized trial of a targeted, multi-component intervention package called ?RAPID-VL? among 1,200 high-risk and non-high-risk patients in 20 PEPFAR-supported ART clinics in southwest Uganda. Anchored in the PRECEDE implementation science framework, ?RAPID-VL? consists of (1) a VL ordering flowsheet to increase correct VL ordering, coupled with a performance feedback system to reinforce best practices, (2) a point-of-care VL machine at a hub near the clinics that will speed up the generation and delivery of VL results to clinicians, and (3) a VL counseling package that teaches clinicians an efficient method for counseling patients on VL results. Aim 1: Determine the comparative effectiveness of the RAPID-VL intervention on VL ordering and VL turnaround time: We will randomize HIV clinics to RAPID-VL vs. standard VL procedures (n=10 clinics each, 60 patients/clinic, comprised of 20 non-high risk patients plus 10 high risk patients in each of 4 categories), and will compare (1) guideline-indicated VL ordering, (2) VL turnaround time, (3) VL suppression, (4) VL re- suppression after a detectable result, and (5) switching to 2nd line ART. Aim 2: Identify facilitators and barriers to implementation, as well as perceived utility of RAPID-VL from both patient and clinician perspectives. We will measure fidelity to each RAPID-VL component via in-clinic observations and training assessments. We will perform qualitative interviews of 20 clinicians and 40 patients to capture facilitators, barriers, acceptability and sustainability of RAPID-VL and examine its perceived utility.  Aim 3: Determine the costs, cost-effectiveness, and incremental gain costs of RAPID-VL: We will conduct micro-costing analyses of key cost inputs including training, clinician effort, point-of-care VL machinery, and transportation costs. We will compare these to costs of the current standard of care DBS-based system on unit cost and ?cost-per-added success.? We will also estimate cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for RAPID-VL. Our overall objective is to rigorously test a novel intervention to improve VL operations in PEPFAR- supported Ugandan HIV clinics. Our long-term goal is to maximize the public health impact of ART by optimizing processes for VL testing. This will improve health, lower mortality, and accelerate ART expansion.    "
"9166681","PROJECT SUMMARY Hypertension is a major global health concern. In the U.S. alone, one-third of all adults have hypertension and this rises to two-thirds by the age of 60. Hypertension is a key contributor to morbidity and mortality from stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and renal failure/dialysis. Unfortunately, despite current treatment, blood pressure remains poorly controlled in approximately 50% of individuals with this disease. Even when blood pressure is reasonably controlled, hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. There is emerging evidence from our lab and others that this residual risk and the end- organ effects of hypertension are largely mediated by inflammation. For example, mice that are deficient in T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages, or one of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines exhibit blunted hypertension and reduced end-organ dysfunction in response to hypertensive stimuli. Yet most of these studies have been conducted in experimental animals, particularly rodents, with limited studies examining the effect of inflammation in human hypertension. Moreover, global or even partial immunosuppression in humans is not without risk. To address this problem, the first goal of this proposal is to utilize a cutting-edge single cell multiplex mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) approach to profile the immune cells in the peripheral blood of normotensive and hypertensive humans to identify unique and possibly rare subpopulations that are altered in human hypertension. In mass cytometry, antibodies to extracellular and intracellular targets are conjugated to rare earth metal isotopes that are detected by a mass spectrometer. As obesity and aging are intricately associated with hypertension, our study population will include people with a range of body mass indices and age (35 to 75) to determine the extent to which observed hypertensive changes in immune profiles correlate with obesity and aging. The second goal is to isolate these novel or altered cell populations through flow sorting and further characterize them by RNA-sequencing, cytokine production, and/or deep sequencing of T cell receptors in the case of T lymphocytes. Mapping the immunological landscape of hypertension, obesity, and aging promises to lead to new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies to treat human hypertension and limit the associated end-organ damage from this chronic, widespread disease without inducing global immunosuppression."
"9228189","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Novel therapeutic approaches are desperately needed to improve the prognosis for glioma patients. Developing such approaches will require the delineation of key regulatory networks specific to glioma cells and leading to neoplastic transformation and enabling tumor growth. Past studies in mouse models identified oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) as putative cellular origin of astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. Data from our lab showed that the switch from asymmetric, self-sustaining to symmetric, self-renewing divisions is a critical step in the neoplastic transformation of OPC. Therapies specifically interfering with aberrant symmetric cell divisions are expected to eliminate malignant OPCs and disrupt tumor growth. It is our long-term goal to develop such therapies, by defining the effect of glioma- associated genetic alterations on the asymmetric-to-symmetric cell division mode switch. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that abnormal spindle microcephaly associated Aspm mRNA expression is upregulated in glioma cells by constitutive-active receptor tyrosine kinase signaling via PI3K- AKT. We further propose that Aspm protein positively regulates symmetric divisions and thereby promotes neoplastic transformation and malignant growth. Functionally, Aspm positively regulates mitotic spindle integrity and positioning. We will achieve our objective by pursuing two independent aims. In Aim 1, we propose to identify the molecular switch from asymmetric to symmetric division in OPC, by determining if activation of the PDGFR?/EGFR-PI3K-AKT axis directly elevates Aspm transcript levels and thereby positively regulates symmetric cell division mode and increases proliferation rate. We expect that upon completion of these experiments, we will for the first time have demonstrated that the switch of cell division mode is regulated by an extrinsic signal through modulation of Aspm levels. In Aim 2. we will validate Aspm as a proto-oncogene and Aspm functions as therapeutic opportunities. We will suppress Aspm expression using RNAi in a selected panel of glioma cells with constitutively active PDGFR? or EGFR signaling. We anticipate that Aspm suppression will cause glioma cells to favor asymmetric divisions, which will decrease their proliferation rate and reduce their malignant potential. We anticipate that Aspm spindle regulatory functions provide novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in glioma cells. These studies can delineate a paradigm for enforcing symmetric cell division and tumorigenesis in all progenitor-driven tumors. By unraveling Aspm upregulation as a specific step in the neoplastic transformation of progenitor cells we identify a point of susceptibility for cancer therapies and provide a treatment paradigm for other progenitor-derived cancers."

"9164177","SUMMARY Short interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, capable of highly specific gene knockdown, has emerged as a promising molecular therapeutic tool in targeted cancer treatment. Nonetheless, only limited success has been achieved in the systematic administration of siRNA, due to a series of hurdles such as kidney filtration, uptake by phagocytes, aggregation with serum proteins and enzymatic degradation. Existing delivery systems (e.g. viral vectors or inorganic nanoparticles) all face significant challenges, such as high immunogenicity, toxicity, and limited tuning capacity in particle size/shape/functionality to achieve optimal efficacy. Versatile DNA nanoparticles (DNPs) offer a paradigm shift in delivery vehicles because of the unprecedented programmability of DNA nanotechnology. These DNPs offer unique advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility and minimal toxicity. However, the lack of comprehensive study to improve the delivery efficiency and specificity of DNPs has hindered their application in the therapeutic delivery of siRNA. We propose to perform a systematic study of DNPs as siRNA delivery vehicles, based on our main hypothesis that optimized physical (e.g. size and shape) and chemical (e.g. arrangement of targeting ligands) properties of DNPs can greatly enhance therapeutic siRNA delivery efficiency and specificity, and enable specific knockdown of target genes in vitro and in vivo for cancer. Utilizing our strong expertise in DNA nanotechnology, we will design and construct a library of DNPs in a high-throughput fashion, perform systematic investigation of how their properties affect the delivery efficiency, specificity, therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo with siRNA as the delivery cargo, and develop effective and safe DNP systems. The proposed experiments will be carried out in the following specific aims: (1) To determine the formulation of DNPs with enhanced delivery efficiency and specificity. Our initial work will focus on polyhedral structures of varied sizes and linear structures. Functional moieties (e.g. folic acid) will be incorporated into DNPs to improve their stability, targeting capability, and cell uptake efficiency. The experimental process will follow a design, test, optimization (redesign) cycle with five basic steps: (a) DNP design, (b) DNP construction, (c) morphology/stability characterization, (d) cell internalization, and (e) siRNA delivery and knockdown studies. (2) To examine the therapeutic efficacy, biodistribution and organ toxicity of Bcl-2-siRNA?conjugated DNP (DNP-siBcl-2). It is not known whether the surface chemistry of DNPs affects their efficacy, toxicity or biodistribution differently in vivo. We have chosen to knock down Bcl-2, which is one of the critical regulators of apoptosis. Here, we will examine folate receptor-targeted DNP-siBcl-2 (DNP-siBcl-2-FA) to determine therapeutic outcome, biodistribution and organ toxicity in vivo in a mouse model. Both cell and mouse models will help consolidate our findings to improve our understanding of siRNA delivery and the molecular mechanisms of action of DNP-siBcl-2."
"9292166","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? MASS SPECTROMETRY CORE The Mass Spectrometry Core will support research into the causes of tau toxicity in the context of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). The core will apply quantitative proteomics approaches to characterize post- translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of wildtype and FTD-mutants of tau. Although tau mutations and dysregulations are prominent in FTD, little is known about tau function in this disease, which is a common cause of young-onset dementia. A thorough description and exploration of tau- mediated FTD will provide a significant and essential resource for the neurological disorder community. We will comprehensively characterize tau PTMs in different cellular compartments and tissues using a novel platform we have developed that allows for the selective enrichment of tau from human brain tissues and cells. Combined with quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) approaches, we will comprehensively monitor acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and methylation sites and determine their regulation in the context of FTD mutations. We will validate FTD mutant regulated PTM sites using a targeted approach called selected reaction monitoring (SRM). In contrast to systematic PTM site mapping which is used for hypothesis generation, SRM allows hypothesis testing by quantifying an a priori selected set of PTM sites in a highly accurate, sensitive, and reproducible fashion across many conditions and larger sample sets. Additionally, we will generate PPI maps for tau in the context of mutations, perturbations, and different cellular localizations. We will use classical affinity purification followed by MS (AP-MS) and novel APEX-based proximity biotinylation to identify tau-interacting proteins mediating aberrant activity and homeostasis in FTD neurons. We will study the interactome associated with both normal and FTD-mutants of tau in autophagosomes, autolysosomes and endosomes, and characterize the mechanisms of how tau is released in an activity-dependent manner as well as study the cellular machinery involved in normal or mutant tau uptake. The Core will interact with the CRISPR Core to functionally validate proteomics data and with the Data Core to integrate datasets and share results with the scientific community."
"9243591","Background: The success of liver transplantation with good short-term and long-term survival rates has resulted in its widespread use for treatment of many patients with end-stage liver disease. The current 1-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rates are 84%, 68% and 54%, respectively. According to the American Liver Foundation, more than 6,000 liver transplants are performed each year in the United States. The most common complication in the early post-transplant period is acute cellular rejection (ACR), occurring in 20-40% of patients. Diagnosis of ACR by serum biomarkers is not specific and confirmation requires a liver biopsy, which is invasive and may cause hemorrhage and mortality. In addition, needle liver biopsy samples only about 1/50,000 of the liver and is limited by sampling variability and inter-observer variation in histological interpretation. At the Mayo Clinic, patients receive a liver biopsy on day 7 post-transplant if serum liver enzymes remain elevated. Approximately 60% of biopsied patients have ACR and are treated with additional immunosuppression, followed by a second biopsy on day 14 to evaluate treatment response. A noninvasive biomarker of ACR with high sensitivity and specificity may provide a better alternative to biopsy to reduce complications and facilitate more frequent follow-up and monitoring of the allograft. Our Goal is develop ultrasound-based methods to quantify mechanical properties of the liver for the purpose of noninvasive ACR diagnosis. The field of ultrasound elastography has developed various techniques to measure mechanical properties of the liver, most of which ignore tissue viscosity. All biological tissues are inherently viscoelastic and ignoring the viscous component not only biases the estimates of elasticity but also fails to report a potentially important tissue parameter. Disregarding tissue viscosity also masks potentially complex pathophysiological changes that manifest in structural changes affecting both elasticity and viscosity by grouping the two terms under the elasticity parameter. The omission of tissue viscosity largely stems from the inability to make stable measurements of shear wave attenuation. Several techniques have proposed model-based methods to estimate tissue viscosity by assuming a fixed relationship between wave velocity and attenuation without any knowledge of tissue attenuation. Because it is difficult to measure tissue attenuation in vivo, these models cannot be verified. Thus, the only appropriate approach for true measurements of tissue viscoelasticity requires independent measurements of wave velocity and attenuation. Attenuation Measuring Ultrasound Shearwave Elastography (AMUSE) is a method developed by our group that measures shear wave velocity and attenuation at multiple frequencies independently to provide true model-free characterization of tissue mechanical properties and is the first and only method of its kind. AMUSE is a post-processing method and is compatible with the current ultrasound shear wave elastography system worldwide. Method: We will use acoustic radiation force to generate waves in the transplanted liver and then measure the wave propagation with high frame rate ultrasound imaging. We will analyze the resulting wave motion data and evaluate the shear wave velocity and attenuation at multiple frequencies and compare the results with clinical findings of presence of acute cellular rejection. Approach: To achieve these important goals we will conduct a program with the following two coordinated Specific Aims: 1) To compare ultrasound measurements of shear wave velocity and attenuation in post-transplant liver patients to clinical diagnosis, 2) To study changes in mechanical properties of transplanted livers with acute cellular rejection due to medications and treatment."

The major projects will be: Project 1, pathways and mechanisms repressing D4Z4 repeats (Silvere van der Maarel), will identify the molecular mechanisms of repeat element repression. Project 2, repeat derepression and RNA-mediated toxicity in FSHD (Robert Bradley), will determine the molecular consequences and RNA-toxicity associated with de-repression of repetitive elements in the genome. Project 3, targeting the D4Z4 sequence to enhance repeat repression (Stephen Tapscott), will identify mechanisms of enhancing repeat-mediated epigenetic repression as a therapy for FSHD. The Bioresources Core, resources for FSHD research and clinical trials (Rabi Tawil), will provide biological resources necessary for each project and to prepare for clinical trials through development of outcomes measures, including biomarkers and patient assessments. The Administrative Core (Stephen Tapscott) will coordinate the activities and communications among the investigators and provide budgetary and administrative oversight, and coordinate the scientific oversight provided by the External Advisory Board. Together these three Projects and two Cores will address the mechanisms and pathways that converge to epigenetically silence D4Z4 in the repeat-mediated silencing pathways, determine the pathophysiologic consequences of inefficient silencing of repetitive RNAs and accumulation of aberrant RNAs, exploit new opportunities for therapeutic development, and provide the resources necessary for moving studies toward clinical trials."
"8999874","Core 005 - Basic - Project Summary/Abstract - Genomics High-Throughput Facility (GHTF)  A revolution has occurred in biomedicine in which genomics information is enabling faster and more accurate  diagnoses and precise tailoring of therapeutics to patients. This revolution was triggered by developments in  space age miniaturization of devices to enable high throughput, chemistries and spectroscopic advances for  labeling, and use of computer technologies to advance chip-based products and parallel data processing and  communications to enable personalized computing. This revolution is technology-driven. The first mission of  the Genomics High Throughput Facility (GHTF) as a shared resource of the Chao Family Comprehensive  Cancer Research Center (CFCCC) is to act as a conduit to introduce emerging genomics technologies so that  they can be effectively accessed by the broadest spectrum of researchers. Investment in this shared resource  by the CFCCC has been leveraged by nationally-funded instrument grants and campus cost-sharing. These  investments have made Affymetrix microarrays, Illumina HiSeq next generation sequencing and PacBio third  generation sequencing available to cancer researchers within one or two years of introduction to the  workspace--long before they were commercially available for experimentally-tailored formats. These  technologies enabled state-of-the-art research which has translated in a very short time into identification of  unexpected roles for transcription factors, alternative splicing and polyadenylation by Cancer Center  researchers. Introduction of the technologies at the campus level has the additional value of stimulating  collaborations and feedback into further interdisciplinary development of these technologies. The second  mission of the GHTF is to train a new generation of researchers in the analysis of genomics data. In the current  funding period, DNA sequencing analysis pipelines for HiSeq and PacBio sequencing were established. A  Bioinformatics Consulting Service was implemented to insure impact of these data on cancer research. Key  future development priorities for CFCC researchers by the GHTF are: 1) development of a single-cell analysis  platform and 2) expansion of bioinformatics training and analysis. Tumor populations are heterogeneous  collections of cells and that to study them effectively requires the ability to discriminate among them. GHTF will  introduce a microfluidic system for preparation of sequencing libraries from individual cells. The ability to  analyze large streams of data is arguably now the limiting technology for application of genomics to cancer  research. We made substantial progress in this area in the current funding period and now will expand these  efforts with longer and more specialized workshops tailored to beginning and advanced applications, additional  staff time for bioinformatics, and access to cancer-related pathway databases."
"8999525","PROJECT SUMMARY (Biospecimen and Pathology Core)  The translational research proposed in the MD Anderson Cancer Center Prostate Cancer SPORE requires a  broad range of comprehensive support. The Biospecimen and Pathology Core supports investigators by  providing (1) a biospecimen resource with clinically and pathologically annotated biospecimens that  encompass the clinical spectrum of prostate cancer; (2) clinically relevant patient-derived xenografts reflective  of the clinical challenges addressed in the projects; (3) clinical and laboratory personnel experienced in the  conduct, collection, and processing of specimens from clinical trials; and (4) dedicated pathologists and  clinicians with technical expertise who will conduct and interpret tissue-based studies and coordinate all core  activities. To maximize analyses using small samples and enhance collaboration among investigators at MD  Anderson and other institutions, Core personnel will prepare and distribute tissue derivatives linked with  specific disease states. Close collaboration with investigators and electronic processing of requests for  biospecimens and clinical information by the Tissue Acquisition and Distribution Committee will ensure the  evolving needs of each project will be met in a timely manner. In addition, the Core?s Prometheus informatics  staff will manage the repository for clinical and translational data so that investigators will have the full power of  detailed, well-curated clinical annotations essential to maximizing the information gained from often small  samples. The Prometheus system also facilitates the interpretation of analyses within specific clinical and  biologic contexts and enhances interactions among projects. Other functions of Prometheus are to ensure  common data format and ontologic term usage, data integrity, audit history, and data security. Prometheus will  also facilitate future data exchanges with investigators and SPOREs at other institutions. Finally, Prometheus  will enable all statistical analyses performed in the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to be carried out using  the most up-to-date clinical and translational data."
"9353040","Data from fluid biomarker studies have been critical for defining Alzheimer disease (AD) as a continuum, with pathology developing decades prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms which eventually progress to dementia at the end stage of the disease. This concept is impacting disease nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, prognostic potential, and clinical trial design. Revisions in diagnostic criteria to incorporate biomarker results have recently been proposed in order to increase the confidence of AD as the underlying etiology of a clinical impairment and to permit a diagnosis of AD across the disease continuum, eventually perhaps in the asymptomatic period. Individuals in this ?preclinical? stage are receiving intense focus as a targeted population for secondary prevention trials aimed at identifying disease-modifying therapies that have the best chance of preserving normal cognitive function. The ACS Biomarker Core (Core C) implements well-established and efficient workflows and standard operating procedures for the standardized collection, storage, tracking and sharing of fasted CSF and plasma samples and associated data. Data from samples obtained to date have identified biomarker abnormalities that characterize preclinical AD and have shed preliminary light on the rates of change of these biomarkers in relation to their clinical consequences (i.e., progression from cognitive normality to abnormality). Having already obtained CSF and plasma samples (>600 each) from 337 unique ACS participants (longitudinal samples from 187) who are largely middle-aged, through continued collection of samples (and providing them to Project 2 and other qualified investigators), we will be able to assess whether the biomarker changes initially observed during middle-age are predictive of greater rates of change at older ages and ultimately cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Furthermore, as one of the leading groups in fluid biomarker discovery and world-wide standardization efforts, we will continue to participate in ongoing and future collaborative (and internal) projects involving the performance of current and future biomarker candidates and their assays. Aim 1. Continue to maintain and grow a biorepository of fasted CSF and plasma for present and future studies of aging and AD. Aim 2. Coordinate the distribution of CSF and plasma samples to qualified investigators. Aim 3. Participate in studies regarding fluid biomarker assay development/validation and protocol quality control and standardization efforts."

"9228748","Abstract: In the last ten years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although studies using patient samples and/or rodent cell lines suggest that some SNPs affect genes that are involved in pancreatic beta cell function and survival, the exact role of these SNPs in human pancreatic beta cell remains controversial and the mechanistic nature of these SNPs are largely unknown. This is mainly due to limitations of current model systems. For example, there is large batch-to-batch variation among primary patient islets and the species difference limits the application of rodent cell lines or animal models to determine the role of these SNPs in human pancreatic beta cell function. Thus, there is an emergent need to establish a novel system to study SNPs using disease relevant cell types. Stepwise differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), provides an in vitro system to study human embryonic development, as well as the cells to study the role of genetic factors in human diseases. Here, we propose to use isogenic hESCs carrying the diabetes associated SNPs (D-SNP- hESCs) and isogenic hESCs in which diabetes associated genes are knocked out (D-KO-hESCs) to systematically study the role of these SNPs in human pancreatic beta cell development, function, survival and proliferation in both healthy and disease conditions. Understanding the role of these SNPs will significantly enhance our knowledge of genotype to phenotype in diabetes, which will pave the way to the development of drugs for precise therapy of metabolic diseases. In preliminary studies, we have developed 4 isogenic D-SNP-hESCs and 6 isogenic biallelic and monoallelic D- KO-hESCs lines based on INSGFP/W MEL-1 cells. In addition, we have established an efficient strategy to derive glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells from hESCs. Moreover, we found that PTPN2-/- and rs2542151T/T insulin-expressing cells show increased cell death upon cytokine exposure. Finally, we performed a high content chemical screening using hESCPTPN2-/--derived cells and identified a Wnt inhibitor to correct PTPN2-/- specific hypersensitivity to cytokine treatment. Here, we propose to systematically study the step-wise differentiation of these isogenic D-SNP-hESCs and D-KO-hESCs, define the function of the insulin-secreting cells derived from wild type (wt), mutant and KO hESCs, and explore the functional, proliferation and survival of the insulin-secreting cells in disease condition. Finally, we will explore the mechanistic nature of these SNPs. The proposed study will not only provide novel insights into the role of SNPs in human pancreatic beta cell generation and function, but also provide a platform to evaluate new methods or drug candidates for precision therapy of diabetes. Toward this goal, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1: Determine the role of SNPs and gene KO in the generation and function of human pancreatic beta cells. Aim 2: Define the role of SNPs and gene KO in human pancreatic beta cell function and survival in disease conditions. Aim 3. Decode the mechanistic nature of SNPs and identify the small molecules rescuing SNPs or mutations specific beta cell dysfunction."

"9135127","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches."
"9071968","SUMMARY ? PROJECT 1: SIAH1 IN ER AND MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION AND HOMEOSTASIS IN  MELANOMA     Growing evidence indicates that activation of the adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs in  melanoma cells following drug therapy. The UPR senses oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and  dynamics and resolve protein misfolding in the ER, activities often deregulated in melanoma tumor cells.  Notably, the degree of UPR signaling differs among melanoma subtypes, which is consistent with tumor  heterogeneity and plasticity and underlies the propensity to adapt to chemotherapy and related stress stimuli.  More recently, tumor resistance has been associated with altered expression and activity of the master  regulators PGC1? and MITF, factors central for mitochondrial and melanocyte/melanoma biogenesis,  respectively. Recent studies, including our preliminary results, demonstrate that deregulation of effectors of the  UPR, including ATF4, CHOP and IRE1?, plays a fundamental role in melanoma. Work supported by this P01  established that the ubiquitin ligases Siah1/2 are critical to amplify UPR signaling and identified Siah1 isoform  2 (Siah1is2) as the major isoform induced by the BRAFi (PLX4032) and correlated with PGC1? and MITF  expression. Our emerging model is that Siah1is2 is a key sensor that finely tunes the ATF4?IRE1? regulatory  axis to control PGC1? and MITF activities, key elements in the propensity of melanoma to adapt to  environmental conditions associated with drug resistance and metastatic capacity. Efforts coordinated with  Projects 2 and 3 and Cores B and C will further define regulation of PGC1? and MITF expression and activity  and evaluate the contribution of ATF4, CHOP, and Siah1is2 to therapeutic responses. To test the hypothesis  that UPR- and Siah1is2-controlled signaling engages and fine-tunes the PGC1? and MITF regulatory  network to alter metabolic and transcriptional programs, which underlie melanoma resistance and  metastasis. We proposed to determine (i) how does Siah1is2 control of the ATF4?PGC1??MITF regulatory  axis define melanoma resistance and metastatic phenotypes and (ii) how does ATF4/CHOP regulate  melanoma metastasis and drug resistance? Our studies will rely on congenic melanoma tumors, naive or  resistant to therapy, congenic Braf/Pten derived melanoma lines CRSPER'd for UPR and Siah1is2 genes, and  genetic melanoma models crossed with Atf4, Chop or Siah1 mutant animals. Our studies are expected to  lead to unprecedented new insight into the precise role select UPR components play in control of  melanoma plasticity, underlying its propensity to resistance and metastatic phenotypes?which  represent a key unmet clinical need."

The Salk Institute has  for many years been home to a visual neuroscience community that has been highly productive and progressive in its approach, with an unusual degree of collaboration on topics of shared interest. This community now comprises the Center for the Neurobiology of Vision (CNV), which includes research programs that employ a variety of experimental approaches - molecular, genetic, cellular, systems, and computational - and address the neural structures and events that underlie visual sensation, perception, cognition, visually-guided behavior, visual plasticity,  learning, memory and development. The eleven training faculty of the CNV collectively boast a lengthy, diverse and highly successful record of visual neuroscience training of both pre- and postdoctoral students. The proposed training program will place emphasis on research projects that are interdisciplinary, explore visual system organization and function across levels ranging from molecules to behavior, address multiple stages in the processing hierarchy and enable understanding of pathologies of visual function. The administrative structure of the proposed program comprises an Executive Committee with director T. Albright and committee members (E. Callaway, H. Cline, D. O'Leary, and T. Sejnowski) representative of our research strengths: neural correlates of perception, neuronal circuits and mechanisms, development and plasticity, and disorders of visual function. Training will be provided to four trainees for one to two years and designed toward exposure of a range of modern techniques including electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, fMRI, psychophysics, molecular genetics, and theory/computational modeling. In view of the high quality of postdoctoral applicants to our program, the consistent successes of current and past trainees, and diminishing private funds for training in visual neuroscience, we are requesting support for four postdoctoral trainees, which will ensure the maintenance of this training and leverage the productivity of our NEI-supported research programs."
"9264163","Project description  Astrocytes are found throughout the mammalian brain and interact spatially and functionally with neurons, blood vessels and other glia. They serve multiple homeostatic functions and are involved in synapse formation, removal and regulation. One long standing and major open question concerns how astrocytes communicate with other cells such as neurons, microglia and astrocytes. From this perspective, much attention has focussed on extracellular ATP, which is released from neurons, astrocytes and multiple other cells by several mechanisms. Once released, ATP activates a family of ionotropic and metabotropic ATP receptors, and its degradation product activates adenosine receptors. However, it has proven extremely challenging to measure extracellular ATP levels directly and much of our knowledge about ATP signaling in the brain is based on pharmacological and genetic interventions targeting ATP receptors. Hence, the release, concentration, dynamics and spread of ATP in living brain tissue has hardly been explored, despite the fact that it is implicated widely in astrocyte-glial and astrocyte-neuron interactions. Buoyed by significant advances in the design and use of genetically-encoded glutamate sensors, we set out to design and characterise a genetically-encoded sensor for extracellular ATP. In the preliminary data of this application we report an intensity-based ATP-sensing fluorescent reporter (iATPSnFR). iATPSnFR is expressed on cell surfaces and responds to expected extracellular ATP concentrations with an increase in fluorescence intensity of an appropriately attached circularly permuted super folder GFP (cpSFGFP). iATPSnFR can be genetically targeted to specific cell types and imaged with standard epifluoresence and confocal microscopes. The use of iATPsNFR will shed light on the cells releasing ATP and reveal when, where and how astrocytes receive ATP signals during physiological and pathophysiological processes. We expect that iATPSnFR will permit the measurement and tracking of extracellular ATP dynamics directly for the first time. Although we focus on astrocytes, iATPsNFR can be applied to any cell type. In this proposal we have two specific aims with which we seek to develop our new approach and provide important, new, broadly applicable and much needed resources for astrocyte and ATP signalling research."
"9235747","Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of renal failure in the US. Hyperglycemia (HG) has been identified as the primary risk factor for DN, but therapies targeting the known pathways of HG-induced renal damage have not shown significant benefits. We proposed endogenous protective mechanisms exist which mitigate the adverse effects of HG that contribute to DN development. Examination of a unique cohort of type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients (Joslin Medalist Study; n=1007) who have had the disease for 50?87 years, of whom only 13.2% have significant renal disease independent of HbA1c support this conclusion. Proteomic analysis of Medalists' post-mortem renal glomeruli, comparing DN class 0-I to IIB ?III identified multiple enzymes in the glycolytic, aldose reductase, methylglyoxal (MG) and mitochondrial pathways as higher in those protected from DN. Additionally, metabolomic analyses comparing those with DN (eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2) and those without (eGFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m2) showed many glycolytic intermediates, sorbitol, MG and DAG to be decreased. This suggests an ability to metabolize intracellular glucose via glycolysis, the aldose reductase pathway, MG degradation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. A subset comparison of metabolites from Medalists' without DN to younger individuals who progressed rapidly to DN supports PKM2's protective nature. Plasma PKM2 levels from the Medalists correlated with eGFR, MG and DN class. Therefore, activating the key regulatory allosteric glycolytic enzyme, pyruvate kinase (PK), especially the M2 isoform, may increase flux via glycolysis and the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways and prevent the onset or stop DN progression. We have documented PKM2 activation reversed HG-induced elevations of diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, sorbitol, MG, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as apoptosis in podocytes. Further, knockdown of PKM2 exaggerated the toxic effects of HG. In vivo studies using a small molecule activator of PKM2 and PKM2 podocyte specific knock-outs support the importance of PKM2 to normalize mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and prevent pathology of DN in the presence of HG. These data indicate increases in glycolysis and mitochondrial function, possibly by PKM2 activation, can prevent renal damage due to HG. Specific Aim 1: Validate and reproduce the association of glomeruli PKM2 protein levels with renal cortex and serum metabolite levels in post-mortem glomerular specimens from Medalists to establish a relationship with PKM2 plasma levels and clinical markers of renal function. Specific Aim 2: Compare plasma PKM2 levels, serum metabolite profiles and clinical renal markers in samples from the Medalist population and in a shorter duration population, and establish a longitudinal relationship with PKM2 levels and the progression of renal disease. Specific Aim 3: Characterize the mechanism that causes the decreased expression or activities of PKM2 by HG and the effect of its activation to restore mitochondria and cellular function, and survival of podocytes in HG conditions."
"9250400","PROJECT SUMMARY Conventional treatment for conductive hearing loss normally includes hearing aids or middle ear surgery, which restores movement or continuity of the ossicular chain. However, in cases where conventional surgery is unsuitable or unsuccessful, instead of relying on sound transduction via the normal path involving the ossicular chain and the oval window, round window (RW) stimulation has been attempted with some success. A current issue with RW stimulation is the large variability in efficacy of the device between patients. The effective coupling of the device to the RW membrane has a big influence on the transmission of motion from the device to the inner ear, and may therefore affect the success of an implant. Secondly, difference in the anatomy of inner ear structures may also affect the efficacy of a device by providing paths for acoustic leak along the cochlea. Therefore, understanding the variability and significance of middle ear anatomy (for device-RW coupling interface) and inner ear structures (to further fundamental scientific knowledge on RW stimulation) is essential in the effort to improve current devices. To achieve these goals, we have three main aims. We will comprehensively study the anatomy with cadaveric whole specimens as well as histological temporal bone slide sections in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will develop and test an effective RW stimulation device that will safely and efficiently couple the device vibration to the inner-ear. This will be tested on cadaveric human temporal bones by measuring the stapes velocity and changes in inner ear pressures in response to the stimulation at the RW. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a computational model utilizing the calculated impedance obtained by our experiment measurements, to aid in understanding the mechanism of RW stimulation. This model will account for the impedances both in air conduction stimulation and RW stimulation. Overall, the proposed middle and inner ear research in fresh human cadaveric specimens will provide new and thorough understanding of the RW and develop a detailed impedance model of the human cochlea. The proposed research can lead to a safe and effective RW stimulation device that will improve hearing and quality of life for patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss."

"9353967","In recent years, a photoreceptor system besides rods and cones has been discovered in the mammalian retina, consisting of a sub-population of retinal ganglion cells that express the visual pigment, melanopsin, and are intrinsically-photosensitive (ipRGCs). These ipRGCs comprise distinct subtypes. M1 cells have the strongest melanopsin-immunoreactivity, the highest intrinsic photosensitivity, and the largest saturated light response. M2 and M3 cells have weaker melanopsin-immunoreactivities, lower photosensitivities, and much smaller saturated light responses. M1, M2 and M3 cells also differ in the location of their dendritic arborizations in the inner plexiform layer of the retina. IpRGCs project predominantly to nonimage- vision centers in the brain (e.g., most M1 cells), but they also project moderately to image-vision centers (e.g., many M2 cells). Finally, there are supposedly M4 and M5 ipRGCs, but these are not detectable with melanopsin-immunoreactivity, and have extremely low photosensitivities and small light responses. This proposal deals only with M1-M3 ipRGCs, which may have differential functions with respect to both non-image and image vision. In order to fully understand the melanopsin system, it is important to know in detail the ipRGCs? light responses and their underlying mechanisms. We have recently carried out extensive physiological/biophysical studies of M1 cells, and succeeded in resolving their single-photon response, estimating their melanopsin density, and molecularly identifying some of their key phototransduction components. This grant will be a continuation of these successful investigations. Aim 1 is to study M2 and M3 ipRGCs with respect to their intensity-response relations, response kinetics, single-photon-responses, membrane melanopsin densities, and their light-signaling thresholds, with the overall goal of comparing/contrasting M1, M2 and M3 cells. Aim 2 is to identify additional molecular components of phototransduction across M1, M2 and M3 cells, including the signaling G protein. We shall also examine the gating mechanism for the TRPC channels underlying the light response. Aim 3 is to begin to understand the termination mechanisms for the ipRGC?s light response, including the significance of potential melanopsin phosphorylation, arrestin binding to melanopsin, and Gprotein deactivation. Aim 4 is to study how M1, M2 and M3 ipRGCs adapt to steady light, and how this adaptation in the receptor current translates into action-potential firing and therefore signaling to the brain. We shall also investigate the involvement of Ca2+ in light adaptation. In summary, ipRGCs are the only known non-rod/non-cone photoreceptors in the mammalian retina. They are important for non-image vision and apparently also for subtle aspects of image vision. Therefore, learning in detail how they function is of fundamental importance to vision in both health and disease."

"9128271","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a major public health burden in the US, with current prevalence estimates of 1 in 68 children and economic costs exceed $60 billion per year. Identification of causes that can inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to stem the tide of this rising prevalence. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of autism, however, recent twin and population-scale studies have shown that both genes and environmental exposures contribute equally to ASD risk and etiology. Evidence suggests the critical exposure window is most likely during in utero development, and thus focus on prenatal risk factors is extremely important. Environmental epidemiology has long recognized the neurotoxic effects of exposure to heavy metals, and some air pollution studies have specifically implicated exposure to metals during pregnancy as a risk factor for ASD. However, further assessment of risk due to prenatal metals exposure has been limited by (1) lack of prospective data from pregnancy; (2) lack of direct measures of biologically effective dose; (3) lack of consideration of maternal or child genetic susceptibility; (4) lack of fully characterized ASD phenotypes. Here we propose the first prospective, longitudinal study examining the contribution of prenatal exposure to lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and manganese (Mn) on ASD risk, while accounting for potential genetic modification of metal exposure-ASD associations, using data from 456 mother-child dyads from the two largest enriched risk, prospective, longitudinal pregnancy autism cohorts in the US: Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk in Bablies Learning the Early Signs (MARBLES). Our aims are to: (1) estimate prospective associations between direct measures of perinatal Pb, Cd, Hg, Se, and Mn levels, and ASD outcomes, including ASD-related quantitative neurodevelopmental phenotypes; (2) Incorporate maternal and child genetic susceptibility into analyses that estimate this risk; (3) Examine the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in any detected metals associations, either as a birth biomarker of prenatal exposure, or as a mediator of risk effects. This study is likely to impact the field of autism and contribute to the advancement of human public health because it will: a) establish the relevance of prenatal metal exposures to ASD risk; b) determine whether prenatal metal exposure susceptibility differs based on underlying maternal or child genetic structure; c) potentially inform pathways and biological mechanisms, i.e. epigenetics, involved in disease and/or prenatal exposure processes; and d) generate unified GWAS, epigenetic, and metal measurement data across the 2 largest US longitudinal pregnancy autism cohorts that can be used in future investigations of health outcomes and/or additional exposure domains."

We have recently established a mouse model of aging that will allow us to determine the mechanisms of ciliary slowing. Our supporting data suggest that increases in protein kinase C epsilon (PKC?) activity and expression of PKC? protein play a role in the slowing of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) with age. Aging is a pleotropic, complex process that can vary greatly from individual to individual. We wanted to focus on how one hallmark of aging, DNA damage, affects CBF. In addition, DNA strand breaks also play a role. We hypothesize that normal aging leads to DNA strand breaks, and elevated PKC? signaling, resulting in dysfunctional mucociliary clearance. We will test this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) Establish that elevated PKC? signaling slows CBF in aging, and then restore normal CBF by inhibiting this pathway. 2) Determine how double-stranded DNA breaks, a hallmark of aging, affect CBF. 3) Demonstrate that CBF is slowed in aging humans and determine the role of both double- stranded DNA breaks and PKC? in slowing CBF."
"9172997","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy contribute significantly to the disease burden of epilepsy, a problem which is now increasingly recognized by clinicians, scientists, patient advocacy groups and the federal government. Indeed, 40% of patients with epilepsy suffer from stress-related psychopathologies such as anxiety and depression. Animal models of epilepsy corroborate clinical observations, evident as an array of depressive and anxiety-like phenotypes. Together these observations are suggestive of a common etiological mechanism that may influence disease progression of epilepsy itself and of its comorbidities. Recent clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that abnormalities in the stress system may contribute to epilepsy development and progression, as well as the development of psychiatric comorbidities. To date, however, very few mechanistic studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between stress hormone dysregulation and the development of epilepsy or its comorbidities.           Patients and animals with epilepsy exhibit chronic hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary­adrenocortical (HPA) axis, which regulates the stress response, resulting in chronically  elevated glucocorticoids and over-activation of glucocorticoid receptors; a feature shared with major depression. Elevated glucocorticoids can damage neurons, increase brain excitability (pro-convulsant) and induce depressive symptoms in rodents and people. Thus we propose that HPA axis dysfunction in epilepsy contributes to disease progression and the development of psychiatric comorbidities. Our guiding hypothesis, therefore, is that the comorbid development of epilepsy and depression is mediated by chronic hyper-activation of the glucocorticoid stress receptor (GR).           We will test this hypothesis utilizing the well-characterized pilocarpine mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In these animals, we will temporally and conditionally delete the glucocorticoid receptor in forebrain regions implicated in epilepsy and stress-regulation. We predict that such temporal and region-specific glucocorticoid receptor deletion will have disease modifying effects in epilepsy, evident as reduced seizures and reduced comorbid depressive-like behaviors. These studies will lay the groundwork for developing a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between stress and epilepsy, and will aid in the development of novel therapies."
"9352918","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Corneal scarring and neovascularization (NV) following injury, trauma or infection affect 1.5 million Americans each year and are the 3rd leading cause of global blindness. Our central hypothesis is that decorin is the key regulator of corneal stromal wound healing, and that tissue-targeted localized delivery of therapeutic genes treats corneal disorders without significant side effects. Our long-term goal continues to be the development of tissue-targeted gene therapy approaches for corneal diseases in humans. We have recently developed targeted in vivo corneal gene therapy approaches using the adeno-associated vector (AAV) and simple topical delivery techniques. We found that localized AAV-decorin (AAV-dcn) therapy inhibits corneal scarring in vivo in rabbits without acute toxicity. Aim-1 of this proposal will test the hypotheses that targeted AAV-dcn therapy of rabbit keratocytes in vivo (a) inhibits their migration and proliferation by internalizing/ degrading epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and (b) limits myofibroblast formation by blocking transforming growth factor-? (TGF?) signaling without interfering with stromal collagen fibrillogenesis, which is critical for transparency. Further, we found that AAV-dcn decreases angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and NV in rabbit corneas in vivo. The literature shows that VEGF-mediated angiogenesis can be counteracted by pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF). This prompted us to hypothesize that combined decorin and PEDF delivery into rabbit keratocytes by AAV limits excess stromal healing, restores the cornea's normal physiological balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, and eliminates corneal NV and concurrent scarring in vivo without adverse effects. Aim-2 will test this hypothesis by evaluating the efficacy and safety of localized topical combination (AAV-dcn+AAV-PEDF) therapy using an established rabbit alkali-burn induced in vivo corneal NV and scarring pathological model. Aim-3 will characterize molecular mechanisms by testing the hypothesis that AAV-dcn+AAV-PEDF therapy utilizes a dual mechanism wherein (1) PEDF eliminates corneal NV via Fas/Fas-ligand apoptosis; and (2) decorin inhibits NV by binding VEGFR2 and reducing VEGF-mediated ERK1/2 signaling, and further eliminates corneal scarring by blocking EGFR and TGF?. We will accomplish these aims using human corneal fibroblasts, decorin knockout mice, a rabbit photorefractive keratectomy-induced corneal fibrosis model, an alkaline burn induced corneal NV and scarring pathological model, topical AAV gene transfer, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, qPCR, apoptosis TUNEL assay, morphometric, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Successful completion of the proposed research will significantly advance the development of gene-based treatments for corneal NV and scarring, identify cornea-specific key fundamental mechanisms, and fill in gaps in our knowledge. Furthermore, our gene therapy approaches have a potential application in curing diseases in other tissues as AAV-dcn significantly inhibited peritoneum fibrosis in our collaborative studies with other scientists."
"9202058","Project Summary Repair of pectus excavatum (sunken Chest) currently involves a major surgical repair accompanied by a 3-7 day post-operative hospital stay and outpatient treatment with prescription pain medication. We have created the Magnetic Mini-Mover System which utilizes magnetic force to reconfigure the patient's abnormal chest. The implanted magnet is placed during a 30-60 minute outpatient procedure and the patient usually goes home the same day on over-the-counter pain medication. The Magnetic Mini Mover System was most effective in treating the Pectus deformity in pre-pubertal patients but less effective in older teens with more rigid chest walls, so in the second trial we treated only pre pubertal patients. The device has been trialed in 25 patients where the concept works, but the means to anchor the implant to the sternum has proven problematic. The Magnetic Mimi Mover Device, currently consists of a neodymium iron boron disc magnet, (1.5 cm diameter x 3/16 in. thick) and a ferromagnetic focusing plate encased in a low-profile titanium shell. It is held in place on the sternum using woven titanium cables and a titanium backing plate. The cable is titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V ELI) of 7 wire strands wrapped into a cable then 7 cables each 0.0065? are wrapped together to given a woven cable of 0.05940? and 15.875? in length. This configuration was developed for commercially available orthopedic titanium cables. The external custom brace houses another rare- earth magnet that can be adjusted using a plastic housing built into the orthotic brace. Adjustments in the magnets distances will slowly pull the chest out over 24-36 months in a process similar to that used in orthodontics. The device is patented (US 8043290) and we are filing for modifications to the new design as well as the external brace. It has also and has obtained a Humanitarian Use Designation (08- 0200) from the FDA. We have completed our 1st clinical trial and in the midst of a 2nd multi- centered funded by the Office of Orphan Products at the FDA. In both trials we have had a difficulty designing the internal magnet, specifically attaching it to the sternum and developing a universal shape for both symmetrical and asymmetrical sternums. However the chest repairs were successful due to the encapsulation of the device on sternum. We are requesting funds to modify the design of the implanted magnet housing and the means of attaching it to the sternum. This will be the third and potentially the last design iteration before commercialization. During the last trial we learned the importance of including the effects of patient respirations as a test to determine the strength and viability of the implant. This study will evaluate and create: 1. A means to quantify the effects of patient respirations on the design of the new device 2. A locking mechanism on the implant that will best remain immovableof implant will best  remain immovable on the sternum 3. A mechanism that will not injure the bone and cartilage on the sternum, 4. A mechanism fit best onto the bone disorder most noticeable on the sternum during the  course of the two year trial."

"9261198","Abstract In the 50 years after publication of Bradford Hill?s ?criteria? for inferring causality, an enormous amount of data has accumulated in epidemiology, and refined methods for examining evidence have been developed. Considering the importance of the ?criteria? in public health decision making, it is timely to re-assess their utility for distinguishing association from causality. As a group of scientists from Brunel University London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Royal Society of Medicine we are organizing a workshop with high profile international speakers to re-assess Bradford Hill?s legacy in the light of today?s knowledge about multi-causality. The ambition is to evaluate and, if needed, update the Bradford Hill paper. The event will be held on 13- 14 Oct 2016 at the very venue of his famous lecture, the Royal Society of Medicine in London. Kenneth Rothman, Kurt Straif, Paolo Vineis, Sir Richard Peto, Dame Valerie Beral and others will participate. We are seeking £8,000 to cover the travel costs of speakers, so that the attendance fee for workshop participants can be kept affordable. To maximize the impact of the workshop we aim to disseminate workshop outcomes in a high impact journal."
"9072857","ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this project is to develop novel statistical methods for integrative analysis of genomic data in  cancer research. We propose to develop analytical tools that can integrate data from multiple genomic  platforms and incorporate external omic information from publically available databases. These tools will be  applicable to both etiological studies geared toward causal discovery and to clinical and translational studies  geared toward predictive modeling.  Advances in high-throughput molecular technologies have enabled large-scale omic projects (e.g. Encode, The  Cancer Genome Atlas, Epigenome Roadmap) to generate vast amounts of information on the structure,  function and regulation of the genome. In addition to this publically available data, individual studies are  increasingly generating multiplatform genomic profiles (e.g. genotypes, gene expression, methylation copy  number variation, miRNA) to elucidate the complex mechanisms of cancer development and progression, and  investigate determinants and predictors of health and clinical outcomes. Integration across these multiple  genomic ?dimensions? and incorporation of the available external information can increase the ability to  discovery causal relationships (e.g. Cancer-SNP associations), enhance prediction and prognosis modeling  (e.g. cancer aggressiveness), and provide insights into biological mechanisms. We propose two analytic  approaches aimed at addressing the challenges to effective integration across multiplatform genomic data and  incorporation of external information from omic projects. The first approach (Aim 1) is a Bayesian regression  and feature selection method that can integrate prior omic information in a very flexible manner allowing the  data to `speak for itself' to determine which pieces of external information are relevant for the problem at hand.  The method works with individual-level data and also with meta-analytic summaries, making it well suited for  analyzing data from large multi-study consortia. The second approach (Aim 2) is a regularized regression and  feature selection method for integrating multiplatform genomic features measured on the same set of  individuals. The method is designed to scale to the very large numbers of features typical of genomewide  platforms, to account for the different properties of each genomic data type, and to incorporate relevant  external information to increase efficiency. Both approaches can be applied for causal discovery and for  developing predictive and prognostic models. We will apply our methods to search for novel risk variants in the  CORECT consortium of genome association studies, and to construct a prognostic model of CRC recurrence  based on genomewide expression methylation data in the ColoCare consortium cohort of CRC patients. This  work will provide new tools for analyzing high-dimensional multi-platform genomic that can take  advantage of available external information."

"9078547","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use big data, but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the crowd - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work."
"9220169","Project Summary Glucose is the primary fuel used by the brain. While alternative energy substrates can transiently sustain the brain?s needs during hypoglycemic episodes, glucose-sensing neurons within the brain nonetheless respond to diminishing energy supplies by altering their electrical behavior. This cellular response often has significant ramifications for the electrical activity patterns produced by neural networks assembled from those neurons. In this project, we aim to identify the mechanisms responsible for this heightened glucosensitivity in a brain structure known as the thalamus, and to determine how these mechanisms promote seizures. Our multifaceted approach utilizes calcium imaging and electrophysiological techniques to test the general hypothesis that glucose directly modulates neural circuits in the thalamus to exacerbate seizures. Using our preliminary data as a launching point, we will begin by carrying out experiments designed to (1) directly measure glucose levels in the thalamus while concomitantly recording seizure activity, and (2) selectively modulate glucose handling in the thalamus and measure impact on seizures. Additionally, measurements of neuronal activity in the thalamus during control and fasted conditions will be achieved directly through in vivo calcium imaging approaches as well as by blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals acquired during functional MRI studies. Collectively, these experiments will establish the thalamus, a critical seizure-generating node in the brain, as a glucosensitive structure. In conjunction with our glucose and seizure measurements, we will utilize electrophysiological and imaging techniques in acute brain slice preparations to directly measure the sensitivity of thalamic neurons to glucose. These experiments will be performed both at the cellular and circuit level. The former is achieved by conventional patch clamp recordings, while the latter is achieved in the context of slice models of thalamic seizures; our lab has extensive experience with both. By performing these reductionist experiments, we aim to pinpoint mechanisms within the thalamic circuit that are particularly vulnerable to hypoglycemic conditions. Finally, in our third aim, we will assess the efficacy of anti-seizure drugs on reducing seizure occurrence in fed and hypoglycemic animals. The motivation for this assessment comes from recent calls to consider that strict glucose monitoring and stabilization in patients may be used as a used adjunct therapy for thalamocortical epilepsy treatment. Our preliminary data agrees with this recommendation, and we have the tools to readily test this possibility."
"9160054","Background: In 2011, 721,800 healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were reported in the United States. The hospital environment has been increasingly recognized as an important determinant of HAI acquisition and prevention of HAIs has become a top priority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Terminal cleaning of a patient room is recognized as a critically important process to help prevent HAIs and involves extensive cleaning and disinfection of the room after a patient has been discharged from the room and before the subsequent patient has been admitted to the room. Pulsed xenon ultraviolet light (PX-UV) has been shown to be effective in killing a variety of pathogens including endospores of Clostridium difficile. PX-UV works quickly ? the entire cycle time for use in a hospital room is 15 minutes. To date, the clinical impact of adding PX-UV to terminal cleaning has not been demonstrated in clinical trials with sham controls or in a crossover design. The long-term goal of this project is to establish the efficacy of terminal cleaning plus PX-UV in reducing rates of HAIs due to the following multi-drug resistant oranisms (MDROs): C. difficile, vancomycin- resistant enterococci (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichiae coli producing extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (ESBLs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii. The objective of this application is to conduct a prospective, sham controlled, double-blinded, interventional crossover trial to compare standard terminal cleaning plus PX-UV (intervention) with standard terminal cleaning plus sham PX-UV (control) with crossover at 12 months, following a 6-month washout period. Outcome measures include the rates of HAIs, as well as the recurrence of genetically identical clinical strains of HAIs among patients on study units. The study will be conducted in 2 hospitals covering 16 total hospital units at Detroit Medical Center. Our central hypothesis is that the addition of PX-UV to standard terminal cleaning will be associated with a significant reduction in the rate of HAIs, as well as a reduction in the recovery of genetically identical strains of MDROs. The impact of PX-UV disinfection on rates of HAIs on study units will be determined by comparing rates of HAIs on a) study units where PX-UV is added to standard terminal cleaning practices to b) units where a sham UV disinfection system is added to standard terminal cleaning; and by comparing rates of HAIs on the same medical ward during each of two 12-month phases of a crossover study (one phase when a PX-UV device is added and one when a sham device is added to standard terminal cleaning). At the conclusion of the proposed project, novel data will be generated from this rigorously controlled study regarding the effectiveness of PX-UV in reducing HAIs in a representative, real-world healthcare setting."
"9146678","PROJECT 2: Repeat derepression and RNA-mediated toxicity in FSHD Abstract FSHD is caused by somatic derepression of the normally transcriptionally silent D4Z4 locus and subsequent expression of the disease gene DUX4. The broad and long-term goal of this project is to identify molecular pathways downstream of D4Z4 derepression that may be targeted to slow disease progression or improve muscle function. The major hypothesis of this project is that repetitive and other aberrant RNAs contribute to DUX4 cytotoxicity and modify FSHD severity. The specific goal of the project is to identify the mechanistic origins of aberrant RNA production and cytotoxicity, and determine whether these toxic RNAs modify FSHD penetrance. This will be accomplished by: Aim 1, Determine the molecular mechanisms of DUX4-mediated inhibition of RNA surveillance; Aim 2, Determine the subset of DUX4-induced RNAs that are actively translated, and test whether these aberrant RNAs produce abnormal proteins or novel peptides in DUX4-expressing cells; Aim 3, Determine whether genetic variation influences repetitive RNA expression to modify FSHD penetrance. Together, these aims will identify mechanisms that promote stable expression of repetitive and other aberrant RNAs, thereby contributing to DUX4 toxicity and acting as a novel modifier of FSHD penetrance. The significance of these studies is that they will identify molecular pathways downstream of D4Z4 derepression that mediate DUX4 toxicity and contribute to variable penetrance of FSHD. The health relatedness is that RNA-mediated mechanisms of toxicity may provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention downstream of D4Z4 derepression."
"9139391","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Because intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault (SA) are major public health concerns, primary prevention strategies at all levels of the social ecology are critical. To date, however, there are few community- level IPV and SA prevention efforts that have been developed, implemented, and rigorously evaluated. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of a novel, community-level strategy (i.e., GreenDot Community) for preventing both IPV and SA. A quasi-experimental methodology will be utilized such that two communities will receive no intervention, one community will receive community-based components of GreenDot (i.e., bystander trainings), and two communities will receive the community-based components in addition to capacity building for social marketing campaign and action events hypothesized to be the catalysts of change for collective efficacy and injunctive norms. To evaluate the impacts of the community-level interventions, baseline data will be collected through multiple methods during year one of the grant and post-intervention data will be collected during year four of the grant. Multiple methods of data collection will be utilized and include: random-digit dial survey of adults, a school-based survey of adolescents (in addition to utilization of YRBS data specific to schools in participating communities), observation of hot spots, concept mapping, and content coding of social media sites. Analyses will determine if the community-level intervention leads to reductions in community rates of IPV and SA, in addition to determining the key mediating variables of these outcomes (i.e., increase collective efficacy and shift injunctive norms to be intolerant of gender-based violence) as well as moderation variables (e.g., demographic variables and community readiness). Ultimately the proposed project will shed light on whether a novel community-level IPV and SV prevention effort reduces rates of IPV and SV in communities (as well as mediating and moderating effects of such potential outcomes); if proven effective, GreenDot community could be used by communities across the U.S. in efforts to reduce gender-based violence."
"9233411","Project Background Veterans with PTSD often face a spiral of losses in social functioning and social resources, leading to poor community reintegration. We define community reintegration as activities and participation across a range of life roles, including relationship with spouse/significant other, parenting, education, work, social, leisure, spiritual, civic, self-care, domestic life and economic life. While those who complete evidence-based treatments like Prolonged Exposure (PE) show improvements in social functioning, only 6-11% of Veterans with PTSD start these treatments, and of those, 30-49% drop out. Peer specialists (Veterans who manage mental health challenges and are trained and supervised to support other Veterans in mental health recovery) may provide a way to help more Veterans engage in and complete PE. This research constitutes first steps to learn if supplementing PE with professional peer support may increase the numbers of Veterans who engage in and complete PE; if so, the use of peer support interventions adjunctive to PE may improve rehabilitation outcomes. Project Objectives A multidisciplinary team with expertise in peer support, treatment development, PTSD, qualitative methods, and psychosocial rehabilitation will use Veteran-centered focus group data with existing theory and research to refine an adjunctive intervention called Peer Enhanced Exposure Therapy (PEET). PEET will be designed to improve treatment engagement, treatment adherence, social functioning, and community reintegration among Veterans receiving PE. Aim 1) Refine a preliminary adjunctive intervention manual, training materials, fidelity monitors, and outcome measures for Peer Enhanced Exposure Therapy (PEET) through focus group interviews and expert panel feedback. Aim 2) Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the adjunctive intervention. Project Methods For Aim 1, the team will assemble focus groups for a) Veterans who are currently in or have recently dropped out of PE, and b) VA PE providers. Results from qualitative analysis of focus group content will subsequently be evaluated by experts in PE and peer support, to refine components of the treatment manual. The team will then refine the manual, training materials, fidelity monitors, and outcome measures for PEET. For Aim 2 the team will test the intervention by training 2 peer specialists and implementing the intervention for at least 12 Veterans seeking PE treatment. The intervention will be assessed using a) semi structured interviews from Veterans, PE providers, and peer specialists, b) a trial battery of potential outcome measures, and c) peer specialist performance on knowledge tests, skill performance, and fidelity monitors. Results will be used to a) refine the treatment manual and associated materials and b) support Stage II trials."
"9235532","Project Summary/Abstract Cancer affects not only those with the disease, but also their family members. Family caregivers are known to have compromised health, as the detrimental impact of patients' cancer on their caregivers is substantial. Studies have documented the patient's distress relates to the caregiver's poorer health and vice versa, suggesting that cancer caregivers' health is an interpersonal, dyadic problem. Unknown are when and how the dyadic, cross-over effects occur. Stress regulation among cancer caregivers and their patients is interdependent, as is the caregiver-patient relationship itself. This dyadic stress regulation occurs when members of a dyad mutually calm each other's stress reactions and dampen negative affect and physiological arousal (coregulation) or mutually increasing those outcomes (coagitation). We propose that greater stress coregulation protects against adverse health outcomes, whereas greater stress coagitation exacerbates them. This project will examine dyadic stress regulation between cancer caregivers and their patients, and test coregulation and coagitation as predictors of health outcomes. Coregulation/coagitation will be quantified by cardiovascular (heart rate variability: HRV), neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol), and self-reported affective reactivity and regulation, in response to a standardized stress situation that is relevant both to health and to close relationships. We will then examine prospectively the extent to which the indicators of coregulation for this discrete stressor relate to daily outcomes (mood, diurnal cortisol, and sleep) and interim health outcomes (depressive symptoms, resting HRV, and healthcare visits), and the degree to which gender moderates such effects. A total of 120 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (60 male and 60 female) and their heterosexual caregiver (120 dyads) will participate. Understanding underlying biological and psycholgoical mechanisms is critical for identifying cancer caregivers and their patients who are at most risk for poor health due to their mutual stress regulation patterns. Findings of this project will be readily translated to development of novel interventions pertaining to effective and mutual management of stress in daily life and dyadic influences on health promotion. Those interventions will aim helping one another to better modulate and manage stress and optimizing beneficial effects of coregulation of cancer-related stress on better health. These tailored-and-targeted interventions will help caregivers identify when and how they should engage in stress self-management in the context of illness trajectory of their relative with cancer. They will also aim at reducing premature morbidity and mortality, particularly related to dysregulated cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and immunologic systems, and psychological distress, among persons touched by cancer and other chronic illness, thereby improving public health."
"9133384","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop and evaluate the utility of a novel input camera system for retinal prosthetics that allows users to filter optical imagery based on distance from the observer. We call this depth filtering, which can be accomplished with a depth sensing stereoscopic camera system. Retinal prostheses can restore partial vision to people blinded by outer retinal degenerative diseases such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) or Macular Degeneration. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System is intended to provide electrical stimulation of the retina to elicit visual perception in blind individuals with (near) total visionloss due to retinitis pigmentosa. The implanted epiretinal array provides a 10 x 6 grid of electrodes. Electrical pulses at these 60 pixel sites stimulate the retina's remaining cells and result in the perception of patterns of light. The current spatial resolution is only 60 total pixels, but the camera systems that provide image information to the prosthesis user transmit full-resolution video information. Information in the imagery consists of all visible items within the field of vie ranging for example from nearby obstacles to far away mountain scenery. The lack of perceived spatial resolution makes it extremely difficult for prosthesis users to differentiate between important nearby elements within the scene and relatively unimportant distant elements of the scenery, or vice versa. An image capture and processing system is proposed that selectively removes elements in a viewed scene that are outside a user-set depth range. We hypothesize that system utility in important tasks such as people or object finding and mobility will be less burden some, and performance improved, by providing only relevant visual information to the wearer. The proposed project seeks to develop and experiment with distance-filtered optical imagery as an input modality to retinal implants. Two prototype systems will be specified, designed, built and evaluated in Argus II patients: In phase 1 of the proposed project the image processing will be performed by a computer external to the Argus II system. In phase 2, a more powerful version of the next-generation Argus II video processing unit, capable of performing the image processing, will be utilized. This will be coupled with a new dual camera eyeglass assembly, making the phase 2 prototype fully integrated and ready for commercialization in the next generation Argus II system, and possibly in other visual prosthesis systems and head-mounted electronic low vision aids."
"9238285","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: According to the North Carolina Division of Public Health, 1,101 people died in 2012 from unintentional poisoning in the state, with 92% of all unintentional poisoning deaths drug or medication related. Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) is an evidence-based, safe and effective strategy for decreasing the frequency and quantity of opioid use and reducing the risk of overdose and death. Objective: The core aims for the UNC Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes for Rural Primary Care Medication Assisted Treatment (UNC ECHO for MAT) demonstration project are to: (1) increase understanding about how known barriers to the implementation of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in primary care can be overcome, and (2) evaluate strategies to overcome those barriers; while, we simultaneously expand access to MAT in 22 rural and underserved counties, reducing the risk of accidental overdose deaths through a multi- layered provider and practice engagement strategy. Methods: Using a RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) approach and through a mixed methods study design, we will gather data on the number and representativeness of the primary care providers (PCPs) who agree to participate in the waiver and ECHO tele-trainings and tele-case conferences; assess how many actually start prescribing; evaluate the consistency and quality of MAT, fidelity to MAT guidelines/protocols in terms of dosage, refills, complementary patient education/counseling, and because this is a provider-level demonstration project, effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed indirectly using Medicaid and BCBS claims data. The RE-AIM evaluation will be coupled with qualitative interviews to explore RE-AIM issues (e.g., find out why people did or did not agree to participate and/or adopt MAT, what practice-level implementation issues arose, what intended and unintended consequences resulted, why some maintained and others didn't). Potential Impact: Through a multi-layered provider intervention based on the Project ECHO model and practice level engagement activities, we anticipate 150 new PCPs in 22 rural counties will receive the DATA- 2000 waiver training and 75% will go onto provide MAT. By identifying barriers, and implementing strategies to overcome barriers to effective engagement of rural PCPs in the provision of MAT, we will increase the availability of MAT in rural communities and thereby reduce accidental overdose death rates. The impact will be expanded beyond the target counties and providers through dissemination of information about effective rural PCP recruitment and engagement methods and practice resources developed through the project.  "
"9340489","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging often leads to a functional decline across multiple cognitive domains, but the physiologic and anatomic changes underlying these impairments are not fully understood. A number of changes in hippocampal structure and connectivity are associated with aging including a decline in neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG) and decreased performance on hippocampus-dependent tasks. Levels of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) in the mouse DG increase more than 10-fold between 8 and 52 weeks of age. A similar aging-related increase in BMP4 expression is found in the human DG. Conversely, levels of the BMP inhibitor, noggin, in the mouse DG decrease by about 70% during this time. This results in an extraordinary 30- fold aging-related increase in BMP signaling in the DG measured by levels of phosph-SMAD1/5/8. Reducing BMP signaling in aged mice by either intraventricular infusion or transgenic overexpression of noggin reverses aging-related changes in both neurogenesis and cognition. Conversely, transgenic overexpression or intraventricular infusion of BMP4 in aged mice prevents the beneficial effects of exercise on neurogenesis and cognitive performance. These findings lead to the hypothesis that changes in BMP signaling underlie the decreases in neurogenesis and in hippocampus-dependent behavior associated with aging. To test this hypothesis we will first investigate the cellular and behavioral effects of inducible cre-mediated ablation of BMPRII in the DG neural stem cells (NSCs) of aged mice. To identify BMP targets associated with aging related neural stem cell quiescence, we will perform genomic scale gene expression profiling of NSCs isolated from BMPRII intact and ablated aged mice. Finally, we will define changes in expression and cellular origin of BMP ligands, receptors, and inhibitors in the hippocampus of aging humans and examine correlations between BMP levels, neurogenesis, and age-associated cognitive decline in human. The goal of the studies is to identify specific molecular loci where therapeutic intervention in the aged nervous system may lead to a return to normal neurological function."
"9000519","PROJECT-001: CANCER CONTROL PROGRAM (CC)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The Cancer Control (CC) Program at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC), led  by Electra D. Paskett, PhD, MSPH and Mary Ellen Wewers, RN, PHD, MPH, has 52 members from 19 OSU  departments within the OSU Colleges of Medicine, Public Health, Arts and Sciences, Law, Nursing, Education  and Human Ecology, Dentistry, and Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, as well as Nationwide  Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Program members provide a wealth of behavioral,  basic, clinical, policy, outcomes, and social scientific knowledge and expertise not only to the CC Program, but  to the OSUCCC as a whole. The overall CC Program goal is to conduct research to reduce the incidence,  mortality and morbidity of cancer, which is accomplished by employing a transdisciplinary research team  approach. The Specific Aims of the CC Program are to: 1) Identify molecular, genetic, and behavioral factors  related to cancer incidence and mortality; 2) Develop and test behavioral interventions to prevent or detect  cancer early; and, 3) Assess and intervene on issues of cancer survivorship. An additional developing aim of  the CC Program is to address policy in relation to cancer prevention, detection, and care. Within these aims,  research focuses on cross-cutting themes including underserved/minority populations within our catchment  area, communication research, tobacco use and toxicity (including regulatory science), and behavioral  strategies that capitalize on our members' strengths, such as epidemiology, biology and behavior. The  program now has 2 NCI P50-funded Centers, both showcasing not only our multi-level focus but also the  transition from observational to interventional studies. In addition, many of our interventions, e.g., Patient  Navigation and Bio-Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stress after Breast Cancer, have been incorporated into  clinical care. Moreover, our research has contributed to policy changes, most notably the establishment of a  smoke-free campus at OSU. During this past funding period (2009 - 2014), the Program members published a  total 611 articles in peer-reviewed journals of which 32% have intra-programmatic collaboration, 20% have  inter-programmatic collaborations, and 404 (66%) of the publications represent multi-institutional  collaborations. Many of these publications fall within each of these categories bringing the total collaborative  publications to 85%. CC Program funding stands at $6.8M of which $6.2M is peer-reviewed funding and of  that, $3.9M (63%) is NCI funding. CC Program investigators have enrolled 9,205 participants to research  studies over the last 5 years, 64% to externally peer-reviewed studies and 34% to institutional studies, 1.2% to  cooperative trial group studies and 0.8% to industry studies. Of these, 6,964 (76%) were enrolled on  interventional studies and 2,241 (24%) on non-interventional studies. Future goals focus on increasing  research in: 1) policy, allowing us to take advantage of health care policy initiatives; 2) molecular and genetic  epidemiology and 3) patient outcomes, fostering more inter-programmatic research with clinicians."
"9139388","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): FHI 360, a global nonprofit organization, and the YMCA of the USA propose to conduct an evaluation study of CDC's Heads Up Initiative in Youth Sports. Specifically, the FHI 360 study team will promote Heads Up materials designed for coaches of youth sports, parents, and youth athletes in local YMCA facilities across the country to assess changes in concussion prevention and treatment awareness knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. In addition, administrators of YMCA chapters will be interviewed to collect data on sports policies and practices, to assess any changes from the use of the materials. YMCA facilities will be randomized to receive promotion efforts and distribution of the materials, or a delayed promotion. Study subjects from the two groups of facilities will be compared. FHI 360 and the YMCA of the USA expect that this evaluation study will provide much needed information about how local youth sports leagues prevent and treat concussion, as well as how well Heads Up materials communicate needed information. The study also will provide actionable findings for the YMCA of the USA to use to further promote policies and practices for concussion prevention."
"9144717","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An EHS-Net site is proposed consisting of the three largest governmental jurisdictions within Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the United States. The jurisdictions, responsible for a total of 23,700 fixed retail and mobile food establishments with a combined force of 58 food inspectors, have a support network of a food safety science research program within a large local university, city and county epidemiologists, health educators, audio-visual technologists, public information specialists, and access to state and state laboratories. The site is capable and willing to collect environmental data during foodborne illness outbreak investigations, participate in national EHS-Net studies, and implement its own practice-based research study. To ensure maximum efficiency and effectiveness in its efforts to reduce foodborne illness risk factors in Harris County, the Harris County EHS-Network proposes a non-conventional food safety training technique in the form of behavior modification methods supported by non-verbal and bilingual training aids for small retail food establishment that lack an internal support network to promote and ensure food safety best practices. The research team, including professors experienced in organizational culture and diversity issues, will identify the most prevalent foodborne illness risk factors in a study of small, non-incorporated restaurants, meat markets, flea market food establishments and mobile food establishments in Harris County by administering the FDA foodborne illness risk factor survey, a knowledge-based survey for food managers and food handlers as well as by collecting and analyzing food and environmental samples. An educational toolkit consisting of behavior modification methods and bi-lingual and non-verbal training materials will be created and tested at a sample of the four establishment types. The research team will assess and analyze the effectiveness of the toolkit through re-administration of the knowledge and risk factor surveys after the training intervention, modifying the behavior modification methods and training aids as needed. The educational toolkit will be available through electronic means for simple and fast application by other jurisdictions and managers. The practice-based research in this proposal is significant because developing behavior modification training methods through the use of modeling and non-verbal training aids tailored to meet needs of small food operations with a diverse population of food handlers will help ensure that food safety is not only being learned, but the knowledge is being translated into practice and incorporated into standard operating procedures and into a culture of food safety."
"9144345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quality of surgical care varies widely in the United States, and identifying appropriate quality indicators is essential. Our current paradigm of quality assessment in surgery primarily focuses on clinical outcomes, such as complication rates, mortality, and readmission. This approach effectively captures perioperative safety and technical performance, but overlooks the patient perspective. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as self-reported health status, function, and quality of life, could offer a more complete assessment of quality. However, little is known about their potential as a quality metric. This proposal will explore the determinants of variation in PROs at the hospital and surgeon level, their advantages and limitations as an indicator of quality, and their value and application for patients considering surgery. In addition to the innovative research plan, this proposal will provide the career development candidate (Dr. Jennifer Waljee) with a rich methodological training and mentorship experience. The research proposal focuses specifically on the variation of PROs at the population level for four surgical conditions: bariatric, urologic, wrist, and spine surgery. These conditions were chosen from the regional surgical collaborative quality improvement programs led by the University of Michigan at the Center for Healthcare Outcomes and Policy with funding from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan/Blue Care Network. Each of these collaborative programs gathers clinical and patient-reported data from patients undergoing surgery from each participating hospital, and is a unique clinical laboratory to study PROs across hospitals and surgeons on a population-based level. The proposal's research aims include (1) examining the variation in PROs across hospitals and surgeons, and the patient, surgeon, and hospital-level factors that drive this variation; (2) the extent to which PROs are independent measures of quality compared with clinical outcomes; and (3) the way in which patients might use PROs in conjunction with clinical outcomes as measures of hospital and surgeon performance. This project, the multidisciplinary mentorship team, and the research environment are ideally suited to address the career goals and educational needs of Dr. Waljee. Her prior research experience examining PROs following surgery has prepared her to conduct the work outlined in this proposal. However, to achieve her career goal of improving quality assessment in surgery by integrating patient reported outcomes as performance measures, she will need additional training. Her educational goals, including obtaining expertise in survey research, advanced statistical methods for comparing provider performance, and approaches to healthcare organization and policy, are feasible with the grant's educational plan and highly accomplished mentorship team. This proposal includes graduate-level courses in each educational component as well as interactive research seminars and one-on-one mentorship through project-based learning. In summary, this research project, mentorship team, and educational plan will lay the groundwork for Dr. Waljee to perform ongoing and innovative research to improve quality assessment in surgery, and mature as an independent surgeon scientist."
"9137687","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word high may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences."
"9353489","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research network will be to identify opportunities for later-life reversibility/remediation of phenotypes associated with early life adversity (ELA) by bringing together an international group of senior and junior scientists to foster and facilitate the interdisciplinary research needed to stimulate rapid advances in this field. The network will: (a) promote needed increases in scientific knowledge regarding the array of processes and pathways through which different ELAs (e.g., low socio-economic status [SES], stressful experiences, poor parent-child relationships, maternal nutrition and lifestyle) may similarly or differentially impact later life health and well-being, and (b) leverage evidence from (a) to promote development and evaluation of novel later-life interventions to reverse/reduce risk processes related to ELAs. Specific aims for this network will be to: (1). Build capacity to advance interdisciplinary research exploring the potential for midlife reversibility of or/compensation for risks conferred by ELA by convening biannual international, interdisciplinary meetings of researchers with expertise spanning animal and human research and a shared interest in collaborative work to: (a) foster better understanding of the life-course mechanisms/pathways linking ELA to trajectories of later life health and well-being; (b) develop and test later-life interventions to reduce or even completely reverse risks to health and well-being associated with ELA, and (c) identify resource needs to advance this agenda and devise strategies for their development. (2). Support new research on reversibility/remediation through seed/pilot funding; (3). Bring new researchers into the field by offering opportunities for engagement in network activities, including (a) collaborations on pilot or other projects, (b) participation in network meetings/workshops as affiliated researchers, and (c) funded internships with network researchers; and (4). Pursue active out-reach through dissemination and engagement with the broader research community through: (a) a network website; (b) annual network workshops or symposia at various professional meetings that include disciplinary interests in life-course influences on early adversity, and (c) publishing one or more articles or a special issue on the potential for later-life reversibility/remediation for ELA, focued on potential bio-behavioral or other targets and promising intervention approaches. In accomplishing these aims, the proposed network will (a) contribute significantly to promoting needed theoretical and empirical work to clarify how major ELAs impact adult health and well-being, including addressing unanswered questions regarding the mediators and moderators of these influences at different life- stages and (b) support and promote the interdisciplinary collaborations needed to develop effective interventions for mid- and later life adults that can remediate/reverse and therefore to ameliorate effects of early life adversity."
"9268840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical knowledge is often summarized and structured in the form of annotations of biological entities such as genes, genetic variants, diseases, and pathways. These annotations are fragmented across dozens of data repositories like NCBI Entrez, Ensembl, UniProt, and hundreds (or more) of other specialized databases. While the volume and breadth of annotations is valuable, their fragmentation across many data silos is often frustrating and inefficient. Bioinformaticians everywhere must continuously and repetitively engage in data wrangling in an effort to comprehensively integrate knowledge from all these resources, and these uncoordinated efforts represent an enormous duplication of work. The problem of fragmentation is exacerbated (perhaps even fundamentally caused) by the inability of data providers to efficiently contribute to existing repositories. As a result, annotaion providers must generate new resources in order to host newly-generated annotations that are unavailable in the central repositories. In this proposal, we will create a hybrid solution that combines the high performance of a centralized system with the flexibility and breadth of a federated system. The centralized component will provide high-performance computational infrastructure for the integration, query and access of biological annotations. The technical design of this component will be based on our successful MyGene.info web services (://mygene.info). The federated component builds on our extensive background in crowdsourcing. We will build community infrastructure that allows the small- and medium-scale data wrangling that is already being performed (and repeated) by many scientists to be aggregated into a single big-data resource. Additionally, semantic interoperability will be added to our system to ensure that it will integrate with current and future Linked Data applications."
"9267189","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) will expand the highly successful Undiagnosed Diseases Program of the NIH by increasing access for patients with undiagnosed diseases to the nation's leading clinicians and scientists. Stanford Medicine is uniquely placed to advance the mission of the Undiagnosed Disease Program through the establishment of a Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford (CUDS). We propose a program that will (1) facilitate timely, accurate diagnosis of patients with undiagnosed diseases; (2) advance research into underlying mechanisms of disease; and (3) foster cooperation and collaboration both within and outside the UDN. In Aim 1, patients referred by the Coordinating Center will be evaluated through a protocol including pre-visit video consultation and genetic counseling, a week-long visit during which phenotypic, biochemical, genomic and environmental data will be collected and video conference follow up. Blood will be collected for generation of inducible pluripotent stem cells from patients and relatives. A site-wide Diagnosis Board will review case progress and identify internal and external experts for live or virtual video consultation. Use of a telepresence will enable 'virtual consultation' with experts in specific rare diseases from wherever they are across the world. Aim 2 is focused on genomic analysis that will take advantage of our mature pipeline for genome interpretation and may include Stanford's 'clinical grade' genome capture and sequencing technology. De-identified datasets will be shared across network sites, and with scientific collaborators, using both local and coordinating center computing infrastructure. Genomic data will be analyzed in concert with structured analysis of individual phenotypic characteristics via a phenotype interaction map to narrow the search space for genetic variants of interest. An Informatics Board will review progress on data analysis and determine the need for further investigation including multi-omics data collection and analysis. Aim 3 takes advantage of the walking distance co-localization of Stanford Hospitals with the University labs, which will allow the Undiagnosed Diseases Network to utilize unique Stanford resources such as the Stem Cell Institute and the Human Immune Monitoring Center. A Pathogenesis Board will review progress on determination of pathogenesis in individual cases and identify avenues and experts for exploration of causality of individual variants. Each case and disease hypothesis will be presented at the Center's Molecular Mechanisms of Disease weekly conference which will be recorded for dissemination within the network. Working documents will be shared with other sites on a weekly basis via a secure web portal."
"9227014","This R21 application proposes to develop and test an adaptation of Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT), a naturalistic evidence-based caregiver-implemented communication intervention for young children with language impairment. The culturally and linguistically adapted intervention, EMT en Español, addresses a critical need for evidence-based communication interventions for an underserved population, Spanish-speaking children and their families from low-income households. Spanish-speaking caregivers who have children ages 30 to 42 months evidencing receptive and expressive language delays will be eligible. Caregiver-implemented intervention to support the development of home language is recommended for young children with language impairments; however, there are currently no evidence-based, culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions teaching Spanish-speaking caregivers language support strategies for very young children with significant language delays. The proposed project includes: (a) conducting a randomized trial of EMT en Español, a 4-month home-based intervention, with 40 caregivers and their children with language delays; (b) examination of caregiver use of EMT en Español strategies (responsiveness, matched turns, target talk, expansions, prompting) before intervention, after intervention and 3 months after intervention (c) exploring the impact of intervention on child expressive and receptive vocabulary post-intervention and at the 3 month follow up; and (d) assessing the acceptability, perceived effectiveness, and cultural appropriateness of the intervention. The development of assessment protocols, intervention materials, and caregiver training procedures, together with data on parent and child outcomes from the RTC and the feasibility evaluation will provide the basis for a subsequent, large scale randomized control trial to examine the impact of caregiver-implemented home language intervention on critical long term outcomes including vocabulary, complex syntax, and reading in both Spanish and English for young children with language impairment. This intervention development project addresses the NIH goal of reducing disparities in access to health promoting interventions as well as the NIH research agenda to address the health needs of racial and ethnic minorities, rural and urban poor, in order to improve access to care for underserved populations.  "
"9175038","Project Summary/Abstract: Septins define a novel type of cytoskeletal proteins that are conserved from yeast to humans. Septins form rod-shaped heterooligomeric complexes that polymerize end-to-end into filaments, which are further organized into higher-order structures such as rings, hourglasses, and gauzes. These structures act as a cellular scaffold and/or diffusion barrier to impact diverse cellular functions including cytokinesis, mitosis, cell polarization, cell migration, ciliogenesis, dendritic spine morphogenesis, and spermiogenesis. Mutations in septin genes cause hereditary neuropathy and infertility in humans. Septins are also implicated in tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Thus, understanding septin structure and function is critically important not only for basic science but also for public health. Septins were first discovered in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for their essential role in cytokinesis. Since then, this organism has become the leading model for structure-function analysis of this family of proteins. In budding yeast, septins form an hourglass at the cell division site before cytokinesis, which is converted into a double ring at the onset of cytokinesis. The hourglass acts as a scaffold for actomyosin ring (AMR) assembly and also as a diffusion barrier to restrict cell growth to the daughter cell compartment, whereas the double ring sandwiches the AMR and acts as a diffusion barrier to restrict diffusible factors to the division site during cytokinesis. We have pioneered the analysis of native septin structures and dynamics during the cell cycle using cutting-edge technologies including platinum-replica electron microscopy (PREM), FRAP, photo-activation, photo-conversion, and super-resolution 3D-SIM. In this application, we propose to define the mechanism and function for the regulation of septin high-order assembly by septin-associated kinases (Aim 1). We will also establish the mechanism and function for sumoylation, phosphatase, and anillin-controlled septin reorganization during the cell cycle (Aim 2). The insights gained from our proposed studies will help understand the assembly, regulation, and function of this exciting cytoskeleton in other systems."
"9144775","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Comparative effectiveness studies of medical treatments that are initiated during longitudinal, observational follow-up require advanced statistical methods to account for potential bias due to time-dependent confounding, where confounders may influence selection but also mediate treatment effects. Examples of time-dependent treatment include cardioversion at some point after diagnosis with atrial fibrillation, statin initiation in patients at risk for coronary artery disease, or bariatric surgery in an obese population, where these treatments are observed during longitudinal follow-up of an initially untreated population. As technological advances such as electronic health records make large registries and longitudinal data sources increasingly common, the need for valid, interpretable methods for studies of time-dependent treatment will also increase. Existing methods include marginal structural models, g-estimation and structural nested models, all of which involve parameters and assumptions that are hard to communicate to a non-statistical audience. Alternatively, matching methods create pairs of patients, one of whom initiates treatment at time T and another who doesn't, who are comparable: both eligible for treatment at time T and having a similar covariate history. This creates a pseudo-experiment for every treated patient. The pairs can be combined to create a matched sample and analyzed using standard methods for matched data. On the surface, this approach produces clinically intuitive results that look jus like studies of baseline treatment. That is a tremendous advantage; however, there are important complexities in how to define comparable and eligible patients over time. Thus, many variations have been proposed for specific applications, with unique terminology such as sequential stratification matching, propensity score matching with time-dependent covariates, and balanced risk set matching. Perhaps as a consequence of the diffuse literature in this area, these methods are underutilized in comparative effectiveness research (CER). This project will address these gaps, first by conducting a comprehensive review of longitudinal matching methods, and second by assessing the impact of these methods compared to naïve methods and alternative strategies for time-dependent confounding, when applied to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of statin use in the Framingham Heart Study. Together these aims will facilitate a shift in clinical research paradigms towards the use of appropriate methods for time-dependent confounding, and promote the correct and consistent application of longitudinal matching methods to reduce bias in CER studies of time-dependent treatments."
"9172956","PROJECT DESCRIPTION The ability of glioblastomas to proliferate in an uncontrollable manner and disperse widely within normal brain define the malignant phenotype and make this disease uniformly lethal. We have identified an enzyme that is essential for both glioblastoma invasion and proliferation?Kif11. This enzyme is a molecular motor of the mitotic kinesin family, and is needed both for formation of the mitotic spindle during mitosis as well as for microtubule-based cell motility. Furthermore, it can be inhibited with clinically available drugs that we have shown significantly prolong survival in mouse models of glioblastoma. In this application, we will examine how to optimize the delivery of these drugs to the central nervous system and to identify and overcome the mechanisms tumor cells use to develop resistance to them. Results from these translational studies will be vital to our ongoing efforts at developing Kif11 inhibitors as new and effective therapies for the treatment of glioblastoma."
"9122266","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Written language is a crowning achievement of the human brain: it allows the thoughts of one person to flow into the mind of another despite great time and distance between them. For most readers, this information transfer happens effortlessly. Nevertheless, there are limits to how much text can be understood at once; for instance, you do not yet know what the next sentence says. This project uses a combination of behavioral testing and brain imaging to answer the following questions: Is it possible to recognize two words simultaneously? If not, what internal bottlenecks constrain the processing of printed text? Human observers will make judgments about various aspects of words that are flashed simultaneously on both sides of a computer screen. In addition, the observers will either focus attention on one location or divide attention between words at both locations. While they do that, their brain activity will be recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Of particular interest are the visual areas of the brain, including one that responds selectively to words. Some brain areas may respond less strongly when attention is divided than focused, indicating that those areas play a role in determining behavioral accuracy. Furthermore, by varying the demands of the task, this project will uncover the particular stages of visual word processing-from extracting the features of individual letters to retrieving the semantic meaning-that impose the greatest limits on reading ability. The results will enhance our understanding of the limitations of the human brain, setting the stage for further research applied to learning disabilities. Dyslexia impairs reading for up to 10 percent of the population, and it may have multiple causes including difficulties with word sounds (phonology). In some theories, reading is slowed by failures to select small chunks of text in the correct order, or by improper division of attention across the page. Therefore, by studying how visual attention works in typical readers, this project may elucidate the mechanisms of dyslexia and impairments caused by brain damage. That knowledge can help design interventions targeted to each individual according to the challenges he or she faces."
"9122752","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) claims more than 200,000 lives globally every year, and there are still no effective therapies in use for this fatal  disease. Besides universal loss of the RB and P53 tumor suppressors required for SCLC initiation, the key pathways driving SCLC progression have still not been identified. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular events that result in the aggressive itinerary of SCLC. Recent efforts to sequence the genomes of over 100 human SCLC tumors have identified rare oncogenic mutations and some regions undergoing amplification, but these analyses failed to shed light on a central oncogenic pathway that may drive the development of this cancer. Recently, the concept of non-oncogene addiction has emerged, which states that cancers may require certain active molecular pathways that are unmarked by mutations. Therefore, active but non-mutated signaling transductors such as kinases may play crucial roles in the development of cancers while remaining undiscovered by sequencing approaches. Using novel proteomic methodology, we recently obtained a first view of the active kinome of SCLC. Among active kinases in SCLC, Mek5 is particularly intriguing. Mek5 and its downstream target, Erk5, comprise a still poorly characterized signaling pathway; emerging evidence suggests that, similar to the more studied Mek1/2- Erk1/2 pathway, the Mek5/Erk5 axis may also regulate cell survival and cycling. Mek5 and Erk5 have never been studied in SCLC cells and little is still known about their role in cancer in general. Here we hypothesize that the Mek5/Erk5 module is crucial to the growth of SCLC. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary observations that Mek5- or Erk5-deficient SCLC cells show severe growth deficiencies and increased apoptotic cell death. However, we lack a complete understanding of the requirement for this axis in SCLC development in the organismal context, and of how Mek5/Erk5 may be performing these roles. To investigate the role of the Mek5/Erk5 kinase axis in SCLC, we will utilize patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and a genetically-engineered mouse model of SCLC. We first propose to determine if the Mek5/Erk5 axis is necessary for SCLC initiation and progression in mice in vivo. Second, we will investigate the role of Mek5/Erk5 in SCLC maintenance using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Third, we will perform structure-function studies and use advanced proteomics to investigate the mechanisms of action of Erk5 in SCLC cells. This study will characterize a novel non-mutated tumorigenic signaling pathway in the development of SCLC. We hope that a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying SCLC development will aid to identify novel therapeutic approaches for patient treatment."
"9237980","Oligodendrocytes are myelin-forming macroglia found in all regions of the central nervous system. The major function of myelin sheaths is to ensure the rapid and faithful transmission of electrical signals. During development, oligodendrocytes precursor cells (OPCs) have to go through a series of morphological and molecular changes before they become fully differentiated into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes. The differentiation and myelination processes of oligodendrocytes are regulated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Recently we found that Ick cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase is selectively up-regulated in differentiating OPCs and disruption of Ick resulted a significant inhibition of OL differentiation. In this application, we hypothesize that Ick enhances OPC differentiation and axonal myelination by Ick during development and enhance myelin repair following demyelination insults. The first aim of this application is to examine whether Ick expression is required for myelin development in Ick conditional mutant mice, and induced expression of Ick protein in OPCs promotes developmental myelination in inducible transgenic mice. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that Ick expression is also required for axonal remyelination in adult animals and overexpression of Ick in inducible transgenic mice can promote myelin recovery following demyelination  This line of study could help us understand molecular mechanisms that control axonal myelination process and provide insights into the development of molecular approaches to stimulate oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination in demyelinating diseases."
"9072402","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age related diseases causing dementia are an increasing global, social and economic catastrophe that mandates broad and aggressive research. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in older adults and affects over 5 million people in the US alone. Vascular contributions to dementia and AD are increasingly recognized. However, the role of the cerebrovascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD, and the underlying neurovascular mechanisms remain, to date, largely unknown and under researched, representing a critical barrier in the field. The overall goals of this program are to advance current knowledge on the vascular contributions to dementia and AD, and establish whether the neurovasculature plays a major role in cognitive decline, and therefore is a key new therapeutic target to treat dementia and AD. This is a program project application with multiple projects, cores, institutions and investigators. It represents an integrated whole far greater than the sum of its parts. Each project and core complements the others so that a synergistic relationship among them is achieved with a common focus on goals of the program, namely to test the neurovascular hypothesis of AD. This hypothesis holds that cerebrovascular dysfunction and disruption in the neurovascular integrity underlies and contributes to the onset and progression of cognitive decline. We have enlisted the established clinical and translational research groups that collectively bring significant expertise in all aspects of the research plan and each have contributed productively over many years to the study of dementia and AD. To test the 'neurovascular hypothesis', the participating investigators will apply cutting-edge molecular and imaging methods. We will perform parallel studies with analogous measures in humans and rats in two AD genetic risk groups with the major genetic risk factors for late-onset AD, i.e., apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4) gene and early-onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), i.e., presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations that both develop early vascular dysfunction and significant cerebrovascular pathology, and in the rat model of AD (line TgF344-AD) that faithfully recapitulates the rich clinico-pathological spectrum of human AD including the presence of early vascular dysfunction and cerebrovascular pathology. Central to our approach is our commitment to take a new research direction with the overarching goal to provide an answer to the broader question; 'what is the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of dementia and AD', and 'what is the prognostic and diagnostic value of neurovascular molecular and imaging biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline'. The relationship between neurovascular integrity, brain connectivity and cognitive function has not been explored. The collective expertise of the investigators, overall environment, preliminary results, and experimental design for each of the projects and supporting cores hold tremendous promise for the success of this program. We are confident that the proposed studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of pathogenesis, treatment, and early prevention of dementia and AD."

The program will: 1) recruit innovative entry-level scientists to the Prostate Cancer SPORE to enhance the  overall translational research capability of the SPORE and bring new techniques and talent to our program; 2)  help these individuals develop the intellectual and technical skills required to be productive investigators in  translational prostate cancer research; 3) teach these individuals basic principles of cancer biology not  commonly included in clinical training or doctoral degree programs; and 4) guide the entry-level scientists in  the development of competitive grant proposals in the area of translational prostate cancer research. The  unique educational environment at MD Anderson will ensure that these goals will be met. At least two Career  Enhancement awardees will be selected annually during the active funding period from qualified candidates  within and outside MD Anderson who respond to a SPORE solicitation based on the defined criteria. Special  emphasis will be placed on recruiting qualified women and members of minority populations whenever  possible. In response to the previous critique, Dr. Logothetis will be actively involved in recruiting qualified  physician/scientists to increase the number of MDs obtaining CEPs. Mentorship training will include principles  of cancer biology, scientific methods, statistical analysis, biomedical communications, and strategies  necessary to become successful in translational prostate cancer research. Several courses in The University of  Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston that encompass these disciplines are available to  CEP recipients. The CEP recipients will be evaluated annually, and the selection process and training will be  modified when appropriate. In addition, ?upward? evaluation by recipients to their mentors will also occur  annually, with modifications to the program made, as necessary, in response to input of CEP recipients (see  Appendix ?CEP Pilot Project Review Form? and ?CEP Evaluation Form? for evaluation criteria).  Nine Career Development awards (now Career Enhancement awards) have been funded by the Prostate  Cancer SPORE. Investigators receiving CDP awards wrote 53 publications. A total of 25 externally reviewed  grant applications were funded. Of note, Dr. Hui-Kuan Lin, a CDP awardee, will submit a Developmental  Research Program (DRP) project to the SPORE, reflecting the synergistic relationship between the CEP and  DRP mechanisms. Dr. Ana Aparicio, genitourinary medical oncologist, is a CEP awardee."
"9240850","Analyzing Large-Scale Neuroimaging Data in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract: Advances in imaging technology offer great opportunities to study Alzheimer's disease (AD) in many ways that are not previously possible. This leads to various large-scale imaging studies, i.e., ADNI, for discovering AD-related imaging biomarkers. In these imaging studies, image registration plays a key role in reducing the confounding inter-subject variability and also enhancing the statistical power of identifying abnormalities related to AD. However, automated processing of large-scale imaging data, i.e., involving anything from hundreds to thousands of 3D brain images, is not trivial and requires dedicated computational tools. The goal of this project is to develop a series of novel deep multi-layer groupwise registration methods for effective, efficient and simultaneous registration of all brain images with possibly large anatomical and appearance differences. Also, to accommodate for new images acquired from the on-going large-scale imaging study, an efficient incremental groupwise registration method will be further developed to avoid time- and resource-consuming re-registration of all new and existing images from scratch. Our key idea is to break down the complex groupwise registration problem into hierarchical sets of small- scale registration tasks that can be solved easily, thus making the large-scale registration more manageable and fast. Specifically, 1) for fast initialization of large-scale groupwise registration of brain images, we will develop in Aim 1 a hierarchical learning-based landmark detection algorithm, based on random forest regression, to detect salient anatomical landmarks and then jointly align all images with detected landmarks. Since all images are distributed in a complex manifold and also the registration of similar images is much faster and more accurate, we propose to first build a graph to link each image only with similar images, and then formulate groupwise registration as dynamic graph shrinkage. This avoids direct registration of each image to the group-mean image as done in the conventional methods, thus improving both speed and accuracy. 2) To significantly speed up and also improve this single-layer graph-based groupwise registration, we will further develop in Aim 2 a deep multi-layer groupwise registration by simultaneous layer-by-layer graph construction and layer-wise registration. 3) Finally, to significantly increase both the speed and accuracy of registration for new images acquired from on-going large-scale imaging study, we will develop in Aim 3 a novel incremental groupwise registration method to reuse previous registration results of existing images for guiding registration of new images. Specifically, each new image can be quickly registered to the common space of existing images by finding its most similar existing image(s). Accordingly, all new and existing images will become similar in the common space and then can be quickly updated for their overall groupwise registration. All computational tools developed will be made freely available to the research community, for accelerating the imaging study of Alzheimer's disease."
"9145285","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the result of a blood clot in a cerebral artery. It remains a leading killer and the leading cause of long-term disabilit, annually impacting over 700,000 Americans [10]. Because brain tissue rapidly dies, time to reperfusion is critical in both preventing death and improving neurological outcomes. While current annual costs related to ischemic stroke are high in the United States (US), they are projected to increase from $72B in 2013 to $183B by 2030 [14]. Intravenous (IV) administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the standard of care for AIS [15], despite a small ~10% chance for a full recovery and a >65% chance of death or severe disability [16]. While tPA has been proven to offer statistically-significant benefits, albeit low, in AIS [11] [12] [13], the dose- dependent bleeding associated with tPA has resulted in a low ~8% administration rate in the US. As a result, a large majority of stroke victims are greatly underserved despite efforts to improve standards of care. Due to poor fluid dynamics, the effectiveness of all thrombolytic drugs is because of their inability to rapidly diffuse to a clot in the occluded vessel [17]. Pulse Therapeutics, Inc.'s (PTI's) patented and clinically- investigated technology has overcome this limitation in a way that dramatically accelerates tPA delivery to a clot by using non-tPA-attached magnetite particles controlled by an external magnet. This technology is deployed in the emergency department after the baseline CT. However, by attaching the FDA-approved drug tPA to PTI's magnetite particles, the technology promises faster clot lysis (driving better neurological outcomes) at a substantially lower tPA dose (allowing expansion to nearly all ischemic strokes). PTI's objective is to demonstrate dramatic improvements in thrombolysis by attaching tPA to the company's magnetic particles. In Phase I, PTI will attempt to 1) develop optimal magnetite particles with the best- performing tPA coating conjugated to the surface, 2) collect data on the candidate particle's clot lysis rate and proper dosing in vitro, 3) optimize a software algorithm for automated particle collection, and 4) conduct a pre- submission meeting with the FDA. For Phase II, PTI will 5) modify an existing PTI magnet system suitable for use in pre-clinical animal studies, 6) identify the best tPA-coated particle from safety and efficacy GLP preclinical studies, and 7) assemble a data package in preparation for a subsequent FDA IDE submission. The proposed technology has dramatic implications for the treatment of AIS. By delivering tPA directly to the clot's surface via attachment to magnetic particles, clot lysis willto occur faster and result in better neurological outcomes, while drug-related toxicity effects may be eliminated, thereby expanding thrombolytic therapy from the ~30% maximum stroke victims eligible today, to potentially all ischemic stroke victims."
"9224517","Project summary/Abstract Candidate I am a board-certified neurologist committed to a career in health-oriented basic and translational research. I have research expertise in ion channel biology and immunology, clinical research methods and clinical neurology. My long-term goal is to establish myself as a successful independent physician-scientist in neuroinflammation and translational neuroscience. To achieve this goal and facilitate my transition to independence, I seek 5 years of mentored training through a NIH K08 career development award to fill gaps in my research training, establish a network of future research collaborators, build my publication record and grant-writing skills and pursue training in leadership and faculty development. Environment The training and mentoring environment at Emory is ideally suited for my career development. My mentorship committee at Emory University is comprised of experts and independent scientists in the fields of neurodegeneration (Dr. Allan Levey), neuroinflammation (Dr. Malu Tansey) and proteomics/systems biology (Dr. Nicholas Seyfried), each with exemplary records of NIH and non-federal funding, leading successful and productive research groups and training post-doctoral and physician-scientist trainees. My mentors and their research groups will provide me with hands-on training in (1) Animal models of neurodegeneration as tools to facilitate translational research, (2) Functional assays of microglia and macrophages, immune signaling, immunoassays, glial biology, and (3) Proteomics, bioinformatics and systems biology. I will receive research mentorship through weekly and monthly interactions and direct oversight of my research progress, presentations at journal clubs, seminars and presentations at local and national meetings. I will also receive formal coursework in glial biology, immunology, advanced methods in neuroscience research, bioinformatics, R programing, systems biology (WeiGhted Correlation Network Analysis) and in the responsible conduct of research (>12 credit hours and in-person training that fulfils NIH requirements) at Emory University. A team of intra- and extra-mural contributors with expertise in systems biology, peptide synthesis, potassium channel biology and biostatistics will also guide the proposed research. Emory University is a large academic institution with Neuroscience and Neurology receiving one of highest research funding from the NIH (9th in the US). The Emory Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (CND) is a collaborative and cross-disciplinary research environment with shared laboratory and research resources supported by NIH-funded research core facilities in neuropathology, proteomics, multiplexed immunoassays, flow cytometry, cell imaging and rodent neurobehavioral methods. Research Disease-modifying therapies are lacking for Alzheimer?s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Immune responses mediated by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly recognized to influence neurodegeneration through pro- inflammatory (disease-promoting) and anti-inflammatory (protective) mechanisms. Selective inhibitors of pro- inflammatory functions that spare and/or promote anti-inflammatory effects may lead to development of novel disease-modifying therapies for AD as well as other neurodegenerative diseases. Potassium channels expressed by MPs in the brain are key regulators of immune functions and our preliminary data suggest that pro-inflammatory MP functions are regulated by Kv1.3 potassium channels while anti-inflammatory MP functions are regulated by a different K channel called Kir2.1. In this proposal, we will first determine the functional importance of Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 channels in pro- and anti-inflammatory MP functions including reactive oxygen species production, cytokine/chemokine production in-vitro; and will investigate the down- stream signaling and transcriptional effects of Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 channel blockade in MPs (Aim 1). Next, we will determine expression patterns of these two potassium channels in peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages and microglia isolated from the mouse AD brain and will test whether these channels regulate the ability of peripherally derived MPs to enter the brain in a mouse model of AD pathology (Aim 2). Lastly, we will perform initial studies of chronic blockade of Kv1.3 and Kir2.1 channels using novel highly-selective and potent blockers as therapeutic strategies to mitigate neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD (Aim 3). The results of this work will provide novel insights into microglial and macrophage biology, immune regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and potentially identify novel therapeutic strategies that can modify disease progression in AD. The data generated from these research aims will also advance the candidate?s career development and will lead to future independent investigator (R01) grants and future collaborative research across the spectrum of neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory diseases."
"9168349","ABSTRACT A single stem or progenitor cell can give rise to a breathtaking diversity of differentiated cell types, but our understanding of how single cells choose their fate is limited. This is because cells make individual fate decisions regulated by both molecular and environmental factors, but it is challenging to tease these effects apart. To this end, recent advances in the ability to sequence the molecular contents of a given cell (i.e. single cell RNA-seq) represent a potentially transformative development. However, while these methods can be applied to hundreds or even thousands of cells, they return only a gene expression matrix ? the equivalent of a hypothetical study that sequenced thousands of human genomes but recorded no information about each patient. What is missing is the `metadata' of the cell: What is its regulatory and developmental state? Where was it located in situ? Who were its parents and siblings? To understand cellular decision making, we need to perform an integrated analysis of a cell's transcriptome, environment, and lineage, but unfortunately we lack the tools to directly measure these parameters simultaneously. To address this challenge, I hypothesize that the cellular `metadata' is encoded in gene expression, and therefore can be inferred from single cell RNA-seq datasets. Here, I propose to develop an integrated experimental and computational framework to simultaneously learn the transcriptome and `metadata' from thousands of single cells. I will design strategies to analyze single cell gene expression and learn a cell's regulatory state, pinpoint its environmental milieu, and reconstruct its lineage relationships. I will apply these methods to systematically decipher the regulation of cell fate during the development of the mammalian immune and nervous systems. If successful, however, this work will present a general and widely applicable strategy to study how the interaction between molecular and environmental factors governs cell behavior."
"9272200","Project Summary /Abstract Small vessel cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease are the two most common causes of cognitive decline in the elderly, but methods for determining the relative contributions of both these pathologies to functional impairment, understanding their interactions, predicting progression and defining targets for clinical trials remain underdeveloped. The overarching goal of this proposal is to further develop novel neuroimaging and serologic biomarkers of cerebrovascular disease. Accomplishing this goal will improve early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of small vessel cerebrovascular disease in older subjects, and provide better targets and outcome metrics for clinical trials. We propose to longitudinally study 400 well characterized older subjects from ongoing projects at UCSF and UCD who present with a range of cerebrovascular burden and functional decline. Our search for biomarkers will focus on novel neuroimaging variables and measures of endothelial dysfunction. Our aims will address the relationships between these markers and measures of amyloid burden, cognition, and change over time."
"9014456","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by Applicant): Extensive evidence has indicated that air pollution contributes to the risk and severity of atherosclerotic disease. However, the mechanism by which PM2.5 exaggerates atherosclerosis remains hard to explain given that there is very little evidence for systemic translocation of particles from the lungs. The overall objective (immediate career goal) of this K99/R00 grant application is to identify a mechanism by which air pollution induces systemic and vascular lipid abnormalities and inflammation. Our pilot study suggests the involvement of oxidized lipids and pattern recognition receptor CD36 in transmitting the adverse vascular effect of PM2.5. This grant application will further our investigation of how PM2.5 initiates systemic and vascular inflammation using multidisciplinary methods that will significantly propel the principle investigator's career towards ultimate goal (to be an independent scientist working in an interdisciplinary research area of environmental science, cardiovascular biology, and lipidology): In K99 phase (Aim 1), the oxidized lipid profile in response to air pollution and cell types responsible for air pollution-induced lipid oxidation willbe examined in vivo using an exposure system that concentrates ambient air pollution allowing for chronic exposure experiments at environmentally relevant concentrations, followed by lipodomic analysis under the supervision of an internationally recognized leader in oxidative lipidomics, while incorporating unique animal models. By utilizing techniques acquired in the K99 phase, R00 phase (Aim 2) will test the hypothesis that increased lipid oxidation in plasma lipoproteins up-regulates monocyte CD36 subsequently promoting oxidized lipid accumulation and inflammasome activation in atherosclerotic plaques. The successful completion of the project will provide innovative insights into the molecular mechanism underlying how air pollutants mediated adverse systemic and/or vascular effects. It will also identify novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis and air pollution prevention. To achieve the proposed goals, the investigator has assembled a strong mentoring team consisting of Dr. Sanjay Rajagopalan (mentor), an internationally recognized expert in environmental cardiology, Dr. Valerian E. Kagan (co-mentor), an internationally recognized leader in oxidative lipidology, and Dr. Shyam S. Biswal, an internationally recognized expert in environmental toxicant-induced oxidative stress. The investigator will obtain training in lipidomic approaches (CyTOF-MS, ESI-MS, MALDI-MS, and flow cytometric detection of cellular/mitochondrial ROS), advanced knowledge in oxidative lipidology and Nrf2 biology, and lab management during the award period. Overall, the excellent environment at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, and University of Pittsburgh will facilitate the successful completion of the proposed research and assure a successful transition of the investigator to independence."
"9082863","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Agitation is common in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major burden to patients and caregivers. Finding effective treatments is a priority. The standard of care recommends initial use of non-pharmacologic followed by pharmacologic interventions. This approach has several challenges in the real world including unknown efficacy, sparse use of non-pharmacologic therapies, and widespread, often inappropriate, use of antipsychotics that carry significant risks. There is need for effective therapies for agitation combining non-pharmacologic with novel pharmacologic approaches, reducing antipsychotic use, and targeting therapies to appropriate subgroups of this heterogeneous condition. A hypothesized cause of agitation in AD is neurodegeneration that disrupts, then destroys, brain ascending serotonergic pathways. Attempting to develop a novel therapy targeting the serotonin system, we conducted Citalopram in AD (CitAD), a double blind, controlled trial that administered a real world-usable psychosocial intervention to all and additionally randomized participants to the SSRI citalopram at 30mg/day or placebo. In CitAD, racemic citalopram was effective for agitation with 40% of citalopram-treated participants experiencing substantial clinical improvement vs. only 26% on placebo. However, citalopram was associated with cognitive worsening and prolongation of the ECG-QTc interval. In blood concentration models, cognitive and cardiac changes were associated with the R-enantiomer, while clinical improvements were primarily associated with the S-enantiomer (escitalopram). We propose S-CitAD to build on and extend these findings. We will develop an evidence-based, sequential approach to treating agitation in AD with real world applicability for patients. We will enroll 589 patients with AD and agitation and administer the psychosocial intervention used in CitAD. Patients not showing clinically significant improvement in agitation after 3 weeks will be randomized to drug or placebo. Given the findings of CitAD, since the dose of citalopram used in CitAD may be contraindicated in older patients, we will use S-citalopram (originally marketed as Lexapro(r), now generic) instead of the racemic citalopram used in CitAD. In psychosocial intervention non-responders, we will evaluate for efficacy and safety over 12-weeks (AIM 1). We will also evaluate pre-specified predictors of response suggested by CitAD (AIM 2). Finally, we will follow patients showing significant improvement on the psychosocial intervention to study predictors of response, as well as duration of improvement and frequency, time course, and predictors of subsequent relapse (AIM 3). IMPACT: S-CitAD will provide clinicians and payers practical information about a real world-usable, immediately available approach to treating agitation in AD. S-CitAD findings will also form the basis for later treatment development providing information on non-responders in different phases of this sequential approach, and becoming a model of how to evaluate predictors of response in NPS treatment studies."
"9072859","ABSTRACT  The remarkable yield of novel genetic associations over the last decade resulting from the agnostic approach  of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) had not been matched by comparable advances on the  environmental side. The exposome concept introduced by Chris Wild in 2005 as a comprehensive  description of lifelong exposure history of external exposures (e.g., chemical, physical, and biological agents),  general external environment (e.g., climate, urban-rural, socioeconomic position), and internal exposures (e.g.,  metabolites, gut microflora) has been operationalized in terms of the measurement of internal chemicals at  particular points in time, typically using mass spectrometry to characterize the metabolome. With this  machinery Environment-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) are now feasible, but there remain numerous  methodological challenges before the EWAS concept can be considered a real companion to GWASs,  including the dynamic nature of the external and internal environment, the problem of reverse causation,  control of non-genetic host and environmental confounders, measurement error (temporal variability,  instrument error, identification of unknown chemicals, etc.), and ways of conducting Gene-Environment-Wide  Interaction Studies (GEWIS). An important component of the exposome is the microbiome. Evidence is  mounting linking tumor promotion in a broad array of cancer types to the effects of bacterial microbiota. Local  environmental conditions, affected by diet, antibiotics, pre- and probiotics, etc., could affect the structure of  microbial communities, affecting risk of disease and response to therapy. The advent of high-throughput  sequencing has allowed the relatively inexpensive identification and quantification of thousands of operational  taxonomic units (OTUs) in a single biospecimen, providing a wealth of information on the complex structure of  resident microbial communities. The microbiome raises many of the same methodological challenges as the  exposome, such as time dependency, reverse causation, and non-genetic confounding, but also some different  ones like ways of characterizing community effects like diversity and resilience. Although GxE and GxG are  also relevant, equally interesting are host-microbial interactions and exposome-microbiome interactions. We  propose an integrated approach to developing statistical methods for studying the determinants of the internal  environment (the metabolome and the microbiome jointly) in relation to the external environment and the host  genome and the relationship of the internal environment to disease risk. As part of this we propose to develop  Bayesian network methods to relate all these variables and investigate mediation. We will apply our methods  to data from, e.g., the Multi-Ethnic Cohort, the ColoCare Consortium, and a study of colorectal polyps in twins."
"9137503","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High deductible health plans (HDHPs) have lower premiums, but require patients to pay the full cost of most medical care until annual deductibles of $1000 to $6000 are met. HDHPs have proliferated rapidly over the last decade. Health Savings Account (HSA)-qualified HDHPs are the most rapidly growing HDHP arrangement, now covering 14% of commercially insured Americans. These plans subject most health care services (including medications) to high annual deductibles but allow pre-tax contributions to accounts that can be used for medical costs. Advocates believe that exposing patients to greater costs will create activated consumers who will seek higher-value health care and adopt healthy behaviors, while critics fear that these economic barriers may reduce access to needed care. Our ongoing project in the Natural Experiments in Diabetes Translation (NEXT-D) initiative (5U58DP002719) has determined that diabetes patients with HSA-HDHPs experience the largest reductions in hospital access and adherence to key medications for chronic illness. Although these findings are concerning, federal regulations allow employers to tailor HSA-HDHPs through two mechanisms that could improve access to care: (1) Exempting certain chronic medications from deductible requirements (i.e., medications cost $0 to patients) through preventive drug lists ($0-PDs), and (2) Generously funding HSAs so that employees pay less out-of-pocket. Thus, HSA-HDHPs represent both a risk to diabetes patients but also an opportunity for employers to improve care through tailored cost sharing reductions. In this application, we will examine effects of these two important variations in HDHP design on diabetes secondary prevention, high priority care, diabetes complications, and costs, both overall and among vulnerable subgroups (men, low socioeconomic status, Black or Hispanic, severe diabetes, high comorbidity). We will employ a cutting-edge interrupted time series study design that approximates the estimates of randomized controlled trials. We will draw from a 12-year rolling cohort (2005-2017) of >60 million members insured by a large national health plan, with 30,000 diabetes patients who experience employer-mandated transitions to HSA-HDHPs. We will also conduct economic analyses from the employer and member perspectives of the impacts of $0-PDs and generously funded HSAs on total health care and out-of-pocket costs. Our findings will allow policy makers and employers to develop tailored, next-generation health insurance designs that optimize quality and equity for diabetes patients who are most vulnerable under HDHPs."
"9265185","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What enables a baby's brain to learn so rapidly during early developmental critical periods? What cell and molecular mechanisms cause the decline in extensive plasticity by adulthood? The goal here is to enhance synaptic plasticity by discovering and then blocking endogenous mechanisms that function to suppress plasticity and circuit change. Specifically, can manipulations of the neuronal receptor PirB (Paired Immunoglobulin-like receptor B; Lilrb3 in humans) release the brake on ocular dominance (OD) plasticity, a form of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in visual cortex? In the immune system PirB is a receptor for Major Histocompatibility Class I molecules, famous ligands for T-cell receptors. This Lab made the unexpected discovery that neurons express PirB and MHCI molecules at synapses. OD plasticity is enhanced in visual cortex of mice with germline deletion of PirB, consistent with PirB acting to brake synaptic plasticity. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine if acute deletion of PirB postnatally enhances OD plasticity: A conditional allele of PirB (PirB flox/flox) has been made, allowing acute temporal and cell-type disruption of PirB by crossing mice with tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgenic lines. Direct blockade of PirB with recombinant soluble truncated PirB protein or function-blocking antibodies will also be used. These experiments should reveal when and in what cell types PirB acts. 2) Link enhanced OD plasticity in PirB-/- mice to cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) will be studied in vitro in visual cortex slices using physiological methods. Dendritic spine density of YFP-labeled layer 5 pyramidal neurons will be measured in PirB-/- vs WT mice reared with normal visual experience or with monocular eye closure; spine stability will be examined using two-photon microscopy. These experiments should broaden understanding of how PirB acts at synaptic and structural levels to suppress plasticity. 3) Identify PirB signal transduction pathways in mouse visual cortex: Candidate signaling pathways downstream of PirB will be identified and evaluated by comparing visually-driven signaling in WT vs germline PirB-/- mouse visual cortex during and after the critical period. Changes in expression and phosphorylation levels will be assessed in candidate pathways including MAP Kinase, AKT and mTOR signaling. Studies here will employ genetic, biochemical, electrophysiological, imaging and anatomical methods in mice to assess OD plasticity at the systems level and to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of PirB function. Together, experiments should elucidate how PirB normally acts in neurons to suppress synaptic-plasticity signaling pathways during and beyond the critical period, as well as test feasibility of restoring OD plasticity by acute PirB blockade. They represent key steps in understanding mechanisms of developmental critical periods, as well as for designing new ways to enhance CNS function and repair by engaging the brain's inherent capacity for neural plasticity."
"9249720","PROJECT SUMMARY The UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals for 2020 represents an ambitious strategy to end the AIDS epidemic. The third target envisions 90% of all patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to be virally suppressed. In 2013, WHO recommended the transition to viral load (VL) monitoring for all patients on ART for more than 6 months and at least at 12-month intervals thereafter. While VL testing is the gold standard of HIV treatment monitoring, it is not routinely available and employed in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). WHO estimates that only 20% of patients on ART were receiving VL testing in most LMICs. Nigeria, with a population of 180 million, has the second highest burden of HIV in the world. As of 2014, 747.382 Nigerians were on ART, with just under 50% coverage of those considered eligible for treatment. With only 25 VL instruments in the country, it is clear that additional VL capacity is required and we believe that at least some of this need could be rationally filled with the use of point of care (POC) VL technology. . This proposal seeks to optimize VL monitoring in response to objective 6 of this RFA. We propose a randomized control trial of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi-quantitative (SQ) monitoring versus standard of care (SOC) VL monitoring in patients newly initiating ART. We have recently demonstrated excellent performance of the Simple Amplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) semi- quantitative (SQ) HIV-1 VL test, which has the added benefit of providing results in 90 minutes from a finger prick blood sample, in Nigeria. We hypothesize that use of a POC VL will result in increased viral suppression rates as well as improved adherence and retention rates for patients on ART. A tertiary teaching hospital in North-Central Nigeria, Jos University Teaching Hospital, and a secondary district hospital, Comprehensive Health Centre, Zamko, that currently accesses VL monitoring through a networked approach are our proposed trial sites. The specific aims of the proposed project are to:  1. Compare the 12-month outcomes of patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL  2. Compare the retention and adherence rates in patients monitored with POC VL versus SOC VL, with a  sub-aim of comparing drug resistant mutation patterns in patients that fail 1L ART by month 12 of treatment.  3. Determine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing POC VL monitoring The proposed trial will provide the first evaluation of a POC VL monitoring program in a relevant ART setting, the results will help inform priorities for the implementation of POC VL in Nigeria and other LMICs."
"9124249","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a postdoctoral training proposal for a basic scientist (Ph.D., lung toxicology) seeking expertise in state-of-the-art proteomics and metabolomics within a clinical pulmonary division, with the long-term goal of a research career in the mechanisms of lung disease. The proposal is significant to human health because it will systematically elucidate biological targets of hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), major reactive chemicals formed during lung inflammation. HOSCN and HOCl are strong oxidants, taking electrons from antioxidants such as protein cysteine (Cys) residues thousands of times faster than hydrogen peroxide. However, HOSCN and HOCl differ in reactivity with specific Cys residues and cytotoxicity to multiple cell types. Furthermore, thiocyanate, which converts HOCl to HOSCN in vivo, improves outcomes of lung infection and inflammation in mice. Recent work demonstrated that thioredoxin reductase safely removes HOSCN but not HOCl in lung epithelia, causing cells exposed to HOSCN to be more viable than those given an equal dose of HOCl. This demonstrated that differential reactivity of HOSCN and HOCl with lung cell proteins could underpin the differences of their effects. Although several direct reactions have been studied, the critical targets of these oxidants in complex biological systems are uncertain, especially for HOSCN. This two-year proposal will take advantage of Emory University mentored training, environment and resources to produce impactful science. Two aims will investigate differential targeting of proteins and small molecules by HOSCN and HOCl in the lung using cell and animal models. Experiments will take advantage of well-developed mass spectrometry (MS)-based redox proteomic methods developed in the primary mentoring lab. This will be complemented with liquid chromatography-high resolution MS-based metabolomics, which gives unsurpassed measurement of metabolites in plasma, lung tissue and airway lining fluid. Scientific expertise and animal and cell resources in the Emory Center for CF and Airways Disease Research will be key components of the proposal aims. The proposal also takes advantage of training in integrated -omics techniques, national meetings and didactic training. This combination of academic environment, training and resources will build a sound foundation for the research career development of the applicant. The research resulting from this proposal will set a path for future translation of results into human studies. For example, human lavage fluid, sputum, tissue and plasma are collected at the Emory CF Bio-Repository and could be analyzed. Banked samples from the proposed studies will also provide for additional experiments not possible in the proposed time frame. This training and research plan will enable the applicant's continued development toward a successful independent research career in pulmonary biology and disease."

The current project is part of a new effort to focus on engaging young women before they become pregnant - a concept called preconception care. Simply, healthy women are more likely to have healthy babies. Intervention. This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an innovative health communication system (Gabby) that provides preconception health care across 12 domains of health and utilizes advanced capabilities to remain current through story-telling functionality, and scales the intervention to a large number of women via its social marketing applications. Methods: A two-armed randomized controlled trial of African American women ages 18-25 recruited through community-based organizations. Both groups will undergo a comprehensive preconception health risk assessment. The intervention group will then receive the Gabby intervention. The control group will be sent a list of health risks generated by the health risk assessment. Outcomes: At twelve months, we will measure improvement in health risks. Secondary outcomes include measurement of usage rates, dose of exposure, attrition, patient and health worker and subject satisfaction, number of women with a personalized health plan, and timeliness of response. Sub analyses include the impact of perceived societal stress and health literacy on outcomes. Significance: The potential to create a low-cost, user-friendly, culturally competent, evidence-based, scalable intervention that is continuously refreshed (via the story telling function) and can be used across a range of health care, educational and community settings to improve the health of young African American women."

Additionally, senile skeletal muscle displays increased stiffness which can have numerous effects on health, physical function and independence. There is, therefore, a critical need for accurate, non-invasive techniques to quantify passive skeletal muscle stiffness. The long term goal of this project is to develop effective diagnostic strategies and interventions that will improve the physical functioning and independence of older adults. The objectives of this application, progressing towards the long-term goal, are to develop and validate a non-invasive method to quantify muscle stiffness, and to non-invasively assess the stiffness of skeletal muscle in both young and older adults. The central hypothesis is that novel, non-invasive ultrasound technology will be a reliable, valid technique to evaluate the passive stiffness of skeletal muscle throughout its functional range of motion. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the changes in skeletal muscle passive stiffness associated with aging may provide a basis for development of effective diagnostic and treatment procedures. Two specific aims will be pursued to objectively test the hypothesis. First, a non-invasive method will be developed and validated for assessing passive skeletal muscle stiffness throughout the physiologic range of tension. Second, the muscle stiffness changes with sarcopenia in humans will be quantified. The expected outcomes of the work proposed include developing the non-invasive methodology to understand the impact of aging and sarcopenia on passive properties of skeletal muscle. This contribution will be significant because it is the firs step towards developing effective diagnostic strategies and treatment interventions that will improve the diagnosis, assessment and prevention of sarcopenia progression and limited musculoskeletal function."
"9244893","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aggression is a highly complex, adaptive set of behaviors that has evolved to allow individuals to compete for limited resources (e.g., food, mates). Excessive or inappropriate aggressive behavior and violence, however, have become problematic in modern societies. Inappropriate aggression is associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, untreated mental illness is a significant contributor to violence against self or others, and current treatments are largely ineffective. To find better treatments for serious mental illness and its relation to violence we must develop a comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological, physiological and neuroendocrine contributors to aggressive behavior. This knowledge is relevant to the NIH?s mission in that it will potentially provide novel targets for intervention for psychiatric disease. This grant proposes to use an integrative approach, drawing upon environmental biology, neuroendocrinology, pharmacology and molecular neuroscience to understand how the steroid hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) contributes to increased aggressive behavior in males and females. Our preliminary data support our hypothesis of a ?seasonal switch? from gonadal to adrenal regulation of aggression, a novel alternative endocrine mechanism regulating aggressive behaviors. Siberian hamsters are an ideal model to address novel non-gonadal mechanisms of aggression because they display high levels of aggression that occur independent of reproduction, allowing the relationship between gonadal steroids and aggression to be uncoupled. Likewise, in humans, there is equivocal empirical evidence for a strong direct relationship between high testosterone and aggression. Thus, the similarities between hamster and human adrenals make hamsters an ideal model system to experimentally test the link between DHEA and human aggression. By employing pharmacological and molecular genetic approaches we will test the hypothesis that melatonin acts directly on the adrenals to regulate DHEA synthesis and ultimately aggressive behavior (Specific Aim 1). We also test the hypothesis that DHEA is the key regulator of short-day and melatonin-induced aggression by applying pharmacological methods to block DHEA synthesis and its conversion to active metabolites (testosterone and 17-? estradiol) (Specific Aim 2). Uncovering the precise role of adrenal steroids (e.g., DHEA) in the regulation of aggressive behavior is vital to the development of a comprehensive approach to the treatment of inappropriate human aggression. More broadly, such studies will provide a foundation for understanding how variations in steroid hormones may interact with mental illness and contribute to aggressive behavior."
"9253924","Abstract  The 2014 publication of the World Health Organization's urban air quality database indicates that 13 of the world's 25 most polluted cities are located within India. President Obama and Prime Minister Modi recognized the socioeconomic implications of this question and agreed to launch bilateral air quality cooperation to help urban dwellers reduce their exposure to harmful levels of ambient air pollution and enable urban policy planners to implement corrective strategies. This application requests funds to support a workshop to initiate and facilitate discussions for establishing strategies for U.S.-India collaborations to improve air quality in India. The research advances and their contribution to new regulations and policies, however, is moving forward rapidly in some countries but less so in others. Numerous studies have evaluated the global risk of exposure to ambient particles and gases. A major finding of these efforts is the recognition that pollutant sources and thus the composition of ambient particles, for example, can vary tremendously from region to region or season to season. However, despite the recognition that India's urban centers have some of the poorest air quality in the world, the specific sources that contribute to the pollution of India's ambient air have not been well addressed. In order to efficiently and effectively focus remediation efforts, we propose to bring together researchers from the U.S. and India to establish pathways for the identification of India-specific pollution sources and the research and policy changes that will be necessary to `clean' the air."
"9013656","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastasis is responsible for as much as 90% of cancer-associated mortality; yet progress has remained slow in developing effective drugs either specifically targeting metastasis or targeting cells with metastatic potential. Although thee are numerous studies showing the migratory potential of metastatic cells and relating metastasis to the biology of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), little is known about how tumor cells engage this fundamental cellular program. Recently, we have described a new non-canonical Wnt pathway involving signals through Wnt5-Frizzled2 (Fzd2) that drives EMT, cellular migration, invasion in vitro and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells as xenografts in mouse. Using focused proteomic approaches, we delineated the Fzd2 signaling pathway in a panel of metastatic cancer cell lines, identifying several novel signaling proteins downstream of Fzd2, including Fyn, Stat3, Axl and Pyk2. Thus far, these efforts have yielded information about individual proteins in Fzd2 signaling required for Fzd2-mediated cell migration; they have been less successful at providing mechanistic understanding of how this pathway drives the metastatic phenotype. Expression of Fzd2 in epithelial cells such as Huh7 and Dld1 causes increased motility and morphological changes triggering an EMT program. Preliminary data has shown that both Axl and Pyk2 are downstream of Fzd2 and affect Fzd2-mediated cell migration. Further, Axl and Pyk2 have been previously shown to affect both tumor growth and metastasis. With our data showing neutralizing anti-Fzd2 antibodies can strongly block metastasis in mouse xenograft, we were able to suggest that Fzd2-mediated EMT and metastasis may in part be regulated by Axl and Pyk2 kinases. I propose to address this by multiplex biochemical measurement, cellular phenotypic response assays and in vivo metastasis measurement to: (1) provide more complete information on how proteins in the Fzd2 network are connected and; (2) determine how the flow of information in the pathway drives enhanced cell migration and EMT. Overall, our analysis of the Fzd2 signaling network should highlight critical nodes and pathways that are linked to metastatic phenotypes especially increased motility and EMT. Equally important, my overall approach has the potential to guide future efforts to develop targeted therapies for metastatic cancer. My long-term goal is to develop a mechanistic and predictive understanding of signal transduction pathways driving the conversion of local tumors into metastatic ones by generating network-level and mechanistic models of the changes in signal transduction processes that accompany the EMT as part of metastatic transformation."

Socioeconomic adversity in early life is a risk factor for poor brain health?impaired cognitive function and cerebrovascular disease?in later life, but some individuals are resilient, achieving better-than-expected outcomes despite facing early life adversity. The mechanisms of resilience, as well as the causal pathways between early life adversity and later life brain health, are unclear, but educational experiences are very likely critical. This project will focus on mortality, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health conditions that increase risk for cerebrovascular disease, all outcomes that have been linked to early life socioeconomic adversity, and will evaluate the role of educational experiences in potentially promoting resilience to early life adversity. A central research question in our evaluation of school quality and long term impacts on brain health is whether there are racial/ethnic differences in the benefits of attending higher quality schools or the mechanisms though which education influences later health. The study will include ~9000 participants, currently aged 69-74, to assess cognitive abilities, health, and other aspects of resilience. Other innovations of this study include: a contemporary battery of cognitive abilities measures harmonized with several of the original 1960 measures, allowing direct measurement of change across 1960 to 2017 on multiple cognitive abilities; use of adaptive testing to reduce participant burden; and assessment via mailed tablet computers to facilitate measurement of memory and visuospatial abilities. This study has many advantages, including its sample size, prospective design, high quality measurement of multiple cognitive abilities in adolescence and older adulthood, assessment of educational quality and experiences, cognitive complexity of occupational and leisure activities, all in the context of its unique design that provides an unprecedented opportunity to address causal hypotheses."
"9119507","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young African American women carry a disproportionate burden of both unintended pregnancy and STDs. Dual protection strategies offer concurrent prevention of both unintended pregnancy and STDs. Previous efforts to develop clinic-based interventions to promote dual protection have met with limited success. Efforts have been hampered by a poor understanding of the strategies young women employ to protect themselves, the interplay among individual, partner and provider influences on young women's dual protection practices, and provider practices around dual protection. The proposed intervention seeks to build motivation for dual protection use, a multi-layered (self, peers, care team, partners, etc.) culture of support around dual protection use, a social norms shift towards expectation of dual protection use, and an acknowledgement of the influences and challenges of dual protection use as well as management suggestions for these challenges. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial testing group-based educational and clinical care to encourage dual protection use among young African American women. We will recruit African American females aged 15- 19 who are attending the Grady Memorial Teen Services Clinic for reproductive health care. Young women who consent to enrollment will be randomized to one of two groups. Clinic day will be the unit of randomization. Those randomized to the control arm will receive individual-based clinical care consistent with standard care protocols at the Grady Memorial Teen Services Clinic. Those randomized to the intervention arm will receive the same clinical care, however, participants will access clinic as a group. These participants will receive individual clinical care as needed as well as  group-based education with a focus on dual protection with the following approaches: Use of an interactive multimedia platform focused on dual protection strategies and selection of a strategy of Five group based educational sessions focusing on issues relevant to dual protection use (Importance of dual protection, Relationships, Sexual decision-making, Partner communication) A consistent care team (Nursing, Health Educator, Healthcare Provider) providing support and care to individuals attending the group sessions as needed Intercession communication via Facebook This intervention will span 18 months from recruitment to final follow-up. We will test the following hypotheses: H1: Participants in this multi-component intervention will experience lower incidence of biologic outcomes (unintended pregnancy, Chlamydia and/or gonorrhea) than participants in the control group. H2: Participants in this multi-component intervention will report higher adoption and adherence to proven dual protection strategies than participants in the control group."
"9282005","Project Summary Research consistently underscores the concerning rates and deleterious consequences of sexual violence (SV) and related forms of violence among youth. Yet, there are few prevention initiatives that lead to reductions in SV. At the same time, there is increasing recognition that youth violence prevention efforts may be most effective if youth are central to the development and implementation of such efforts. Problematically, there are no rigorously evaluated youth-led SV prevention efforts. The proposed project has the potential for high public health impact by establishing a project team inclusive of researchers, practitioners, educators, and peer opinion leaders who seek to implement and conduct a quasi-experimental and process evaluation of one of the largest youth-led violence prevention initiatives: Peer Solutions' STAND & SERVE (S&S). Although in need of rigorous evaluation, because S&S has been in Phoenix for two decades and is well-integrated throughout the city, it would be difficult to measure the impact of this initiative in Phoenix at this point in time. Furthermore, it is important from a scalability, replicability, and dissemination perspective to document the process by which such efforts are created, initially implemented, and sustained. The South Dakota (SD) Department of Health, a Rape Prevention Education-funded agency, has expressed a strong interest in enhancing their efforts by adding a peer-led SV prevention initiative. Thus, researchers at the University of New Hampshire, in partnership with the SD Network Against Family Violence and Sexual Assault, SD Department of Public Health, Peer Solutions, and Rapid City Area Schools seek to implement and evaluate S&S in middle and high schools within Rapid City, SD. Following refinement of the S&S through focus groups, key informant and stakeholder interviews, and input from a Research and Programming Advisory Board (RPAB), we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of S&S with middle and high school youth to determine the effectiveness of S&S in reducing rates of SV perpetration and increasing bystander actions and reducing other problematic behaviors (e.g., bullying, suicidality). Mediators (e.g., increases in positive youth development) and moderators (e.g., school climate) of outcomes will be examined. In addition to collecting survey data from middle and high school youth, we will collect survey data from school staff and parents/guardians and capture social media data to track diffusion of prevention messages. Finally process evaluation data will include observations and fidelity assessments of S&S programming, daily diary data and interview data from program facilitators and other key informants and stakeholders, and a cost-analysis of implementing S&S to inform replication, dissemination, scalability, and sustainability efforts. If S&S is deemed effective, the products (e.g., manuals, toolkits) that results from this project can be readily disseminated to communities across the U.S. who wish to implement and sustain a theoretically-grounded, multi-level, youth-led SV prevention initiative."
"9013245","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Future Research Questions: As an independent investigator, I will focus on answering two important questions: 1) What are the cells-of-origin or epigenetic programs that produce the two major types of lung tumors? and 2) How can epigenetic therapies be incorporated into useful cancer therapeutics? Background Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths world-wide. Precision medicine options for lung cancer patients may help to decrease the mortality of the disease by targeting the most vulnerable pathways in each specific cancer. However, these efforts are complicated by both the genetic and epigenetic complexity of lung tumors. How epigenetic programs influence critical aspects of lung tumorigenesis and normal lung biology remains an uncharted area. Furthermore, the lineage relationship and epigenetic differences between the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, namely lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, are unclear. My main goal is to find methods to incorporate epigenetic drugs into effective cancer therapies. I will initially focus on lung stem cell biology as my platform to elucidate the cellular origins and epigenetic therapeutic vulnerabilities in lung cancer. Methodology The research proposed herein will allow for direct comparison of the transformation capacity of several lung stem/progenitor cell pools through FACS isolation, lentiviral genetic modulation and 3D organotypic culture. The transformation potential and subtype acquisition of the cell pools will be tested by injection into the lungs of immunocompromised mice. This novel system will allow for careful dissection of what lung cells can serve as tumor cells-of-origin and in what contexts (i.e. genetic mutations and epigenetic modulation). These results can be linked back to the most permissible epigenetic states for transformation, and allow understanding of how epigenetic programs are co-opted by tumor cells during malignant transformation. In parallel, I will study the effects of different epigeneti therapeutics, namely inhibition of BRD4, EZH2 or G9A, on genetically defined murine lung tumors. I will again use the 3D organotypic culture assay, which I have optimized for primary tumor cell growth. This approach will allow cost-effective but biologically relevant assessment of the effects of epigenetic therapies on varied subtypes and genotypes of lung cancer. Both of these approaches will be translated to human biology by using human cells in the 3D cultures. Career Potential I have had a very successful post-doctoral career in the laboratory of Carla Kim at Boston Children's Hospital, and I have established a strong relationship with my collaborators for this award, Drs. Leonard Zon and Kwok- Kin Wong. I have an outstanding environment and a comprehensive plan that will allow me to transition to an independent research role. My ultimate goal is to lead a research group exploring the relationships between stem cells and cancer, with a specific focus on novel cancer therapeutics. I know that the K22 award would greatly aid me in realizing these goals."
"9213151","NICU PERFORMANCE: MISSED NURSING CARE AND INFANT OUTCOMES     More than half of all infant deaths annually in the U.S. are accounted for by infants with very low birth weight (VLBW)(< 1500 grams or 3.3 lbs.), indicating the high mortality burden carried by the over 60,000 infants born with VLBW. One in four VLBW infants dies; nine out of ten of these deaths occur in the first month of life while hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). There are large unexplained variations in VLBW infant mortality across NICUs that cannot be accounted for by infant risk factors, providing a compelling need to examine factors in the health care system that account for these variations. Since optimal management of VLBW infants depends on skilled nursing care, with the average NICU nurse caring for 2 or 3 infants at a time, we seek to ascertain if missed nursing care accounts for variation in infant mortality, nosocomial infection, length of stay, and parental satisfaction in order to identify points of intervention to improve outcomes. Missed nursing care, defined as required nursing care that is omitted or delayed in response to multiple demands or inadequate resources, occurs in this setting with potentially important consequences on patient outcomes. Therefore there is a critical need to quantify the impact on infants and parents and to identify the factors responsible for missed nursing care. The results of this study will allow for the development of novel, evidence-based, and clinically effective strategies to improve the health and life course of VLBW infants. To determine the effects of missed care on infant outcomes and parent satisfaction and to determine factors associated with missed NICU nursing care, we will first merge four large datasets: 1) the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators Registered Nurse Survey (NDNQI RN Survey) which includes information on missed care nursing, the nurse work environment and acuity-adjusted NICU nurse workload, 2) the Healthcare Cost and Utility Project State Inpatient Data that provides data on patient outcomes, 3) the American Hospital Association data on hospital structural measures, and 4) the Medicare Cost Report, which provides data on financial margins. Then, we will study parental satisfaction through a survey 240 parents of VLBW infants in 24 NDNQI units linked to the NDNQI RN survey data. With data from 89 NICUs across the nation (representing 5,785 VLBW infants) we will be able to (Aim 1): Determine associations between missed nursing care and NICU patient outcomes for VLBW infants. With the primary parent survey data we will be able to (Aim 2): Determine the association between missed nursing care and parent satisfaction with care in the NICU; and with data from 8,950 RNs employed in 179 NICUs be able to (Aim 3): Identify nurse and NICU organizational factors associated with missed nursing care. This research will result in healthier lives and better parental experiences for high-risk infants treated in the NICU by improving nursing care. "
"9146679","PROJECT 3: Targeting the D4Z4 sequence to enhance repeat repression Abstract FSHD is caused by mutations that decrease the efficiency of D4Z4 repeat-mediated epigenetic repression and result in the low-level variegated mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. The broad and long-term goal of this project is to identify components and modulators of the pathways that epigenetically silence D4Z4 repeats that can be exploited to develop a therapy for FSHD, and potentially other human diseases. The major hypothesis of this project is that enhancing the efficiency of repeat-mediated epigenetic repression will suppress DUX4 expression in FSHD muscle and decrease, or reverse, the progression of disease. The specific goal of the project is to identify compounds, their mechanisms of action, and their pre-clinical efficacy in suppressing DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. This will be accomplished by: Aim 1, Identify and characterize drug-like compounds that enhance the epigenetic repression of D4Z4 and suppress DUX4 expression; Aim 2, Determine the pathways and sequences necessary for D4Z4 epigenetic repression; and Aim 3, perform preclinical development of oligonucleotides to enhance repression of D4Z4 and DUX4 expression. Together these aims will identify compounds, their mechanisms of action, and their pre-clinical efficacy in suppressing DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. The significance of these studies is that they will identify compounds, their mechanisms of action, and their pre-clinical efficacy in suppressing DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle. The health relatedness is that these studies will provide the basis for future human clinical studies in FSHD."
"9253186","Significance of Research: Exo Dynamics seeks to develop a novel active spinal orthosis that will enhance the outcomes of bracing treatment for the most common osteoporotic spinal fractures. The goal is to create a device that will enhance outcomes through monitored use, and provide consistent, continuous support through a complete range of motion (ROM). This device may reduce pain, enhance mobility, lead to a higher quality of life, and reduce the rate of subsequent fractures for patients exiting bracing treatment. Description of the Problem: Patients may exit current bracing treatment with suboptimal mobility and reduced strength in their lower backs due to orthosis-imposed immobilization. Currently, patients are instructed to undergo a ?weaning? process near the end of treatment to counter these effects, but a reliance on patient discipline and crude methods often yields mixed results. Description of Technology and Long Term Goal: Unlike existing passive braces, the proposed brace (or orthosis) will incorporate a closed-loop electromechanical control and actuation system to monitor whether a patient is using the brace, and provide time-dependent adjustment of ROM and perceived stiffness, allowing automated bracing and weaning for spinal Compression Burst Fracture (CBF) patients. The goal is to bring to market this novel medical device with the potential to automate and customize bracing treatment for this large (and growing) patient population, as well as improving ROM, strength, pain levels, and subsequent fractures. Phase I Hypothesis and Specific Aims: An active back brace, a thoracolumbosacral spinal orthosis (TLSO), can be constructed that is capable of supporting 1.5 times the mass of the upper body of a person throughout a specified ROM, and can be worn for two weeks during a simulated bracing and weaning protocol with no visible signs of skin breakdown. The proposed work is organized into three specific aims: the first tests the load-bearing and maneuverability of the mechanical portions of the device, the second tests the active-response support behavior of the electronic control system, and the third is a trial with a small pool of healthy human subjects wearing the device throughout a ?compressed? simulated treatment protocol lasting two weeks. Plans for Phase II: The design of the prototype orthosis will be finalized, incorporating Phase I results. A randomized control study of up to 90 patients in 3 groups (control, standard bracing followed by prototype weaning, prototype bracing and weaning) will then be conducted to study the efficacy of the proposed orthosis. Commercial Application: Up to 750,000 CBFs occur annually in the United States, resulting in up to $18 billion in treatment costs. Nearly 20% of all CBF patients will experience one or more additional fractures within one year of treatment. The spinal orthosis market is projected to be $264.7 million (of which $82.7 million is for custom-fabricated devices) in 2016. Exo Dynamics will assemble and distribute the devices through orthotics & prosthetics centers, with acquisition by an established leader as a potential exit."
"9202679","This program aims to develop a novel storage method for human ovarian tissue and whole ovaries, which can also be applied to testicular tissue and gonadal preservation as well as a variety of cells, tissues, and whole organs. This multi-pronged approach builds on recent advances in machine perfusion, nature-inspired cytoprotection strategies, and non-toxic cryoprotectant solutions, combining them with our novel method for constant-volume, pressure- assisted cooling. Our method promises to achieve vitrification of living tissues without the aid of toxic concentrations of cryoprotectants, in a system at thermodynamic equilibrium and potentially at temperatures as high as -70C. It ameliorates or entirely circumvents many of the limitations of conventional cryopreservation methods for large tissues, including damaging ice crystallization, deleterious changes in solute concentrations, and volumetric changes. This approach has the potential to enable indefinite banking of ovarian tissues, whole ovaries, and other living materials while dramatically limiting tissue injury currently associated with ex-vivo storage.  The technical objective of this Phase 1 proposal is to develop an optimized cocktail and protocol for preservation and indefinite banking of ovarian tissue strips. We will develop our method across three specific aims. In Aim 1, will use well established methods developed in one of our labs for comprehensive thermodynamic characterization of novel, nature-inspired cryoprotectant solutions in an isochoric (constant-volume) system; this will allow us to select solutions that allow for pressure-assisted vitrification of living materials at low to intermediate pressures and much higher temperatures than traditionally needed for ice-free cryopreservation. In Aim 2, we select the most effective cryoprotectant solutions established in Aim 1 to optimize our ?high sub-zero vitrification? in a cell-based model for ovarian tissue consisting of human primary ovarian epithelial cells, human primary ovarian granulosa cells, and human endothelial cells; using high-throughput combinatorial testing, we will select protocols which maximize cell viability and improve on current preservation standards. In Aim 3, we will test our optimized protocols for the preservation of human ovarian cortical tissue strips, along with one of the most successful protocols for ovarian tissue freezing and for ovarian tissue vitrification, respectively; we will additionally test the augmentation of these methods with subnormothermic machine perfusion, enabling further reduction of ischemic tissue injury. Success of these novel approaches individually or in combination will likely enable breakthroughs in clinical oncofertility and biopreservation."
"9151022","Project Summary / Abstract The failure of humans to respond to auditory medical alarms has resulted in numerous patient injuries and deaths and is thus a major safety concern. The widely used IEC 60601-1-8 international medical alarm standard was created to improve alarm discernibility and identi?cation. It gives designers a collection of reserved sounds for use in common alarm conditions as well as instructions for designing new alarm sounds. Unfortunately, the melodic tonal patterns of IEC 60601-1-8's alarms are particularly susceptible to simultaneous masking, a condition where concurrent sounds interact in ways that make one or more of them imperceptible due to physical limitations of human perception. This is very dangerous because humans can only respond to medical alarms they can perceive. Detecting masking experimentally can be very dif?cult because it may only occur for very speci?c combinations of multiple alarms and temporal overlaps between them. To address this, we developed a novel computational method that uses formal modeling, psychophysical modeling, and veri?cation analyses to mathematically prove whether a con?guration of medical alarms can produce masking. In this work, we will update this method to enable its use in the evaluation of the masking potential of IEC 60601-1-8 medical alarms. We will then use the method to analyze the standard and identify changes to it that will prevent masking from occurring. In doing this, we will accomplish three speci?c aims. First, we will extend the method to include features not currently supported by it. This will include accounting for sub-frequencies in IEC 60601-1-8 alarm tones and the ability to search through the standard's open parameters. Second, we will use the extended method to evaluate the reserved alarms of IEC 60601-1-8 and identify open parameters within the standard that will avoid masking. Third, we will develop a procedure that engineers can use with the method to analyze and design IEC 60601-1-8-compliant alarms that will avoid masking. This project has the potential to profoundly impact patient safety. By exposing a signi?cant problem with IEC 60601-1-8, we will have identi?ed dangerous conditions that will need to be addressed. By giving engineers the information they need to design standard-compliant devices that help ensure the perceivability of alarms, newly created or updated medical devices will be safer than those from previous generations. Ultimately, by increasing the chance that medical alarms are perceivable, the responsible human will be more likely to respond appropriately and thus protect patients from preventable death and injury."

"9253164","PROJECT SUMMARY OBJECTIVES 795,000 Americans experience a CVA yearly. More intensive rehabilitation early sub-acute post-CVA was found to produce better recovery. The first objective is the development of a relatively low- cost medical device with small clinical footprint. The BrightArm C (BAC) is a compact robotic table with bimanual hand controllers that track full 3D arm movement, measure finger grasp and extension, arm pronation/supination, and monitor health through biosensors. UE movements will be induced during interaction with virtual games. The second objective is to determine the efficacy of BAC for the in-patient and outpatient therapy continuum compared to standard of care. We expect that the new integrative therapy, when added to conventional rehabilitation will result in higher functioning individuals for the same time period. SPECIFIC AIMS 1) Develop the BrightArm C robotic table with novel UE controllers and custom integrative games. Conduct a usability and a feasibility study with Roosevelt Care Center on inpatients sub-acute post- CVA. 2) Longitudinal randomized clinical study of 24 subjects sub-acute post-CVA, inpatients and then outpatients at Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation. Enroll 24 caregivers and obtain their periodic feedback. METHODS 1) Complete mechanical and electronic design of the robotic table, construct a prototype, preform operational testing and validate UE tracking over the entire table. 2) Design and fabricate forearm controllers measuring grasp strength and finger extension, forearm pronation/supination and integrated biosensors. Develop arm position modeling and conduct reliability testing. 3) Interface UE movements captured by hand controllers with an enhanced game library. Integrative games will train motor function and cognitive domains of executive function, memory, focusing and language comprehension. 4) Conduct a usability evaluation on elderly volunteers. 5) Conduct a feasibility study with 6 inpatients early sub-acute post-CVA, showing good technology acceptance and clinical benefit. 6) Build and deploy two BrightArm C systems at Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation, one for subjects in the sub-acute phase post-CVA training 2-3 weeks inpatient and one for outpatients training 2-3 months (2-3x/week). 7) Compare outcomes of experimental (n=16) and control groups (n=8), both undergoing standardized evaluations in the motor, cognitive and quality of life domains. Evaluate pre-/post-inpatient and pre-/post/follow-up -outpatient therapy. Success means better outcomes for experimental group, with an average of 5 points larger increase in Fugl-Mayer assessment, average 6 point more in CAHAI-9, larger increase in executive function, memory, and a 5 point larger reduction in depression. Periodically collect caregiver feedback to determine generalization to independence in real-life activities. NIH RELEVANCE: Nationwide annual costs of CVAs are expected to grow to $240 billion by 2030. This project will reduce these costs by improving ADL function, cognition and quality of life through early, intensive intervention post-CVA. Individuals post TBI, cerebral palsy, or post shoulder surgery may also benefit."
"9151840","Project Summary The discoveries of primary sensory receptors that mediate our external senses of smell, touch, taste, and vision were landmark achievements. In contrast, internal sensory systems of the vagus nerve are vastly understudied at a molecular level, with primary sensory receptors unknown in any organ system. The vagus nerve is a major conduit between brain and body that controls feeding behavior, respiration, blood pressure, metabolism, heart rate, nausea, and cough. Mechanosensory and chemosensory transduction mechanisms in the vagus nerve present tremendously important problems in sensory biology. Sensory receptors that detect meal-induced stomach distension, blood pressure at the aortic arch, lung expansion during breathing, irritants that cause cough, or chemotherapeutics that induce nausea are unknown. Understanding how the vagus nerve signals at a molecular level is relevant for a wide range of clinical conditions, including obesity, diabetes, colitis, asthma, nausea, depression, and epilepsy. The goals of this project are to identify primary sensory receptors of the vagus nerve that survey internal organ state. Initial efforts will focus on finding stomach and lung mechanoreceptors as well as aortic baroreceptors, and work could be extended to identify irritant and toxin receptors that evoke cough and nausea. Vagal mechanoreceptors will be identified using a novel in vivo ganglion imaging approach that permits analysis of single neuron responses to internal organ stimuli. In vivo ganglion imaging is compatible with mosaic loss-of-function approaches like RNAi for analysis of gene function. Deconstructing the sensory biology of vagal afferents will reveal basic insights into how autonomic physiology is controlled by the nervous system, and may provide new opportunities for therapy design. This proposal builds on years of foundational work, and is not supportable by traditional funding mechanisms due to the large project scope, the risk associated with receptor-identification studies, and my limited publication record in this new field. So far, our early work in this system has characterized sensory neuron types in different physiological systems (Cell, 2015). Funding would enable new molecular-level efforts to identify primary sensory receptor proteins that detect internal sensory cues."

However, the estimated participation rate for cervical cancer screening in Senegal (where incidence peaks between the ages of 45 and 54) is very low. Ten of the 13 rural Senegal regions remain with no access to cervical cancer screening services, even though screening by visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid is highly effective and affordable. Since 2010, I, Andrew Dykens MD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Family Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), have led a partnership between the Kedougou Regional health system, the Institute of Health and Development, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the U.S. Peace Corps to implement a visual inspection cervical cancer screening program in this far southeastern, rural region. The partnership made a screening service available to over 18,300 women region-wide by 2014. However, the utilization by eligible women, especially the high-risk older cohort, remains very low. In 2014, only 509, roughly 5% of eligible women targeted through a mass campaign that year, were screened and only 10% were 45 years or older. This career development award will provide me with critical research skills through a mentored project that will expand our current research. My research proposal aims to address preliminary data describing poor uptake and barriers to screening access in this region through a multi-level mixed methods assessment of the barriers and facilitators of initial uptake. This knowledge will guide us in developing and adapting a peer education health promotion intervention to this specific context in order to demonstrate an increased rate of initial screenings and re-screenings over time. Using mixed methods, we will 1) assess cervical cancer screening access determinants in Kedougou, Senegal by identifying barriers and facilitators of service uptake over time at the person, household, and community levels; 2) develop and deploy a wide-reaching, multi-level responsive peer education curriculum aimed at motivating eligible women to seek cervical cancer screenings in Kedougou, Senegal; and 3) evaluate the impact of the peer education intervention on initial screening uptake and re-screening rates. The support provided by this mentored career development award will allow me to achieve my goal of becoming an independent implementation researcher with expertise in evaluating the access determinants for a cervical cancer screening program in a rural region of Senegal and designing and evaluating a behavioral change intervention. I will develop the necessary experience to strengthen and scale cervical cancer prevention programs in Senegal and other low- and middle-income countries, reduce barriers to cervical cancer diagnosis, and implement evidence-based screening approaches in real world settings. To achieve this goal, I have assembled an outstanding group of mentors including my primary mentors, Marian Fitzgibbon, PhD, who directs UIC's National Cancer Institute funded Cancer Education and Career Development Program, and Abdoul Aziz Kassé MD, an NIH funded epidemiologist and Professor of Gynecology Oncology at the University of Cheikh Anta Diop Cancer Institute. In addition, a team of NIH funded co-mentors will provide expertise specific to my training objectives: Jennifer Smith PhD is an expert in global cervical cancer epidemiology and an affiliate in the CDC Global Network of which I am a part, Michael Berbaum PhD is a professor of biostatistics at UIC and faculty with the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research through which I will seek additional coursework, Stevan Weine MD is an expert on multi-level mixed methods research with extensive experience in international settings and is the Director of Research at the UIC Center for Global Health, of which I am a core member. Through direct mentorship I will develop my knowledge and skills in 1) epidemiology, 2) behavioral change and health promotion, 3) quantitative analysis of multi-level longitudinal data, and 4) mixed methods research. I intend to establish an implementation science research career developing scalable cervical cancer control and prevention programs in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), translating evidence-based screening approaches to real world settings, building LMIC research capacity in implementation science, applying cancer prevention strategies in relation to local culture and local resources, and mentoring future cancer prevention health services implementation researchers. I have demonstrated extensive commitment to our partnership in Senegal since 2010, have developed a highly supportive collaborative network within and external to Senegal, and am personally committed to a career studying the access determinants, capacity implementation, and sustainability of cervical cancer prevention services in the far southeastern region of Kedougou. The lessons learned there through the introduction and strengthening of a cervical cancer screening program will be transferrable in providing access to and empowering the nearly 1,000,000 screening-eligible (ages 30 to 59) women throughout rural Senegal. Through short-term success, we will develop an evidence-based context-specific and culturally sensitive cervical cancer educational curriculum with materials in all local languages. This will facilitate long-term success as we establish an extensive network of educators and a baseline comprehension of cervical cancer in rural Senegal. This groundwork will be critical and is easily expanded to incorporate future efforts such as population-level vaccination programs. This will greatly facilitate opportunities in future years to conduct larger epidemiologic studies to guide the specific targeting of high-risk HPV subtypes through future vaccination programs. I would welcome similar research in other West African countries or other LMICs globally where there continues to be high cervical cancer incidence rates, nonexistent or inaccessible services, and gaps in understanding how to successfully and sustainably implement cervical cancer prevention services."
"9239056","The purpose of this study is to extend our prior work in understanding the risk structure of hospital readmissions and the impact of post-operative services for patients with joint replacement surgery on their physical functioning. We propose to take advantage of a unique patient-specific data sources (the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) both linked to Medicare claims data for patient-level measures of functional status, mobility limitations and social support to enhance current claims- data based risk models for both hospital readmissions and to understand the impact of different post-operative services on subsequent physical functioning. Using statewide Medicare claims data, we will also explore the use of census-derived variables that could serve as surrogate measures of the HRS and NHATS variables of functional status, mobility and social support that could be readily implemented as enhancements to nationwide claims data. Finally, we propose to study the impact of the ?bundle? of services provided during the CMS defined post operative period and the effect those services have on patients' measured physical function. Our goal remains to protect vulnerable patients and the hospitals they frequent while providing the correct value signal to the health system.   "
"9353949","Hierarchical feedforward models have provided a foundation for most theories of visual processing over the past 40 years. However, in the cerebral cortex there is a dense network of feedback (FB) connections sending topdown information from higher to lower processing centers. The anatomy and function of FB circuits is still poorly understood. This is despite the fact that FB has been implicated in many important visual functions such as contextual modulation, attention and learning. The goal of this application is to understand the anatomical and functional organization of FB connections from the secondary (V2) to the primary visual cortex (V1), and the impact of V2 FB on V1 cell responses. We will test the following hypotheses: 1. Anatomically, V2 FB consists of parallel channels, related to the stripe compartments of V2, with each channel targeting specific V1 layers, V1 compartments and the same V1 cells that provide input to the specific V2 stripe (Aim 1). The different channels also show unique specificities with respect to the functional maps of visual stimulus properties in V1 (Aim 2). 2. Functionally, V2 FB contributes to surround modulation (SM) caused by visual stimulation of the surround regions near the V1 cell?s receptive field (RF) (Aim 3). SM is the ability of stimuli in the RF surround to modulate the responses of V1 cells to stimuli inside the RF, a property thought to serve efficient coding of natural images and segmentation of object boundaries (Nurminen & Angelucci, 2014) Ref43. Our understanding of FB anatomy and function has been hampered by the technical limitations of previous methods used to label FB axons and manipulate their activity. Conventional tracers are either poorly sensitive or label axons bidirectionally, creating a confound in the interpretation of the axon label. As a result, there are conflicting reports regarding the anatomical and functional specificity of FB connections. Inactivation of FB systems has been performed using methods that lack spatiotemporal precision and cell type selectivity, affecting cells in an entire cortical area. These approaches could not rule out that the effects of FB manipulation were mediated by other indirect pathways. To overcome these limitations, we will investigate the anatomical and functional organization of FB connections from V2 to V1, using novel viral-mediated expression of fluorescent proteins to label FB axons and their synaptic terminals unambiguously. In Aim 1 these labeling  methods will be combined with staining of V1 layers and compartment (CO maps), and in Aim 2 with optical imaging of V1 functional maps. In Aim 3, manipulation of FB neuron activity will be performed using optogenetic activation of opsin-expressing FB axons, while determining the effects of these manipulations on spontaneous and visually-evoked spike activity in V1 cells, recorded using linear arrays. These data will providean anatomical and mechanistic foundation for modeling and hypothesis-driven studies of FB function and dysfunction, and lead to a better understanding of the computations performed by this canonical cortical circuit, i.e. topdown FB."
"9149095","Project Summary / Abstract: Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)  The conduct of cancer clinical trials is central to the scientific mission of the University of Arizona Cancer  Center (UACC). The development and implementation of a broad portfolio of cancer trials requires an  extensive institutional commitment of scientific, operational, and patient resources; thus, oversight of the  scientific merit and progress of the trial portfolio is paramount in ensuring that trial outcomes help shape the  future of cancer prevention and treatment. The internal oversight of the scientific aspects of all cancer trials  and the monitoring of the progress of cancer trials research is managed by the UACC Protocol Review and  Monitoring System (PRMS). The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) serves as the principal functional  component of the PRMS; it is the chartered, multidisciplinary body charged with the ultimate review of the  scientific merit, prioritization, and progress of all cancer trials proposed by UACC Principal Investigators, with  the exception of those trials that have undergone external peer-review through NIH and its funding agencies.  The SRC membership is composed of a broad spectrum of specialists in cancer treatment, cancer prevention,  therapeutic development, and basic and population science that mirrors the breadth of the UACC's clinical trial  portfolio. Cancer trials are risk-stratified for determination of need for full Committee versus administrative  expedited review. A systematic process is in place for the monitoring of accrual to trials and of trial scientific  progress. The SRC has the authority to terminate trials that have not met pre-specified accrual targets or that  are not meeting their scientific objectives. The PRMS performance metrics are generated by the clinical  research system OnCore® and provide the basis for PRMS quality improvement initiatives."
"9229982","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To respond to the HIV epidemic and reduce health disparities in HIV incidence and outcomes, we propose a Prevention Research Center (PRC) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) that facilitates significant and innovative health science research through partnerships with public health colleagues that ultimately improves public health. The HIV epidemic continues to be a major public health crisis in the U.S., with more than 1 million people living with HIV and more than 50,000 becoming newly infected every year1. Given the progress in preventing and treating HIV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified HIV as a winnable battle, Healthy People 2020 has included HIV as a topic area, sexual health is part of the National Prevention Strategy, and the White House has made HIV a policy priority with the release of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. HIV has had a disproportionate impact on African Americans, representing one of the largest health disparities in the U.S. While comprising just 13% of the total national population, African Americans account for 51% of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. While HIV disproportionately impacts African Americans, Black gay and other men who have sex with men (BMSM) are particularly impacted. In particular young BMSM (aged 13 - 24 years) are the only subpopulation where the rate of new infections continues to increase. These national data highlight the urgent need to focus research on eliminating HIV health disparities among African Americans in general and BMSM in particular. This application proposes to develop and implement authentic community engagement and support implementation of a research project that focuses on linking, engaging and reengaging in care young BMSM living with HIV. Our overall aims are to:  1. Establish a Prevention Research Center that focuses on appropriate adaptation, dissemination and  implementation of HIV health disparities research for application to policy, programs and practices;  2. Enhance collaborations with partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies,  institutions and universities to facilitate innovative, high-impact, multidisciplinary HIV research and  knowledge translation to training, programs, practices and policies;  3. Increase the capacity of partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies,  institutions and universities to understand and implement the findings from HIV research through  targeted training, communication and dissemination; and  4. Develop an implementation research portfolio that translates and adapts an evidence-based  intervention into practice settings. We propose to begin this portfolio by studying the implementation of an evaluated intervention to improve linkage of HIV-infected young Black MSM to clinical care."
"9169958","Project Summary/Abstract The Harvard University TH Chan School of Public Health, in partnership with the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, propose a comprehensive program of research, education and training in the management of hazards associated with emerging technologies. The proposal includes two new graduate level Master of Public Health degree programs, internship opportunities for undergraduate and graduate trainees, support for pilot research projects on hazards of new and emerging technologies, research in development and application of new detection technologies, and professional continuing education and distance learning programs. The program will prepare professional practitioners and researchers to address the evaluation, handling, and management of hazardous substances and conditions associated with emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, electronic waste, drug delivery in healthcare, and sustainable remediation. The overall objectives of the proposed research education program are fourfold: to develop an academic curriculum on occupational health and safety and hazardous substances and leadership in sustainability and environmental management related to emerging technologies; to train a cohort of students in graduate (MPH degree) programs, as well as executive and professional continuing education and distance learning on hazards associated with emerging technologies; to disseminate the results and findings of this research and education; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the training provided. The research education program will provide traineeships to program participants recruited from undergraduate institutions with particular emphasis on under-represented populations, as well as full-time trainees in the graduate (MPH) programs. Research opportunities on hazards associated with new and emerging technologies will be supported through the pilot project program, and we will research development and application of new detection technologies through the Harvard Sensors for Health project. The research education program will be developed in consultation with and evaluated by the HSPH Office of Educational Programs and the Committee on Educational Policy, as well as an external advisory board comprised of stakeholders in health and safety considerations of emerging technologies including academics, business and industry, government, labor, and not-for-profit organizations. This consultation and evaluation will assure that the research education is relevant to the Superfund Research Program's commitment to short courses, continuing education, and graduate training on health and safety management practices for emerging technologies."
"9207239","While the epidemic of HIV in the US has leveled off for many age groups, from 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) (13-24 year old) more than doubled. In 2010, YMSM accounted for 72% of new infections among people ages 13 to 24, and 30% of all new infections among MSM. The success of treatment as prevention in reducing the number of new HIV infections among youth, and particularly YMSM, relies on HIV testing, antiretroviral treatment (both for treatment and prevention), adherence and viral suppression among those with HIV. The UNC/Emory Center for Innovative Technology (iTech) aims to impact the HIV epidemic by conducting innovative, interdisciplinary research on technology-based interventions across the HIV prevention and care continuum for adolescents and young adults in the United States (US). The iTech also creates an infrastructure to share and disseminate best practices in technology-delivered HIV interventions to other ATN projects and programs serving adolescents. The iTech overall goals seek to decrease the impact of HIV on the lives of adolescents and young adults in the US, particularly YMSM, by providing: 1) treatment as prevention for those without HIV but at risk; 2) earlier identification and treatment for those infected but undiagnosed; 3) interventions to address structural determinants that decrease access to and uptake of prevention and care services; and 4) treatment interventions to encourage adherence for youth dealing with substance use, mental health related issues, stigmatization and disenfranchisement. The necessary resources and support for HIV/AIDS investigators addressing these goals will be provided by the iTech Cores: 1) Management (Hightow-Weidman); 2) Analytic (Rosenberg/Muessig); and, 3) Technology (Sullivan/Hightow-Weidman). To accomplish our Overall Goals we have developed the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To provide scientific leadership with expertise and experience in technology-based research to address fundamental questions related to the HIV prevention and care continuum, guide our overall research strategy and foster collaboration and synergy both within our iTech and with the broader ATN scientific community. Aim 2: To support the development and assessment of innovative technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for at-risk or infected youth aged 15-24 years. Aim 3: To support the overall ATN scientific agenda by participating on the ATN Executive Committee and collaborating with other U19 awardees stimulating new synergistic and responsive grants applications and research to respond to emerging issues in this field. Aim 4: To develop and nurture partnerships that will ensure community input at all stages of conceptualization, design, implementation, and interpretation of the research. Aim 5. To develop, mentor and train clinicians and researchers to stimulate innovative HIV/AIDS research focused on technological innovation across the care continuum."
"9207983","Acute lung injury can result from irritant chemical exposure released from terrorists' attacks including the intentional detonation of chemical plants, railroad car derailments, or chemical truck hijacking. Often fatal, an initial diagnosis of acute lung injury can be difficult because the onset of signs and symptoms can be delayed hours or days after exposure. Histologically, acute lung injury is marked by epithelial and endothelial injury that leads to delayed pulmonary edema with surfactant disruption, alveolar collapse, respiratory failure, and ultimately, death. Based on its toxicity and industrial usage, acrolein is one of the chemicals of high concern to the counterACT program. Lethal acrolein exposures have resulted following accidental release during transportation and use. Terrorists? attacks often produce massive fires that also can result in acrolein exposure, as well as, carbon monoxide (CO) exposure. Current acute lung injury treatment is limited to supportive strategies (managed ventilation and supplied oxygen). Importantly, many people are likely to be exposed to concentrations that are not immediately lethal. In these individuals, pulmonary edema can be delayed for many hours and occur with no initial symptoms. Thus, the majority of victims will be difficult to diagnose and health care systems may be overwhelmed because patients cannot be triaged adequately. Treating individuals after exposure but before symptoms develop provides a window of opportunity to prevent or diminish delayed pulmonary edema. This proposal seeks to develop therapeutic countermeasures that are effective and safe for use in the prevention and treatment of delayed pulmonary edema induced by acrolein, CO, and acrolein plus CO and thereby reduce mortality."
"8998410","Project Summary  The Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) has a long and successful track record of conducting innovative pilot and  Phase I clinical trials, including studies targeting specific molecular pathways relevant to cancer, angiogenesis  inhibition, cell-based therapy, and stem cell transplantation. Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS)  has been particularly helpful in supporting the conduct of high priority, innovative, pilot and/or Phase I clinical  trials. The pilot and Phase I trials that receive funding via this mechanism are of the highest priority for the ACC  as they often lay the groundwork for future efficacy studies. Trials supported by EPCRS include both traditional  ?investigator-initiated? studies of short duration (e.g., 1-2 years) and studies that result from collaborations with  industry in which the ACC investigator is the primary contributor to the design and conduct of the trial and often  has conducted the preclinical research that provided the rationale for the study.  The primary focus of EPCRS during the project period has been to enable the conduct of innovative early  phase trials. Funds have been used to support oncology research nurses and data managers for qualified,  carefully selected trials. Studies supported by EPCRS, while highly meritorious, are often unfunded or under-  funded, and thus unable to cover research nursing and/or data management costs adequately without such  support. In addition, EPCRS funded studies are generally complex, and usually include novel biological  correlative studies requiring expert study coordination. Consistent with this complexity, the EPCRS-supported  research nurses and data managers are among our most highly trained staff. EPCRS enables this core group  of experienced professionals to support ACC investigators in conducting ground-breaking translational  research studies in a manner that responds to the needs of the investigators and matches the technical  demands of the individual studies."
"9071751","PROJECT SUMMARY ? RADIATION BIOLOGY PROGRAM  The Program in Radiation Biology is focused on ways in which the effectiveness of radiotherapy can  increase both local tumor control and the survival of cancer patients. The members of this program  investigate new ways to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy by targeting the tumor microenvironment,  protecting normal tissue from radiation toxicity, and developing new technology to deliver radiation in a  focused manner at high speed. To achieve these goals, basic discovery science, high throughput  screening and preclinical models are used to obtain critical supporting data to take these approaches  into clinical trials. Thus, the program includes both basic and translational science. Program research is  focused on two major scientific aims:  Aim 1: To develop pharmacologic and biologic agents to combine with radiotherapy to improve  local tumor control and prevent metastatic spread. These studies are focused on developing new  approaches to improve local control with radiotherapy, protect normal tissues from radiation toxicity,  and identify genetic determinants that influence the response of tumors to DNA damage and modulate  tissue integrity.  Aim 2: To develop new approaches to administer radiotherapy or combined modality therapy to  test in clinical trials. These investigations employ diverse approaches that include the use of functional  imaging to more selectively deliver radiotherapy, expand the uses of hypofractionated radiotherapy, and  develop new technologies that can deliver high-energy electrons in less than a second.  The program is co-led by Amato Giaccia, PhD and Quynh Le, MD. The 25 members of this program  represent the School of Medicine and the School of Humanities and Sciences, and are supported by  peer-reviewed research totaling $8.0M, including 21 R01s, 1P01s, and 2 T32s. Peer-reviewed funding  consists of $4.7M from the NCI, other NIH support amounts to $2.5M, and other peer-reviewed support  to $0.9M. The members of this program are highly motivated and interactive in their goal to take  fundamental discoveries in the laboratory and develop them to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy to  control tumor growth and metastasis. Since 2009, members of the Radiation Biology Program  published 450 manuscripts, a near doubling from the last submission. Of these, 31% represent intra-  programmatic collaborations and 33% represent inter-programmatic collaborations. The Stanford  Cancer Institute enhances the program's goals by providing state-of-the-art shared resources, seed  grant support for new projects, programmatic funds, retreats, special seminars, and support for new  recruitments. The support from the SCI has been instrumental in promoting both intra- and inter-  programmatic collaborations that were essential for the renewal of our program project grant on tumor  hypoxia, the development of a new program project grant on tissue radioprotection, and the renewal of  our T32 training grant to train postdoctoral fellows."
"9328299","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD."
"9235988","Project Summary: The Shh pathway plays critical roles in development, stem cell maintenance and tissue homeostasis. Deregulated Shh signaling during cerebellar development causes medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain tumors in childhood with presumed cellular origin in granule cell precursors (GCPs). During postnatal development, GCPs undergo rapid and transient proliferation in the outer external granule layer (EGL) in response to Shh signaling before differentiating and migrating inward to become granule neurons. Persistent Shh signaling counters this stereotypic developmental pattern, resulting in disrupted differentiation and prolonged stay of GCPs in the outer EGL where cerebellar neoplasm is thought to initiate. Therefore, elucidating the mechanism by which CGP proliferation and differentiation are regulated is important to our understanding of cerebellar tumorigenesis. Deregulated cellular growth and proliferation are hallmarks of neoplasms that entail energy-consuming anabolic processes such as protein synthesis and lipogenesis. These anabolic processes are highly regulated and subject to stringent control by cellular energy sensors. The key energy sensor that is activated under condition of energy depletion is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We discovered that AMPK is a potent inhibitor of Shh signaling in GCPs and primary medulloblastoma cells. Moreover, AMPK is selectively activated in the inner EGL of the developing cerebellum where Shh signaling is downregulated and GCPs have begun differentiating. These observations suggest that AMPK may play a critical role in modulating Shh signaling in GCPs for differentiation, proliferation and tumorigenesis. We will test this hypothesis by three aims: 1) Elucidate the mechanism by which AMPK activation antagonizes Shh pathway activity; 2) Determine the role of AMPK in modulating GCP proliferation and differentiation in vivo; 3) Determine the effect of AMPK activation in Shh-driven medulloblastoma in vivo."

Racial disparities in these behaviors and associated health outcomes present major public health challenges. The specific aims of the USC PRC for 2014-2019 build on a long and successful history of applied research and practice in underserved communities: 1) grow the Center infrastructure; 2) engage communities, state and local health departments, and other stakeholders to inform our activities; 3) implement an integrated set of strategies to disseminate Center research findings, products, and programs; 4) contribute to the development of skilled community members and public health professionals through training and technical assistance; 5) evaluate Center activities and outcomes; and 6) conduct an applied public health prevention research project. Achievement of these aims will lead to the following long-term outcomes: 1) increased translation of research into practice and policy; 2) improved environmental and system-wide strategies; 3) widespread use of evidence-based programs and policies; 4) enhanced community capacity for health promotion and disease prevention; 5) increased skilled public health professionals and community members; 6) expanded resources for applied public health research; and 7) increased recognition of and support for USC PRC research and activities. The USC PRC's applied research project will study the dissemination and implementation of an evidence-based program shown previously to significantly increase physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake in churches in South Carolina (Faith, Activity, and Nutrition; FAN). Guided by two theoretical frameworks, the specific aims of the applied research project are to: 1) examine the adoption and reach of FAN in churches and organizational factors associated with adoption; 2) characterize implementation fidelity and multilevel factors associated with implementation; 3) describe organizational maintenance of FAN and factors associated with maintenance; and 4) study the effectiveness of FAN. In Phase 1, we will randomize churches in a rural county with a high proportion of African American residents to receive training in FAN from a community health advisor (n=40) or to be part of a delayed intervention control group (n=20). This phase will allow us to study dissemination and implementation in a range of diverse religious denominations and gain greater understanding of how local coalitions can reach faith-based communities as settings for intervention. In Phase 2, we will work with two large faith denominations in SC, including one that is predominantly African American, to disseminate the program statewide. This phase will allow us to identify key considerations in program dissemination, adoption, and implementation and to examine the potential for broader geographic dissemination. Increasing physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption are important goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles and the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's environmental approach to preventing chronic disease and promoting health."

"9142280","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allergies affect one in five Americans and are the 5th leading chronic disease in the U.S. Each year, allergies account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits. Although documenting and exchanging allergy information in electronic health records (EHRs) is becoming increasingly important, we still face multiple challenges. These include: lack of well-adopted standard terminologies for representing allergies, frequent entry of allergy information as free-text, and no existing process for reconciling allergy information. In this study, we will provide solutions to these challenges by addressing the following specific aims: 1) conduct analyses on standard terminologies and a large allergy repository to build a comprehensive knowledge base for representing allergy information; 2) design, develop and evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) module for extracting and encoding free-text allergy information and integrate it with an existing NLP system; 3) measure the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed NLP system for the new process of allergy reconciliation; and 4) distribute our methods and tool, so they are widely available to other researchers and healthcare institutions for non-commercial use."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study documented a 31% increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) between 2001 and 2009, as well as an increase of 21 % in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in youth diagnosed at age<20. Increases occurred across most but not all major subgroups of age, sex and race/ethnicity. Further, we documented an annual increase in the incidence of T1D among non-Hispanic white youth of approximately 2.7% per year. In contrast, studies from Europe suggest that incidence of T1D may be stabilizing. Ongoing, efficient surveillance of diabetes diagnosed in youth is essential to inform health care systems and generate testable hypotheses related to the natural history of diabetes in youth. SEARCH is uniquely positioned to address these critical questions through continued surveillance of childhood diabetes employing our well-established infrastructure for surveillance, and our highly experienced, collaborative and multi-disciplinary investigative team. Therefore, in response to RFA-DP-15-002, Component B, we propose the continuation of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry Study (SEARCH Phase 4) during which we will continue to serve as the Coordinating Center (CC). Our approach is informed by our substantial accrued experience that allows us to provide statistical and operational leadership in a highly efficient manner. The overarching aim of the CC is to support the population based registries of Component A described in the RFA, specifically the activities of the surveillance network and the validation of diabetes cases. The main objectives of the registries are to ascertain, among youth diagnosed at age < 20 years, cases of prevalent diabetes in calendar year 2017; ascertain newly diagnosed (2015-2020) incident diabetes cases; confirm classification of diabetes type using biochemical markers; and optimize efficiency of the surveillance activities through targeted projects designed to utilize relevant electronic health data. The main objectives of the CC to support the surveillance network are to: (1) Maintain a central data repository and create protocols and mechanisms to secure transmission of data and relevant data management reports between the CC and the registry sites; (2) Ensure the training and certification of staff on measurements and procedures as outlined in the protocol and manual of operations; (3) Provide expertise and leadership in population-based surveillance development, methodology, implementation, and evaluation; (4) Provide statistical and other analytic support to the registry network; (5) Provide for a central laboratory for the analysis of biological specimens; (6) Provide operational support to the registry network (communication and meetings). The main objectives of the CC to support the validation of diabetes cases are to: (1) Develop analytic methods for case validation; (2) Provide statistical/analytic support for validation analysis; (3) Maintain diabetes case validation protocols. Thus, the CC is uniquely positioned to provide leadership in statistical and operational issues that will support continued collection of data on the prevalence, incidence and early clinical course of diabetes in youth."
"9199143","SUMMARY Rationale. The proposed project seeks methods to prevent and elucidate biomarkers of neurocognition and motor deficits associated with chronic dietary reliance on cyanogenic cassava, a staple food crop for more than 600 millions of people living in the tropics. Aim 1 will implement a novel cassava processing method (wetting method, WTM) that safely removes cyanogenic compounds from cassava flour prior to human consumption in a stratified village-cluster randomized non-inferiority trial so as to compare the effectiveness of a peer-led intervention (women training other women in the WTM) with that by community-health worker specialists (2 intervention training arms). We hypothesize that the peer-led WTM intervention is non-inferior to the specialist-led intervention at the end of the 2-year intervention period and at 1-year follow-up. Task shifting to peer-led training for WTM should it prove to be effective, would provide for a more cost-effective and sustainable means to bring this intervention to scale at a community-wide level. Primary outcomes will be the cassava cyanogenic content produced by the trainee mother (N = 200 in each intervention arm) and urinary concentrations of thiocyanate (U-SCN) in her konzo and non-konzo sibling children 5 to 12 years of age. Secondary outcomes will be the neuropsychological performance scores of children assessed using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II) for cognition and the Bruininks/Oseretsky Test (BOT-2) for motor proficiency. Aim 2 will determine whether post-intervention reductions in cassava cyanogenic content and child U-SCN are associated with changes in biomarkers of cassava neurotoxicity particularly 8,12-iso- iPF2?-VI isoprostane (oxidant marker), carbamoylated albumin fragments KVPQVSTPTLVEVSR (residues 438-452) and LDELRDEGKASSAK (residues 206-219), or homocitrulline (carbamoylating markers), and scores at the KABC-II and BOT-2 testing. We hypothesize that 1) lower cassava cyanogenic content and U- SCN throughout the two-year intervention period and at one-year follow-up, will be associated with lower oxidant and carbamoylating markers but higher KABC-II and BOT-2 testing scores; and a similar pattern will be sustained at 1-year follow-up; and 2) higher levels of oxidation and carbamoylation will be associated with poorer neuropsychological performance. Biomarkers will be monitored in serum (invasive), dried blood spots (DBS) (less invasive), or urine (non-invasive) using omic methodologies with the long-term goal of developing field-based rapid tests to monitor risk for cassava associated neurodevelopmental deficits. Aim 3 will enhance the research manpower of the konzo-affected Democratic Republic of Congo."
"9177697","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A TBI produces complex pathophysiology contributing to progressive cellular dysfunction and death that can culminate in impaired motor and cognitive abilities. Despite advances in understanding the multifaceted pathobiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI), no therapeutic has been approved for the treatment of TBI in clinical  trials. Previous work from our lab demonstrates that deficits in acetylcholine release in the hippocampus contribute to the manifestation of neurobehavioral dysfunction after injury, but little  is known about the mechanisms underlying impaired neurotransmission. In the uninjured brain, the formation of the N- ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex facilitates vesicular docking and neurotransmitter release; however, the effects of TBI on the SNARE complex have not been examined. We hypothesize that alterations in the SNARE complex and synaptic vesicle distribution contribute to impaired neurotransmission and behavioral dysfunction after TBI. The proposed work will test the efficacy of lithium to attenuate intrasynaptic impairments, promote synaptic plasticity and cell survival, and improve neurobehavioral function after TBI. To this end, we will utilize rat and mouse models of TBI to examine the therapeutic capacity of lithium. Additionally, we will examine the specificity of lithium's action in the synapse using commercially available cysteine string protein alpha (CSPa) knockout mice. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of lithium on SNARE protein abundance and complex formation at multiple time points after TBI. Additionally, we will examine the effect of lithium on synaptic vesicular distribution and density and neurotransmitter release after TBI by transmission electron microscopy and microdialysis, respectively. In Aim 2, we will examine the effect of lithium on synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neuron survival, and neurobehavioral function in the weeks following TBI. The proposed work will provide the first evaluation of changes in synaptic vesicle distribution and alterations in the SNARE complex after TBI. Successful completion of this work will provide valuable insights into our understanding of synaptic dysfunction and the development of lithium based approaches to promote recovery in the injured brain."
"9175940","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Alterations in cognitive/affective/sleep functioning are among the most challenging side effects experienced by 80% of patients with metastatic melanoma (MM) or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) undergoing high dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy.1 Altered cognition2 includes a wide array of symptoms such as alterations in concentration, attention, short-term memory, confusion, mental fatigue, executive functioning, abstraction, language, basic arithmetic and orientation;3,4 affective symptoms2 include mood alterations, depression, anxiety, psychosis, hallucinations, aggression, suicide ideation and coma;5-7 and sleep symptoms include insomnia (initial, middle, delayed) and hypersomnia.8  Methods: This exploratory, descriptive, mixed methods case study design will describe the trajectory of transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in ten high-dose IL-2 cases. Each IL-2 case consists of the IL-2 patient, care partner, and primary nurse. Through case study analyses, qualitative data from the care partner and nurse will be synthesized with qualitative and quantitative data from the patient to inform and describe the patterns of cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms experienced by the patient during treatment.  The specific aims of this study are to: Aim 1) Describe transient and residual cognitive (language, concentration, confusion, attention, short-term memory, and orientation), affective (depression, anxiety, mood alterations), and sleep (insomnia, hypersomnia) symptoms in patients during up to four hospitalizations for high-dose IL-2 therapy. Aim 2) Describe patient transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms as qualitatively reported by each patient's care partner, and primary nurse during each hospital admission for IL-2 therapy. Aim 3) Describe the trajectory of transient and residual cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms in IL-2 patients over the total number of hospitalizations, synthesizing patient data with care partner and nurse reports of symptom change.  Significance: This will be the first study to describe IL-2-induced cognitive/affective/sleep symptoms longitudinally from the perspective of the individuals experiencing the treatment course: the patient, their care partner, and their nurse. These individuals will describe the trajectory, duration and severity of these symptoms through journaling, interviews, and cognitive/affective/sleep measures. Results from this study will identify critical time points along the symptom trajectory to target interventions. These data will  inform future interventional studies that help patients during periods of aggressive medical treatment, supporting their care partners, and nurses."
"9144977","The halogen bromine (Br2) is used as water disinfectant, for bleaching fibers, for manufacturing antiepileptic drugs, dyestuffs, flame-retardants, insecticides, drilling fluids, and gasoline additives. When inhaled, it causes exposure-level-dependent acute and chronic pulmonary and systemic injuries ranging from mild eye and airway irritation, to significant damage to cardiopulmonary system and other organs, which can lead to death. Survivors may develop reactive airway disease syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis as well as restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases. Presently, there are no studies evaluating acute and chronic sequelae of Br2 inhalation in pregnant rodent and non-rodent models, even though US census bureau data predicts two of every 100 people in the US being pregnant. Exposure of pregnant mice at gestational day 15 (E15) to Br2 (600 ppm for 30 min.) results in 75% mortality over four days, in contrast to 25% mortality in males or non-pregnant females (p<0001). When delivered at E19, fetuses of surviving Br2-exposed mice exhibit severe fetal growth restriction (FGR) and fetal demise (FD). Placentas are poorly developed and express increased levels of short-FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an anti-angiogenic mediator and biomarker of both preeclampsia and pulmonary hypertension. When born naturally, none of the fetuses survive. Oral administration of an FDA- approved type 5 cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDE5i; tadalafil) to the dams post- exposure, dramatically improved maternal survival, fetal growth restriction and neonatal survival. We hypothesize that brominated intermediates, formed by the reaction of Br2 and HOBr with plasmalogens cause injury to the endothelium and the placenta, inducing the release of vasoconstrictor and anti-angiogenic mediators which in turn mediate pulmonary vasoconstriction, increased pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular dysfunction. Tadalafil restores pulmonary and uterine vasodilation, preserves heart function and improves uterine/placental blood supply resulting in maternal and fetal survival. We will test these proposed mechanisms and we will perform the necessary efficacy studies to identify the optimum therapeutic regimen of tadalafil to decrease maternal morbidity and mortality, improve fetal growth restriction and increase fetal survival when administered orally post exposure. Specific Aim #1. To test the hypothesis that exposure of pregnant mice to Br2 at E15 causes extensive pulmonary injury as well as systemic endothelial injury, placental injury, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure resulting in maternal mortality, fetal growth restriction and fetal demise/stillbirth. Specific Aim #2: To identify the sequence of events and mechanisms involved in the development of maternal vasoconstriction, pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Specific Aim #3. To investigate the efficacy of post halogen exposure administration of tadalafil to decrease maternal and fetal death and morbidity and to develop a rabbit (non-rodent) model of Br2 toxicity in pregnancy."
"9270196","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Worldwide, women bear the brunt of the HIV epidemic, and an effective means to prevent HIV transmission to women remains an elusive goal. Achieving this goal is hampered by our incomplete understanding of the early events in the female reproductive tract (FRT) during sexual transmission. In particular, how resident HIV- susceptible and non-susceptible cells affect viral replication, and sense and respond to HIV infection, are not well understood. Although the upper FRT harbors HIV-susceptible cells, is exposed to semen components, and is infected early in SIV transmission models, it is understudied as a portal of entry for HIV. In cycling women, the endometrium of the upper FRT is extensively remodeled in response to the sex steroids estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone and progestins, synthetic mimics of progesterone, are associated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection in humans and in non-human primate models. Therefore, understanding how these compounds affect the endometrium may yield insights into how HIV establishes infection through this tissue. In our preliminary studies, progesterone decreased barrier function of endometrial epithelial cells, which can facilitate entry of HIV from the luminal cavity into the stromal compartment of the endometrium. Within the stroma resides a dense population of endometrial stromal fibroblasts. Although these cells were not permissive to HIV infection, in co-culture with CD4+ T cells they increased infection by up to 81- fold. In contrast, when progesterone was absent, epithelial barrier integrity was maintained, and the intact layer of endometrial epithelial cells restricted infection by eliciting an antiviral state in co-cultured CD4+ T cells. Using an ex vivo system reconstituted from cells from endometrial biopsies, we will examine the molecular mechanisms responsible for progesterone-induced leakiness (Specific Aim 1), the increased susceptibility to infection mediated by stromal fibroblasts (Specific Aim 2), and epithelia-induced viral restriction (Specific Aim 3) in the upper FRT. Because progesterone-induced epithelial permeability may also occur in the lower FRT, we will additionally test this model using cells isolated from ectocervical biopsies. The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of HIV transmission and restriction in the FRT and provide a robust ex vivo model system to examine the complex interplay between sex steroids and tissue-resident cells in the context of HIV susceptibility. This system and the phenotyping tools we have established can also be adapted to study HIV transmission and restriction in other mucosal portals of entry such the intestinal mucosa and the male foreskin."
"9028287","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will leverage increasingly available technologies to impart a Universal Medication Schedule (UMS) in primary care to help patients living with diabetes safely use and adhere to complex drug regimens. Our research team previously introduced the concept of the UMS to standardize and simplify medication instructions to support safe and effective prescription (Rx) drug use. The UMS standardizes the prescribing and dispensing of medicine by using health literacy principles and more explicit times to describe when to take medicine (morning, noon, evening, bedtime). This eliminates variability found in the way prescriptions are written by physicians and transcribed by pharmacists onto drug bottle labels. We recently tested the UMS in a clinical trial at the point of dispensing medication in pharmacy practice among adults with diabetes. Significant improvement was achieved in proper regimen use and adherence; those who were taking ? 5 Rx drugs and/or were lower literate received the greatest benefit. Yet pharmacy was not the ideal point of implementation, as we learned many patients use multiple pharmacies for cost or convenience, resulting in continued receipt of variable Rx information. Further, findings indicate patients 1) may benefit from direct guidance from their doctor on how to safely consolidate Rx regimens to the most efficient daily schedule, and 2) need basic reminders to support memory. In the proposed study, we will impart the UMS at the point of prescribing in primary care using electronic health records (EHRs). As its foundation, our new intervention will standardize prescribing within an EHR so all medication orders include UMS Rx instructions ('sigs') and patients receive both a medication information sheet and UMS-structured medication list with after-visit summaries. We have already successfully developed and pilot tested these tools (in English and Spanish) within the Epic EHR system. In addition, mobile tools may further improve regimen use. We will link a unidirectional short message service (SMS) text reminder service to the EHR, delivering medication reminders to patients around UMS intervals. We propose to conduct a 3-arm, physician-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the UMS EHR-based strategy, with and without SMS text reminders, to improve patient understanding, safe use and adherence compared to usual care. 1200 (n=400 per arm) English and Spanish-speaking primary care patients living with type 2 diabetes and taking ? 5 Rx drugs will be enrolled from primary care practices in Chicago, IL and New York, NY, with outcomes assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months. We will also determine the fidelity and costs of the interventions to guide future dissemination efforts. Our specific aims are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of the UMS and UMS + SMS text reminder strategies compared to usual care; 2) Determine if the effects of these UMS strategies vary by patients' literacy skills and language; 3)  Evaluate the fidelity of the two strategies and explore patient, staff, physician, and health syste factors influencing the interventions; and 4) Assess the costs required to deliver either intervention from a health system perspective."
"9206962","Abstract  Despite the substantial declines in HIV transmission and increases in lifespan among those living with HIV achieved over the past decade, full benefits that should be possible based on the tools and interventions currently available have yet to be realized in youth, in large part because efficacious interventions for this age group have not been brought to scale. To be effective, youth must be fully engaged in interventions at every stage of the HIV care (treatment and prevention) cascades: HIV testing, linkage to care, timely initiation of care, persistence and adherence to antiretroviral care. At-risk HIV-negative youth need to be consistently engaged in prevention strategies such as PEP and/or PrEP as indicated, consistent safer sex practices and repeat HIV testing. Our U19 project - Scale It Up - specifically focuses on the process of improving self- management among youth including: 1) the identification of interventions that are efficacious and effective for improving self-management in YLH and at risk youth; 2) the multi-site implementation of an intervention shown to be efficacious in improving self-management; and 3) the assessment of the Five Components of Self- Management Model and how these vary over time, are directly improved by interventions, and mediate intervention effects. Our team has also been at the leading edge of implementation Science research related to HIV prevention and care. We are actively committed to aggressively moving beyond simple efficacy and effectiveness RCTs. The four Research Projects proposed in Scale It Up, all addressing self-management, will continue to develop the field of Implementation Science by employing three types of effectiveness- implementation hybrid designs. The studies further synergize by utilizing Aaron?s Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) model to guide the proposed Implementation Science efforts. Our proposed Implementation Science Core, coupled with the cost effectiveness expertise of our Analytic Core, will be focused on the central notion of ?Scale It Up? ? taking efficacious self-management interventions and expeditiously moving them into practice while sustaining effectiveness. Scale It Up has assembled research teams who will develop, test, and bring to practice self-management interventions that positively impact the youth HIV prevention and care cascades. We will achieve these goals by: 1) Designing, conducting and evaluating self-management interventions grounded in the 5-component Self-Management Model and expeditiously moving effective programs into practice; 2) Developing, deploying and disseminating new methods for implementation and implementation analysis with a strong theoretical foundation; and 3) Engaging with the other funded U19s to identify additional opportunities to advance the implementation science and self- management science."

It will focus on the 13-34 year age group. It will also assess how such interventions affect road safety behaviors, as well as other driver characteristics / risk factors for traffic crashes and morbidity and mortality due to such crashes. These are also significant from quality of life and individual and societal costs perspectives.    The research will build upon successful initiatives and practices documented. Sound statistical analysis and epidemiological study methods will be used for experiment design, analyses of data, and interpretation of results. Sample stratification and sample size will be determined to support statistically significant inferences. Before-and-after studies and control group based studies will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. The research questions will be addressed through examinations of both stated behaviors and revealed behaviors pertaining to seatbelt usage and related motor vehicle safety activities and their outcomes. It will leverage existing programs and activities, and develop innovative strategies to maximize the effectiveness of investments in nighttime enforcement activities and related O&E activities. Key stakeholders, collaborators, and partners include state and local law enforcement agencies, departments of transportation, the food and beverage industry, local high schools, colleges, and universities, organized clubs and Greek communities, and religious groups.  The outcomes will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative measures related to stated and observed behaviors.  They will address the impacts of the enforcement and O&E strategies on daytime  and nighttime seatbelt use, motor vehicle morbidity and mortality; effectiveness of individual and  combined intervention elements & O&E strategies; citations issued for other motor vehicle operations  related infractions and violations that are potential road safety indicators such as driving when  impaired, penetration and recognition among the target population of O&E strategies, perceptions of  the effectiveness of O&E strategies, cost effectiveness of enforcement and O&E strategies. These will advance the state-of the knowledge and the state-of-the-practice in our understanding of how to effect behavioral changes to enhance road safety. It will inform future campaigns and guide investments across various settings at the regional and national scales so reduce preventable injuries and fatalities and their outcomes on individual and societal health and well-being."
"9005031","Project Summary/Abstract  Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare genetic skin disorder that causes extreme skin fragility leading to recurrent blister formations or erosions in response to little or no apparent trauma. People born with this disease have defective or lack the anchoring filaments that facilitate the adhesion of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin to the inner dermal layers of the skin. Any skin trauma that creates friction between the skin layers results in painful blister formation and open wounds. Mild form of the disease may be limited to the hands and feet and the severe forms can affect generalized areas of the skin resulting in deformities and disability. The condition is also associated with significant pain and pruritus in most patients. More severe forms of EB are often lethal during childhood, typically because of overwhelming infection. Those who survive into adulthood are at high risk of developing squamous cell carcinomas, which can prove fatal. There are three main types of inherited EB (Simplex, Dystrophic, and Junctional) and, based on the type, the symptoms can range from mild to disabling or life threatening. EB is estimated to affect 20,000 to 50,000 people in the United States, mostly children and is acknowledged as an orphan disease by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . There is currently no cure or effective treatment; care is supportive and palliative. Better treatments producing clinically significant benefits are desperately needed for this serious disease.  Scioderm, INC. is developing SD-101 (proprietary cream formulation containing various concentrations of allantoin) for EB. Scioderm has an open Investigational New Drug Application (IND 107,480) for SD-101 dermal cream (containing allantoin at 3% (SD-101-3.0), 6% (SD-101-6.0), and 9% (SD-101-9.0)). In this grant application, Scioderm is proposing to conduct a confirmatory multi-center, randomized, double-blind, and vehicle controlled Phase 3 study to assess the effectiveness, safety and clinical utility of SD-101-6.0 cream in subjects with EB. The proposed indication is closure of chronic wounds associated with patients with EB. SD- 101 will also be indicated for reduction of skin blistering and erosions associated with EB, by facilitating healing of skin lesions and reducing the incidence and/ or severity of new lesions.  We expect SD-101 to be clinically safe and effective based on results obtained from three clinical studies: (1) a compassionate use study involving 44 EB patients using SD-101-1.5 (containing 1.5% allantoin), (2) an open-label FDA approved study in 8 pediatric EB patients using SD-101-3.0, and (3) a Phase 2B, multi- center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle controlled dose-selection study (SD-003) in 48 EB patients using either SD-101-6.0, SD-101-3.0, or SD-101-0.0 (placebo). The compassionate use study showed a reduction in coverage of blisters and lesions. In the open-label Phase 2 study with SD-101-3.0, complete closure of chronic target lesions was seen in the majority of patients within the first month (88%). SD-101-3.0 was also shown to significantly reduce body surface area (BSA) coverage of blisters and lesions across all EB subtypes. SD-101- 3.0 usage was also shown to have the potential to improve both pain and pruritus. In the Phase 2B study, SD- 101-6.0 was determined be the most efficacious dose in terms of complete closure of chronic target lesions EB patients. Lastly, a recently completed Phase 1 double blinded, parallel, vehicle-controlled study local tolerance study with SD-101-3.0, SD-101-6.0, and SD-101-9.0 revealed that the cream is well tolerated at all doses.  For effective topical, locally delivered pharmaceutical products, both the active ingredient and the formulation are equally important. Scioderm has developed an innovative proprietary formulation containing allantoin which overcomes the low solubility of allantoin at neutral pH and its intrinsic instability. This formulation allows the emulsification and stability of allantoin at concentrations up to 9%, whereas allantoin is usually pharmaceutically unstable at concentrations above 0.5%. In addition, a suitable formulation was developed that allows allantoin to be delivered across various skin barriers in a dose related manner, without systemic absorption. Allantoin in SD-101 has demonstrated stability for over three years at room temperature, whereas in the absence of this stabilization, a viable shelf-life of less than a few months is achievable. Allantoin has been designated as an orphan product (designation 01-1510). SD-101 has also received breakthrough therapy (BT) designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with inherited EB, which may enable expedited development and approval of SD-101 for EB patients. In addition, the Dermatology division of FDA has agreed to waive the majority of the long-term toxicology studies, including carcinogenicity and reproductive studies. All non-clinical studies have been completed to support registration. Agreement with the division was also reached regarding the study design for the pivotal program, including the definition of the primary endpoint. Lastly, the size of the safety database needed to support registration has also been agreed with the Division.  This grant will be used to assist in the completion of the pivotal clinical program necessary for registration and approval of SD-101 for the treatment of skin effects across the various types of EB."
"9215964","Waterborne pathogens like Vibrio cholerae pose significant threats to global health. V. cholerae can persist in the aquatic environment, and it can emerge to cause devastating cholera outbreaks in endemic regions and in vulnerable areas where infrastructure has been compromised and populations have been displaced. The host- pathogen interactions that dictate disease outcome and cholera transmission dynamics occur in the context of a complex microbial ecosystem that includes predatory bacterial viruses (phages). Knowledge of the molecular consequences of phage predation on the selection of epidemic strains is needed to enhance our understanding of the forces impacting the evolution and epidemiology of V. cholerae. We found that a novel group of mobile genetic elements called PLEs (phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements) are a key weapon that epidemic V. cholerae uses to protect against phage attack. Our hypothesis is that PLEs are potent, highly specific, antiviral barriers that act through two distinct mechanisms to ensure that phage do not propagate and spread to neighboring V. cholerae cells. Our data indicate that PLEs act by inhibiting the production of essential phage proteins and by rupturing the infected bacterial cell before all progeny phage complete their replication cycle. To understand PLE activity in mechanistic detail we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) We will define the regulatory network that permits the rapid stimulation of PLE activity when V. cholerae is under attack by phage and determine how specificity is imparted onto PLE-phage interactions. 2) We will determine how PLE interferes with the ability of phage to produce essential proteins. Under this aim we will use a combination of functional genomic approaches and mutational analyses to separate this aspect of PLE activity from PLE-mediated cell lysis. 3) We will determine the molecular basis for PLE-mediated bacterial cell lysis. We will characterize suppressors that are insensitive to cytotoxic PLE-encoded products to understand how PLE efficiently kills phage-infected V. cholerae. The proposed studies will establish how phage predation shapes the genome of epidemic V. cholerae. This knowledge will enhance our understanding of phage-mediated perturbations to microbial populations in healthy and diseased states, and further our ability to manipulate these communities for therapeutic or prophylactic benefit."

"9017891","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A high-resolution, low-cost, and easy-to-implement technique for measuring eye movements will be developed. This will accelerate the pace of research on vision by allowing widespread integration of eye movement measurements into increasingly sophisticated studies of visually- guided behavior, including studies in freely moving  mice. Historically, research on sensory processing has focused to a great extent on the visual system. However, as neuroscientists turn increasingly to using mice in their research, they are turning increasingly away from the visual system in favor of other sensory systems. This is limiting the extent to which our understanding of the visual system can reap the benefits of the powerful molecular-genetic tools available in mice for analyzing neural circuits in health and disease. Mice are sometimes misperceived as being not very visual. Although less dependent on vision than some species, mice clearly use vision for a variety of functions, including navigation and evasion of predators. Thus, there is great potential for the molecular-genetic approaches available uniquely in mice to advance our understanding of the fundamental visual processing operations supporting such visually-guided behavior. Nevertheless a technical barrier is limiting studies of vision in mice, namely the difficulty of measuring and controlling ee movements and hence knowing what the input was to the visual system at the level of the retina. This technical barrier will be eliminated by developing a novel technique for measuring eye movements in mice, based on magnetic sensing. A small but powerful neodymium magnet will be used to create a rotating external magnetic field as the eye rotates in its socket. The angle of the magnetic field will then be detected by an external magnetic field sensor. To optimize performance of the system for measuring eye movements in mice, various magnet shapes, magnetic sensors, and geometric configurations of magnet and sensor will be rigorously tested. Performance will be compared against existing methods for measuring eye movements, namely video-oculography and the scleral search coil techniques. The magnetic system will then be assessed in mice that are free to move, and will be used to examine the coordination of eye and head movements during natural behaviors. Importantly, the techniques developed in mice will be readily adaptable to a broad range of species."
"9130886","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical decision support (CDS) tools are designed to help healthcare providers make better decisions. Significant and mounting evidence suggests that CDS, when used effectively, can improve health care quality, safety, and effectiveness (2-7). Indeed, a good part of the promise of the electronic health record (EHR) to improve patient care relative to a paper-based healthcare ecosystem rests upon CDS. When CDS works well, healthcare providers can come to depend on it. However, we have identified a number of instances where CDS interventions malfunctioned and either stopped providing correct alerts or began providing incorrect alerts. In many cases, these malfunctions persisted for a long period of time and in some cases, they led to patient harm.      We propose a novel anomaly-detection-based method for identifying malfunctions in CDS systems so that they can be corrected. Such approaches have been used in other industries to identify deviations from expected behavior, such as credit card fraud or computer network intrusion detection, but never previously applied to the problem of CDS function and failure.     In preliminary work, we have shown that even simple anomaly-detection-based approaches can identify many CDS malfunctions. In the proposed project, we will extend these methods to improve their sensitivity and specificity and validate them at three sites: Brigham and Women's Hospital, The Ohio State University Medical Center and the University of Texas. We will also conduct a qualitative assessment and root cause analyses of CDS malfunctions and develop an open-source modular dashboard and alerting system for tracking them.     Our project has three aims: 1) to inventory CDS failures and issues that have occurred in three medical centers and conduct root cause analyses to identify causes, indicators, and potential solutions, 2) to develop and validate generalizable anomaly detection approaches to identifying CDS failures and 3) to create, implement, and test a useful and generalizable CDS dashboard and alert system for real-time monitoring for CDS anomalies."
"9202863","Project Summary Falls are the leading cause of injuries, hospital visits, nursing home admissions, and reduced quality of life for people with neurological disorders. Although there is consensus that impaired mobility is the basis for most falls, it is very di?cult to evaluate these complex abilities outside a laboratory setting. Brief clinical examinations do not accurately re?ect daily, functional mobility in real life environments. Patients at risk of falls would bene?t from a system they can easily use to measure their daily mobility, assess mobility ?uctuations throughout the day, evaluate their risk of falling, and measure e?ects of interventions aimed at improving their functional mobility and reducing their falls. No commercial technology yet exists to continuously monitor ?uctuations in mobility or quantify fall risk in natural environments during normal activities. We developed and validated an unobtrusive system, called Mobility Life, to objectively characterize gait and turning during spontaneous activities with wearable inertial sensors. During this Phase II, we will develop an instrumented ankle wrap for continuous monitoring of gait, develop a user interface to support clinical research, develop reports that show indications of fall risk for clinical practice, and thoroughly verify and validate our technology. We will also determine which metrics are most indicative of fall risk and determine normative values for non-fallers in the same age range as the expected patient populations. Our speci?c aims are: AIM I. Technology Development: Prepare Mobility Life for clinical practice.  · Milestone 1: Develop an instrumented elastic ankle bandage (SmartSox) for continuous gait monitoring.  · Milestone 2: Develop useful clinical reports to convey patients' daily mobility impairments, ?uctuations, and  fall risk.  · Milestone 3: Complete the system veri?cation and validation in preparation for FDA 510(k) clearance to market. Aim II. Clinical Research: Demonstrate the clinical utility of Mobility Life to monitor quality of functional mobility and fall risk in neurological patients.  · Milestone 4: Determine which daily life mobility impairments best predict fall risk in patients with PD or MS.  · Milestone 5: Develop reference values for integrity of functional mobility in healthy age-matched subjects."
"9144347","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Antipsychotic (AP) use in the care of nursing home residents with dementia poses major patient safety challenges for residents, families, facilities, prescribers, regulators, and other stakeholders. Implementing alternative management strategies for the often-distressing behavioral and psychological manifestations of dementia is complex and often difficult. APs continue to be widely used in nursing homes, despite strong evidence of increased mortality and a resulting FDA black box warning. In 2012, long-term care stakeholders and policymakers including CMS, industry, and state leaders initiated the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care in Nursing Homes and companion state partnerships, with an initial goal for 2012 of a 15% reduction in AP use by long-stay residents. Some states achieved 20-25% reductions while others saw little change. State use rates currently range from 12% to 27%, with wide variation across facilities. It is essential to examine the comparative impact of the varied state strategies for safer dementia management, including co- occurring changes in other dimensions of dementia management and potential unintended consequences (such as substitution of sedative/hypnotics). A clearer understanding of the factors associated with variations in initiation and subsequent management of treatments is much needed. Current quality measures focus on facility-reported prevalence of AP use, while safety risks also vary substantially by dosage, duration, polypharmacy, and other specific characteristics of treatment. There is a critical need for more specific and informative measurement of these practices, to more clearly define the underlying safety challenge; inform development of improved quality measures; and identify modifiable points of intervention. Integration of multiple quantitative and qualitative data sources has great potential to address these crucial questions. We will therefore conduct a stakeholder-engaged, multi-method study that integrates analysis of merged administrative data on the full national long-stay population with case-study and translational components. Analyses of linked Minimum Data Set, Medicare claims, facility/regulatory, and other data sources will provide a comprehensive analysis of current patterns, variations, and predictors of safety-related dimensions of AP use in NHs. We will examine resident, facility, and policy factors associated with use, and analyze national and state-level changes in use patterns following the quality improvement initiatives. Complementary state and facility case studies will identify and analyze impact of key components of successful state interventions; identify and document factors associated with sustained impact; and identify strategies successfully utilized at the facility level for sustainable improvement in dementia care safety. In an active translational component, we will partner with the national Advancing Excellence campaign to translate project-generated knowledge and products into effective, systemic use. Results will provide actionable knowledge to strengthen national and state initiatives to increase use of safer, person-centered dementia care practices."
"9146113","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) that affect HIV infected individuals continue to increase. The prevalence of HAND and the incomplete reversal of neurocognitive dysfunctions after antiretroviral therapy have called for novel therapeutic approaches. Among the various pathophysiology of HAND, synaptic dysfunction likely underlies cognitive impairments. Interestingly, Tat, an essential HIV-1 viral protein, is present in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals virologically controlled on cART. Furthermore, Brain-specific HIV protein Tat expression in mice mimics key aspects of HAND pathology in the post-cART era, suggesting that Tat may be responsible for the sustained central nervous system complications in patients receiving cART. Tat is known to cause neuronal injury via excitotoxic mechanisms. Furthermore, HIV-1-infected patients have significantly higher concentrations of glutamate in their plasma and cerebrospinal fluid compared to uninfected controls. Elevated levels of glutamate disrupt normal neural transmission in the brain, contributing to the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. In the past decade we have established that blocking the activity of glutaminase (GLS), a primary enzyme for the production of glutamate, could alleviate macrophages and microglia neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic response. We have demonstrated causal effects of innate immune activation and proinflammatory on the GLS function in macrophages, microglia, and neurons. Furthermore, we have observed an intriguing release of GLS by macrophages, microglia, and neurons, through unidentified mechanism(s) that could cause neuronal injury. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which include microvesicles and exosomes, have emerged as an important cellular mechanism for GLS release. Therefore, in the current proposal, we hypothesize that the release of GLS-containing EVs is a critical pathogenic event in HIV-1-mediated neuronal injury and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, we hypothesize that blocking aberrantly upregulated/released GLS through GLS inhibitors could have therapeutic effects in HAND. Information will be provided as whether brain-specific overexpression of GLS is sufficient to induce brain inflammation, impair synaptic integrity and cognition in mice, and whether macrophage-specific conditional knockout of GLS gene and blocking of GLS-containing microvesicles release could protect neuronal function in a Tat transgenic mouse model of HAND. Furthermore, novel water-soluble GLS inhibitors will be evaluated for their therapeutic potentials in HAND relevant animal models. The elucidation of the GLS dysregulation and its contribution to pathophysiology of HAND will aid in developing potential novel agents for the treatment of HAND and other neurodegenerative disorders."
"9255554","By the time an individual is diagnosed with Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) or dementia, they have often already experienced both gradual and dramatic changes to their health, cognitive function, employment and financial status, among other life events. A number of key interview-based studies like The National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) have provided us with tremendous insight into the transitions that occur as individuals experience the early stages of AD or dementia, but we have less information about these changes at the most granular levels of daily life and this lack of data limits both our search for preventative strategies and our understanding of social and environmental factors which can mitigate the severity of the disease. We propose to develop an easy to use, quickly configurable smartphone-based application for data gathering, which would drop the cost of high granularity measurements by three orders of magnitude ? making it possible for scholars of AD, and ageing more generally, to gather new kinds of high-granularity measurements about how every aspect of health, finance, time and family interact in caregiving. Our proposed smartphone based data collection platform has data types that will be highly overlapping with existing studies of the elderly, including HRS and NHATS, and once validated, this tool could be employed broadly in scientific research, dramatically lowering the cost of doing research with elders thus dramatically increasing the ability of researchers to engage protective and mitigating events at high fidelity. We estimate that the validated platform could be deployed at an annual cost of less than $750/subject and would yield up to 1M data points per subject per year for the AD research community."
"9244895","PROJECT SUMMARY A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of neurologic dysfunction. The conventional viewpoint is that there are no residual motor deficits following a TIA. However, recent evidence suggests that individuals who have a TIA have impairments in activities of daily living and driving. These activities require robust motor control. Our preliminary data suggest that compared with healthy adults, individuals with TIA exhibit greater movement variability during isolated ankle dorsiflexion, greater stride length variability during over ground walking, greater lane maintenance variability during a simulated road driving task, and greater brake force variability during a reactive driving task. In addition, individuals with a TIA exhibit greater variability of the neural activation and greater co-activation of the agonist and antagonist muscles. Based on these findings, we test the central hypothesis that TIA impairs motor control, over ground walking, driving, and the neural activation of muscle. To address this hypothesis we propose the following two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether individuals who had a TIA exhibit deficits in motor control compared with healthy age-matched controls. To accomplish this aim, we will recruit 30 individuals 1-5 weeks post TIA and 30 age matched controls. We will quantify deficits in motor control during isolated ankle dorsiflexion, over ground walking, simulated road driving, and reactive driving. We hypothesize that individuals with a TIA will exhibit greater motor output variability during the isolated ankle dorsiflexion tasks, greater walking variability, and deficits in road driving and reactive driving performance. In Aim 2, we will determine whether individuals who had a TIA exhibit altered neural activation of muscle compared with healthy age-matched controls. To accomplish this aim, we will test the same individuals as in Aim 1. We will examine single- and multi-motor unit discharge rate and agonist and antagonist muscle activity. We hypothesize that individuals with TIA will exhibit greater single- and multi-motor unit discharge rate variability, greater agonist and antagonist muscle variability, and greater coactivation for the agonist and antagonist muscles than healthy controls. This proposal will be the first to identify whether individuals who had a TIA exhibit residual functional motor control deficits. It is essential because the incidence of TIA is expected to increase dramatically leading to increased number of falls and driving accidents, and contribute significantly to health-related expenses."
"9259816","Project summary/abstract The 2017 LGBTQ Health Conference will bring together leading researchers and practitioners, trainees and students to bridge research and practice with the aim of addressing health disparities for LGBTQ populations. This proposal requests funding for a 3-day conference in Chicago, the 5th annual LGBTQ Health Conference, organized by a long-term successful academic-community partnership between the Northwestern IMPACT LGBT Health and Development Program (now the Northwestern Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing) and Center on Halsted, the most comprehensive LGBTQ community center in the Midwest. The conference aims to improve both research and practice on LGBTQ health by convening leading practitioners and researchers to present and discuss cutting-edge translational findings in the field; to train the next generation of practitioners and researchers in LGBTQ health; and to disseminate the findings to a broad group of audiences that includes the general public, policymakers, LGBTQ communities nationwide in addition to academics, clinicians and service providers. A major goal of the conference is to increase participation by traditionally underrepresented groups in science, including women and transgender people, racial/ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, not only as audience members but as organizers, presenters, keynote speakers and moderators. In the past, our LGBTQ Health Conferences have stimulated new research and collaborations, trained clinicians and service providers, and created opportunities for trainees, students, and junior investigators to learn and connect with leaders in the field. We plan to build on our past accomplishments to expand the 2017 Conference from one to three days, thus increasing the number of lectures, panel sessions, networking opportunities, poster presentations and by expanding our successful Professional Development Institute. The overall goal of this Conference is to catalyze research to reduce and eventually eliminate health disparities among LGBTQ people. These disparities are severe and affect LGBTQ people's life expectancy, mental and physical health, access to and quality of care, and overall quality of life. Critical disparities are found in risk and incidence of mental health issues including suicide, substance abuse, HIV and other STIs and are linked to minority status, stigma, discrimination, and denial of human and civil rights. As is the case among other minorities experiencing disparities, these disparities are not born equally among all LGBTQ people: transgender people, LGBTQ people of color and low-income people bear a disproportionate burden of these disparities. The proposed 2017 LGBTQ Health Conference will be a unique opportunity to gather the best knowledge and practice in the field through an intersectional lens to improve the lives of all LGBTQ people."
"9244977","Ethanol use is a common occurrence worldwide, and the onset of ethanol exposure is a major contributing factor to ethanol abuse. Adolescence is a developmental period when ethanol use is typically initiated, making it a highly vulnerable time to predispose future abuse and alterations in neurobehavioral function. Moreover, adolescents consume more ethanol per drinking session than adults, perhaps due to the greater sensitivity to the anxiolytic properties of ethanol during this highly stressful and anxiety-provoking developmental stage. However, the neurobiological mechanisms of acute ethanol in adolescents are poorly understood. The opioid system is a major target of ethanol and kappa opioid receptors (KORs), particularly, have been shown to play a major role in the neurophysiological effects of ethanol in the reward and anxiety circuits. The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a key structure of the reward and anxiety circuits, is involved in ethanol-seeking behaviors. Specifically, alterations in GABA transmission within the BLA are associated with the anxiolytic properties of ethanol and ethanol-seeking. Importantly, KOR activation modulates BLA excitability and anxiety-like behaviors in an age-dependent manner, suggesting that KORs may significantly contribute to the increased sensitivity to the anxiolytic properties of ethanol in adolescents, which may drive increased ethanol consumption in adolescence. Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to test the interactions between BLA KORs and ethanol consumption in adolescents. Importantly, preliminary findings indicate that a KOR agonist potentiates GABAergic transmission within the BLA of adolescents, but not adults, and this effect is similar to that of acute ethanol. This suggests that ethanol may hijack the KOR system, thereby resulting in anxiolysis, which helps promote ethanol consumption in adolescents. Two Specific Aims will (1) determine the functional interactions between BLA KOR activation and acute ethanol in vitro and (2) examine the interaction of BLA KORs and acute ethanol on anxiety-like behavior and ethanol consumption. These innovative studies will test novel and unique hypotheses surrounding the developmental differences of ethanol and describe neural mechanisms specific to adolescent ethanol exposure."
"9127149","The key objective of this project involves the exploration of US rare and endangered plants and their unique host-microbiome community. These communities will be studied for their biosynthesis and production of new classes of natural products (NPs) HCV drug leads with unique MOAs. The project involves a well established collaborative relationship with the laboratories of Prof Mark Hamann and at the University of Mississippi and Tony Whitaker with RFS Pharma and Raymond Schinazi at Emory University/Atlanta VA.  The collective expertise provides a unique opportunity to explore new sources for treatments for HCV which are resistant to current forms of treatment.  The specific aims of this program include:   1. A collection and phylogenetic analysis of 100 endangered plant associated bacteria and fungi strains each year.  Phylogenetically diverse and unique US endangered plant species (20) will be evaluated for bacteria and fungi which inhibit HCV.  This will provide 500 unique bacteria and fungi over the course of the five year project period.  2. Innovative epigenetic tools will be applied to stimulate production of secondary metabolites from silent genes.  These will include regulatory tools available commercially as well as those derived from the host endangered plant itself.  Each new strain will be subjected to 10 or more epigenetic tools.  Highly sensitive HPLC with UV-TOF-ELS detection and small volume NMR will be utilized to evaluate NP production from genes silent under standard culture conditions. 3. A unique HCV real time PCR assay is featured in this grant application as a primary screen to identify extracts obtained from Aim 2 with HCV selectivity for fractionation in aim 4. 4. Active leads from Aim 3 will be purified using HPLC with MS, UV and ELSD detection.  Repeated bioassays using real time PCR will be completed until HCV selective metabolites are generated.  Natural product structures will be assigned using integrated NMR, HPLC-MS, UV, IR and X-ray crystallographic analysis."
"9253697","PROJECT SUMMARY Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder associated with the development of nervous system tumors including vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, cranial nerve tumors, and spinal tumors due to germline loss of one copy of the NF2 gene. While the prevalence of NF2 syndrome is only 1:33,000, NF2 is commonly lost sporadically, and up to 1:300 people will develop a tumor with an underlying NF2 mutation; therefore, developing therapies that target NF2 mutant tumors is critical for NF2 patients and the general population. The current standard of care for NF2 patients is surgical resection of the tumors, although surgery is often not feasible and there is a high risk of hearing loss, facial weakness, and dysphagia. Radiation therapy has been utilized in NF2, but can be associated with chronic neurologic dysfunction and/or malignant transformation. The goal of this proposal is to establish a swine model of NF2 that recapitulates the disease seen in NF2 patients to better understand disease etiology and progression and provide a reliable preclinical model for establishing safety and efficacy of new therapies prior to clinical trials. A common human NF2 disease allele will be engineered into the genome of swine fibroblasts using site-specific nucleases, and those fibroblasts will undergo somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate pigs that harbor the human mutant NF2 allele. At 6 months of age these NF2 pigs will be evaluated by MRI for the presence of brain tumors and by brain auditory evoked response and compared to control animals to determine if they have NF2-related hearing deficits, often seen in NF2 patients. This model would allow the field to overcome two major hurdles in NF2 research. First, the mouse models of NF2 and NF2- related tumors do not fully recapitulate the disease seen in NF2 patients and have been poor predictors of clinical efficacy. Second, due to a small patient population and orphan disease status, the ability to recruit enough patients for clinical trials is nearly impossible. A large animal model that could serve as a preclinical platform for drug safety, toxicology and efficacy would dramatically progress the development of NF2 therapeutics and candidate drug prioritization for a patient population that is too small to recruit enough patients for many clinical trials. Further, the NF2 mutation that was engineered in our swine model is a premature termination codon in exon 2 of the NF2 gene, allowing our model to serve as a platform for testing premature termination codon suppression therapies which are applicable to NF2, but also in the one-third of genetic disorders characterized by premature termination codons including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
"9164618","Project Summary This K99/R00 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a research program designing individualized interventions to slow cognitive decline in persons with neurodegenerative disease that are based on underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Candidate: My clinical experience as a nurse practitioner and research experience in cognitive neuroscience ideally position me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biologic basis of neurodegenerative conditions such as Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD). I had strong neuroscience training at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was supported by an NRSA Predoctoral Award to investigate the neural basis of apathy in behavioral variant Frontotemporal Degeneration (bvFTD). I was subsequently awarded an Individual NRSA Postdoctoral Fellowship to investigate how lifestyle factors contribute to longitudinal worsening in apathy. In this research, I have gained experience with longitudinal design and learned about additional MRI measures such as diffusion tensor imaging of white matter tracts. I have become increasingly interested in longitudinal cognitive decline and how lifestyle and biologic factors contribute to the variable rate of decline in bvFTD. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in the biological basis for symptom progression in neurodegenerative disease in order to design interventions for bvFTD. I will pursue training in intervention design and methods to prepare for a subsequent R01 where I will use the knowledge gained from this K99/R00 to design and test cognitive interventions that boost neural compensation to slow decline in bvFTD. Environment: This award will be conducted at The Pennsylvania State University (PSU), College of Nursing and the University of Pennsylvania, Frontotemporal Degeneration Center (UPenn FTDC). PSU and UPenn are leading centers for the study of neurodegenerative disease and I have strong institutional support from both universities. PSU is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for aging research and methodology including, non-pharmacological intervention research for individuals with neurodegenerative disease. My mentor, Dr. Donna Fick, is a nurse researcher with expertise in cognitive decline and she has a productive research program developing tailored interventions for persons with delirium and dementia based on cognitive reserve theory. Given my future goal of developing cognitive interventions, PSU is the ideal environment to pursue training in intervention methods. The UPenn FTDC is a leading center for biologic research in neurodegenerative disease including expert centers for genetic and neuroimaging research and relevant clinical research laboratories. The UPenn FTDC maintains one of the largest neurodegenerative disease datasets that includes a diverse range of modalities such as MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeling, genetics, cerebrospinal and neuropsychological testing. My co-mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, is the Director of the UPenn FTDC and thus will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to this unique dataset as well as laboratory resources and collaborations with other neuroimaging and genetic experts at UPenn. Training: I will develop my expertise in the cognitive and neural basis of longitudinal decline in neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Donna Fick, and my co-mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman. Specifically, I will engage in training related to longitudinal statistical methods, genetics, advanced neuroimaging skills and intervention design and methods. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with my mentorship team. Research: bvFTD is a common cause of young-onset neurodegenerative disease and life expectancy is approximately 7 years, but this is highly variable. Recent studies have demonstrated the moderating effects of lifestyle and genetic factors on the clinical course of bvFTD. Neuroanatomic factors may also play a role in neural implementation of compensatory function, such as supporting alternate brain networks for optimal performance. The overall research aim of this proposal is to better understand the moderating effects of lifestyle and biologic factors on longitudinal decline in young-onset dementia, and an account of the mechanisms by which this occurs. This knowledge is crucial for the design of cognitive interventions that take advantage of compensatory mechanisms to enhance cognitive function and slow decline in neurodegenerative disease.  "

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Platform for Large-scale Discovery in Common Disease: Project Summary A comprehensive understanding of the genome architecture variants underlying inherited human disease phenotypes and protective alleles will facilitate improved diagnosis, prognosis, disease management, and the development of new treatments for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In support of this goal, we propose to apply our established, state-of-the-art DNA sequencing and analysis platform to comprehensively identify rare variation influencing susceptibility to common complex diseases corresponding to three disease themes: 1) cardiovascular disease and metabolic risk, 2) autoimmune disease including Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and 3) developmental and degenerative diseases including cleft lip/palate, idiopathic scoliosis and macular degeneration. Where possible, we will leverage emerging methods and technology to advance the state of the field and achieve our program goals. Our approach extends the discovery power of low-cost whole genome sequencing (WGS) with innovative laboratory and computational techniques to comprehensively interrogate the full spectrum of human genome variation. We developed these studies with substantial input from expert collaborators whose continued involvement and disease-specific expertise will be critical for success. Ultimately, the diversity of our proposed projects - in ters of disease phenotypes, sample ancestries, and study designs - will provide a better understanding of the genetic architecture of common disease and the extent to which it is shared across world populations."
"9245279","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is a lack of evidence-based SUD treatment and services targeting returning inmates. Substance Use Programming for Person-Oriented Recovery (SUPPORT) is a community-driven, recovery-oriented approach to substance abuse care which has the potential to address this service gap. SUPPORT is modeled after Indiana?s Access to Recovery (ATR) program, which was closed due to lack of federal support despite positive improvements in clients? recovery outcomes. SUPPORT builds on the limitations of ATR in that it will: focus specifically on a prison reentry population; be community-driven, rather than state administered; require direct service staff be certified peer recovery coaches; provide clients a full year of services instead of 6-months; and utilize an electronic data capture system, rather than paper surveys, to improve data-driven decision making. The ultimate goal of this project is the establishment of SUPPORT as an effective and scalable recovery- oriented system of care. A necessary step we must take before launching a large clinical trial is the development and pilot testing of the SUPPORT intervention. This study has three aims corresponding to this initial task. Aim 1 is to develop SUPPORT. We will utilize qualitative data collected from past Indiana ATR clients and providers and learning meetings with advisors to determine how to best develop and revise formal policies, procedures, and fidelity guidelines for the intervention. Aim 2 is to conduct a pilot test to assess feasibility for an R01 study. We will conduct a pilot test at a Central Indiana agency that provides services to returning inmates, using random assignment to compare SUPPORT clients to clients receiving usual treatment. We will collect quantitative data for both groups at multiple points and also collect qualitative data from SUPPORT clients to better understand their program experiences. Aim 3 is the identification of implementation barriers to inform future dissemination activities. We will conduct semi-structured phone interviews with potential adopters of the model to improve SUPPORT?s transferability by identifying possible barriers and facilitators to replicability beyond Indiana. To accomplish these aims, the study?s developmental evaluation framework uses continuous data collection and rapid response. The resulting study will investigate the effectiveness of SUPPORT for improving client recovery outcomes to a similar SUD program that is missing key elements of the model. This project will increase scientific knowledge related to recovery-oriented services, an area of research that is currently lacking. The development of such a model will also be of interests to a variety of stakeholder groups given the current focus on recovery-oriented care in policy and treatment."
"9275269","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Summary (public abstract) Health care providers, insurance companies, and even politicians are encouraging individuals and populations to improve their fitness and health through self-monitoring. The hope is that awareness of one's activity, weight, sleep habits, etc. might motivate a person to be more active, eat better, and sleep more. In short, awareness might lead to a healthier and happier population. Smart activity monitors, some of which are small enough to replace the zipper on a jacket, be worn on the wrist, or clipped to a shoelace, can provide a variety of feedback to the wearer. The devices can display and share a variety of metrics including: steps taken, stairs climbed, distance travelled, activity duration, and battery status. Some have replaceable batteries that can last four to five months; others have batteries that never need replacing but must be recharged every five days or so like a cell phone. The capacity to wirelessly sync to a computer or smart phone enables personalized feedback and peer group sharing. Feedback can include: weekly summary statics by email; daily, weekly, monthly charts with population norms; achievement awards; and participation in contests. Peer group sharing is a particularly interesting feature as it enables the awareness of the activity levels of other invited individuals within a social network. Knowledge of peer group performance through social networks can be a strong motivator. While the health and happiness of many Veteran lower limb amputees might improve from the provision of these devices, it is unknown how many would embrace the technology and make it part of their everyday life. The major cohort of the proposed research is the aging Veteran who lost a lower limb due to either peripheral vascular disease and diabetes or combat-injuries sustained in Vietnam. These Veterans are among the 623,000 Americans who live with lower limb amputation; a population expected to grow to over 1.4 million by the year 2050. Importantly, many older, less-active amputees seek comfort, gain confidence, and maintain social standing by prioritizing relationships through direct, face-to-face contact. This finding suggests many in our cohort may not relate to an abstract level of function (step counts) and that internet-enabled social networks  may be of little interest. However, there is recent evidence to suggest this older cohort are becoming more connected through the internet and now might be the time to challenge this stereotype. The goal of the proposed research is to determine if it is worthwhile to provide Veteran lower limb amputees with smart activity monitors. Our two specific aims are to: (1) Determine if Veteran lower limb amputees are willing to use smart activity monitors as part of their daily life, and (2) Discover if feedback of actual and goal activity levels with or without te use of an internet-based social network (peer group community forum) can elevate activity levels and maintain it over a prolonged period of time. We propose to provide smart activity monitors to a sample population of Veteran, below-knee amputees age 50 or older (n=90), teach them how to upload activity data with or without social network access to a peer group, and observe their participation and activity levels. The results will answer our question if Vetera lower limb amputees are willing to habitually wear smart activity monitors and if feedback from the devices, with and without the influence of an internet-based social network of the participants' peers, can have an influence over duration of the two year study. The proposed research will provide a thorough understanding whether or not an inexpensive device (<$60) can improve the mobility (and health) of Veteran lower limb amputees. If successful, our long-term goal is to pursue a nation-wide implementation of this technology."
"9143731","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this application is to develop the career of Dr. Christian Badr to facilitate the transition to a stable independent phase and attain his ultimate goal to become an independent scientist and establish his own research program. The career development plan created by the candidate will contribute substantially to his scientific development and further his training in proteomics, RNAi and cancer stem cells biology. The proposed opportunity in the K22 will provide the PI protected time while starting his independent Faculty position and direct him towards a successful career in developing therapeutics for brain tumors. The proposed research will also serve as the foundation for an R01 proposal prior to the end of the second year of this award. Glioma stem cells (GSC) represent a subset population within malignant gliomas, and are highly tumorigenic, intrinsically resistant to current therapies, and capable of self-renewal and differentiation into mature glioma cells (GCs). There are two major subtypes of GSCs: Proneural (PN) and Mesenchymal (MES), the latter being more aggressive and more resistant to conventional treatment. We have identified a subpopulation of GSCs, termed floating cells (FC) that could be isolated from in vitro-cultured glioma cells. These cells possess a stem-like signature with prominent mesenchymal features. They tend to be more aggressive when implanted into the brain of nude mice as compared to their parental GSCs line and have a superior resistance to radiation and therapy. Due to such properties, FC represents an ideal model to identify and test new GBM therapeutics. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will use quantitative mass spectrometry to perform a proteomic analysis on different models of PN and MES GSCs including the FC population. This work will provide a deeper characterization of the FCs and identify differentially expressed proteins/pathways in PN and MES GSCs, which could be exploited to develop new therapeutics. In Aim 2, we will use imaging-based reporters and perform an RNAi screen to identify GSCs modulators which either push GSCs to a more differentiated state, making them susceptible to conventional therapy, or simply kill these cells. Finally we will test a novel gene delivery approach based on extracellular vesicles packaged in adeno-associated virus vectors (vAAV) to deliver our therapeutic RNAi to brain tumors in mice. This work can add valuable information for understanding the biology of this elusive tumor population and plasticity between GSCs subtypes. It also has the potential to identify new vulnerabilities and therapeutic avenues for PN and MES gliomas."

"9124930","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a bioinformatics toolbox to process and quantify complex muscle cell images for automated phenotype analysis. The toolbox is aimed to provide both clinical practitioners and laboratory investigators with the much-needed capability to automatically detect and identify pathological features that manifest themselves in many muscle-related diseases such as cardiomyopathy, muscular hypertrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (often known as Lou Gehrig's disease), muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy, and inflammatory muscle damage. Many of these conditions have no effective treatment and high fatality rates. For example, ALS is progressive neurodegenerative disease that is caused by the death of motor neurons and results in increasing muscle weakness and atrophy, has a survival rate less than twenty percent over a five-year period, and the disease affects more 5,000 people in the U.S. each year. In our search for treatment for the muscle-related diseases, lack of computational method to objectively and quantitatively analyze muscle cell images has become a rate limit factor. As clinicians and researchers are increasingly looking into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the diseases, detailed pathological analysis is necessary for people to understand the biological processes. Yet, the only available approach is manual analysis which is confined to small datasets and qualitatively interpretation of the images. Important pathological features may be missed by manual analysis or obscured due to the large variation in human observation. Also results of manual analysis are not immediately ready for data management and analysis because of the long time it takes. Hence we identified the need for a dedicated toolbox to facilitate muscle-related research, which was confirmed by our user community.      Featuring novel imaging processing algorithms, the toolbox will quantitatively analyze muscle cells, integrate results from multiple channels, and export quantitative results, with little user intervention. The toolbox will advance clinical and laboratory research by providing detailed analysis of histopathological features such as the intact of cellular membrane, the location of nuclei, and geometric measurements of the cells. It will facilitate discovery by highlighting subtl yet important information in histopathology, reducing human errors, and enabling research to analyze a larger number of images than they currently are able to. The toolbox will also improve workflow in clinics and laboratories by providing users with high sensitivity, objectivity, and efficiency in interpreting muscle cell images. The quantifying capability of the toolbox will allow users to compare therapeutic treatments with a high confidence level.      Overall the project will benefit the large biomedical community of treating and researching muscle-related diseases. In turn, the project will benefit the patients of muscular diseases by facilitating diagnosis of muscular disorders and discovery of new therapies."
"9050203","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), characterized by hypertrophy and fibrosis of the left ventricle (LV) and septum, is the most common inherited heart disease. The gene MYBPC3 encoding cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC) accounts for approximately 40-50% of cases in which causative mutations are identified. Of special note is the high frequency of nonsense mutations resulting in truncated proteins in MYBPC3 relative to other HCM-linked genes. The most prevalent hypothesis for the primary disease mechanism in these cases is inadequate sarcomeric wild-type cMyBPC expression. However, such haploinsufficiency of cMyBPC has yet to be satisfactorily demonstrated, and the Day lab has published data from a large sampling of human HCM myocardial tissue suggesting this is not the case. Growing evidence, supported by findings of ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction in cell and animal models expressing truncated cMyBPC as well as in human HCM, indicates protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms play an important role. Cardiac PQC is an area of undervalued potential in which further elucidation of the complex pathogenesis of HCM may be made. Chaperone proteins are crucial to proper PQC, but little is known about their effects on myocardial physiology. Experimentally, knockout of inducible Hsp70 and its cochaperone Hspa4 both caused LV hypertrophy in mice. This research training plan will investigate a potential link between UPS dysfunction and interactions of truncated cMyBPC with the Hsp70 family of chaperones. The main hypothesis is that UPS dysfunction and proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes expressing truncated cMyBPC can be alleviated by clearance of the mutant proteins via the protein triaging activity of Hsp70 chaperones. The specific aims of this proposal are to define physical and functional interactions between mutant cMyBPC and the Hsp70 family of chaperones and to determine the effects of promoting cMyBPC degradation by modulating Hsp70 activity or expression on UPS dysfunction and proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes. These aims will be accomplished using a complementary battery of biochemical, cellular, and whole organism assays performed in both established and innovative new cell culture and animal models of HCM."
"9132605","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a common entity with significant quality of life effects. However, the exact prevalence and incidence of IC is unclear a prior attempts to address this used solely administrative claims data or referral patterns from tertiary care referral centers. In order to define the national prevalence and incidence of IC, we propose a study using nation-wide data pulled from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers, the largest integrated health system in the country. The goals of this study are to identify every IC patient within the VA system, to dive deep into the medical records of these patients to confirm the diagnosis of IC using a combination of automated data pulls plus hand-abstraction, to determine what other comorbid conditions co-exist with IC, and to assess treatment patterns and outcomes. By normalizing these data to US nation-wide numbers, we will be able to estimate the US nation-wide incidence and prevalence of IC. We will also prospective enroll a subset of these patients in a cohort study obtaining valuable quality of life data, patient-reporte outcomes, and urine samples. From this, we will be able to better assess the impact of IC on day-to-day life of the patients. Using the urine samples, we will explore whether biomarkers we have already identified to predict IC flare can be used to confirm the diagnosis of IC. Specific Aims are (Aim 1) Identify national-level prevalence and incidence of interstitial cystitis among a socio-economically and racially diverse population; (Aim 2) Prospectively determine the association between interstitial cystitis and health related quality of life and other comorbid conditions through validated questionnaires; and (Aim 3) Explore urine-based biomarkers to diagnose IC. If successful, our project has the possibility, for the first time, of clearly definin national-level prevalence and incidence of IC along with valuable information on treatment patterns and outcomes, impact of IC on quality of life and other co-morbid conditions, and even validate a biomarker for IC diagnosis. In summary, this study, by using an innovative approach to tap into nation-wide data, holds the potential to shed tremendous light on a disease of which to date we know very little."
"9335166","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accidental or intended radiation exposure in a mass casualty setting presents a serious and ongoing threat. While radioprotective agents can be used with some success when given prior to radiation exposure they are of limited use when used post-exposure. The current proposal prepares the groundwork for a post radiation strategy to protect critical tissues affected by ARS within days after the radiation event has occurred. This approach is based on strong preliminary evidence that stromal/stem cell transplantation provides an effective measure to ameliorate radiation injury. Unlike BMT, the critical difference between the two cell transplantation approaches is that endothelial or mesenchymal stem cell transplantation mediates the recovery of damaged host stem cells via accelerated hematopoiesis or intestinal regeneration or wound healing rather than its replacement with donor derived cells. This provides a novel approach to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for radiation mitigation. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to exploit this experimental system to identify the factors and signals elaborated by the stromal cells in the stem cell niche (endothelial, mesenchymal and macrophages) that mediate the regeneration of the irradiated gastrointestinal, hematopoietic or cutaneous system. All four projects of this CMCR are thematically based on this premise and have the following objectives: Define pathophysiologic mechanisms, discovery and validation of molecular targets in ARS , Determine how to accelerate stem cell recovery and regeneration by systemic administration of growth factors in mice, Examine whether repair of the ISC niche by TLR activation and/or stromal cell-based therapies could mitigate ARS in vertebrates (i.e. mice and zebrafish), and Explore the potential of modulators of signal transduction to substitute and amplify signals necessary for stem cell survival and regeneration. Project 1: Stem cell-based therapies for mitigation of radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS). Project 2: Endothelial cell-derived factors for mitigation of bone marrow syndrome. Project 3: Nanoparticle-based therapies for cutaneous radiation syndrome and Project 4: Mitigation of radiation damage by modulating inflammatory signaling pathways."
"9129769","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The capacity for memory is one of the most profound features of the mammalian brain, and the proper encoding and retrieval of information are the processes that form the basis of learning. The centrality of learning and memory to all aspects of mammalian life underscores the devastating nature of degenerative neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia that impair the hippocampus and compromise these processes. Although the hippocampal formation is one of the most extensively studied structures in the brain, the circuit mechanisms underlying its normal function remain elusive. Hippocampal principal cells form complex representations of the external environment, but in stark contrast to the diversity of inhibitory interneurons catalogued and despite the apparent need for functional segregation, they are largely considered a homogeneous population. The goal of this proposed research is to investigate functional segregation within the pyramidal cell population at the output node of the hippocampus, area CA1. In particular, given known developmental, genetic, and connectivity differences between superficial and deep cells in this region, we aim to explore the functional differences between these subpopulations and their relative contributions to learning and memory.  This proposal implements numerous recent advances in optical imaging and genetic perturbation methods in the mouse, allowing us to longitudinally monitor and manipulate the activity of large populations of hippocampal neurons with submicron spatial resolution over days to weeks as the animal engages in various learning paradigms. In area CA1 principal cells form representations of the external world through their coordinated firing patterns. While spatial representations of static environments persist over long time periods, firing patterns in the CA1 principal cell population change dramatically over the course of learning. This proposal will test the hypothesis that superficial and deep CA1 principal cells demonstrate different coding dynamics during spatial navigation behaviors and learning tasks. Preliminary data from a head-fixed spatial navigation task suggests that spatial representations in the superficial CA1 pyramidal cell population are highly stable over many days, while firing patterns in the deep population are far more variable, suggesting a functional difference between these subpopulations and perhaps satisfying the need for both stability and flexibility in hippocampal codes. This proposal will also implement pharmacogenetic manipulations to test the hypothesis that coding differences between these subpopulations are the causal basis for differential contributions to learning and memory. In summary this work will use chronic head-fixed two- photon imaging of different subpopulations of CA1 pyramidal cells during learning in the awake rodent to further our understanding of functional subdivision in the hippocampal circuit."
"9205966","Project Summary  The goal of our R21 project is to develop a powerful platform that will be able to generate and assay millions of combinations of CRISPR/Cas9 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) or other genetic perturbagens. Doing so will clear the way for systematic exploration of genetic interactions in mammalian cells. There are many reasons to develop this high-throughput mammalian genetic technology. Currently there is no systematic method to unravel the assortment of genetic interactions that drive specific cancers and determine the variability of individual treatment responses. Nor is there a robust method to study gene interactions in other complex multigenic diseases such as Parkinson's.  We are motivated by the tremendous advances recently made in yeast and worms that have resulted from systematic discovery of genetic interactions. Genetic interaction maps in yeast have revealed functional relationships within and between protein complexes orders of magnitude beyond those revealed by protein- protein interaction screens. Systematic screening 65,000 pairs of genes in worms led to the identification of a class of highly connected `hub' genes encoding chromatin regulators. The technologies behind these discoveries depend on several high-throughput steps, including a dependable gene knockout or knockdown method, a method to deliver two gene knockouts/knockdowns into the same cell and to monitor which cells receive which combinations, and also a reliable assay to measure relative fitness.  Our major enabling technology for development of a high-throughput system for mammalian cells is the tandem-integration landing pad that allows two plasmids to be inserted next to each other at a neutral location of the genome. Each plasmid contains a DNA barcode that uniquely identifies the associated genetic perturbagen (e.g. sgRNAs). When both plasmids are integrated into the genome, the two barcodes are in close enough proximity to be sequenced together by paired-end amplicon sequencing. We have established this methodology in yeast and have shown that it can generate a library of >108 double barcoded cells via pooled sequential plasmid transformation and integration. The fitness of large double barcode libraries can then be measured using the fit-seq approach that we pioneered: pooled growth and double barcode amplicon sequencing over several time points accurately measures the relative fitness of each double barcoded cell in the pool. In yeast, Genetic interaction Sequencing (GiSeq) promises to be a cheaper and higher-throughput alternative to the commonly used synthetic-genetic array technology. In mammalian cells, GiSeq promises to be a major leap forward over existing technologies: not only will genome-scale interaction libraries become practical, but negligible work will be needed to repeat a screen in a different cells or different conditions.  For this proposal, we will establish the utility of GiSeq in mammalian cells (Aims 1 and 2), and prepare reagents to perform genetic interaction screens in vivo (Aim 3)."
"9139392","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of physically forced sex to dating violence remain high in college communities (22% of 10,000 female undergraduates disclosed these forms of violence against women (VAW) in the past 12 months (2010-2013).  Bystander interventions, recognized as promising violence prevention strategies, are unique in their engagement of all community members to 1) recognize situations that may become violent and 2) learn to safely and effectively intervene to reduce violence risk.  Based on their promise, the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act (SaVE) now requires all publicly-funded college to provide bystander intervention.  With SaVE's policy intervention requiring bystander intervention, a natural experiment has arisen to determine the relative efficacy of students' bystander training across multiple colleges.  We propose a quasi-experimental design with fractional factorials to evaluate the relative efficacy of bystander interventions components to reduce violence in college communities.  Green Dot will be one of the bystander intervention components evaluated because our group has considerable experience rigorously evaluating Green Dot and we have recently found that this bystander intervention is associated with a 20-40% reduction in VAW in college and high school settings.  Aim 1.  Compare the relative efficacy of bystander interventions to 1) increase bystander efficacy and behaviors, 2) reduce violence acceptance, 3) reduce violence victimization and perpetration, and 4) increase program cost effectiveness.  The three primary bystander groups compared will be:  a) exclusively online training, Green Dot (speeches and intensive bystander training), and other skills-based by stander training.  Program efficacy data will be obtained from student surveys, campus crime statistics, and surveys with college staff and administrators responsible for selecting and implementing bystander interventions.  We will collect data at each college for the full 4 years of the project (~50,000 students annually.  Infrastructure provided by the Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Science at the University of Kentucky and West Virginia University will support a VAW Research Coordinating Center for all electronic data collection and analyses from 24 recruited colleges, comparing the different bystander interventions.  VAW researchers draw from multiple disciplines yet few training programs support this diverse field of highly relevant applied research.  Thus, we seek to grow communities of VAW prevention researchers.  Researcher communities will form through researcher' engagement with college recruitment, survey design, data collection and analyses.  Aim 2.  Determine the efficacy of this program to increase VAW prevention research productivity defined as 1) increasing research skills and 2) increasing research communities measured as manuscript submissions, presentations, and publications.  This natural experiment will generate new understanding of how and what bystander components work to prevent violence.  It will also provide the VAW research community an opportunity to increase our skill-sets and share our experiences with and help grow the next generation of VAW prevention researchers."
"9146353","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transitioning from small numbers of neural depth recording electrodes to many thousands requires consideration not only of data management, but also how to non-destructively deliver these electrodes into the desired brain regions. Simply developing larger planar probes with more electrodes packed onto the surface invites increased immune response, likelihood of neuronal perturbation due to the presence of the large foreign substrate, and limited spatial sampling distributions. Here we propose to break the paradigm of mechanically stiff shuttles to insert electrodes, but instead will develop arrays of ultra-small 'slf-motile' electrodes that are each able to move to a target region under their own power, and with minimal perturbation of surrounding cells. This process is based upon electro-osmotic drives developed for microfluidics, which propel fluid along the electrode surface. We will investigate the device design and electrical optimization for guiding micron scale, flexible electrodes to specific locations. This will be complemented by organic electrochemical transistors as the recording elements, which are less sensitive to small sizes than metal electrode pads. The combination of minimal cell perturbation, ultra-small dimensions, and arbitrary three dimensional distributions will create a highly functional network of electrodes to record and modulate complex neural behavior throughout the brain. This non-perturbative, high-density sampling platform could have revolutionary impact both for fundamental neuroscience as well as clinical applications, such as brain-machine interfaces."

"9205077","PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL COMPONENT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, disability and death in the elderly. Despite recent advances in our understanding of basic biological mechanisms underlying AD, we do not yet know how to prevent AD or have an approved disease modifying intervention. Both are essential to slow or stop the growth in dementia prevalence. The National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) seeks to prevent and effectively treat AD by 2025 through innovative research on etiology, early detection, and therapeutics. In support of NAPA's goals, one of the targeted areas of research identified at the NIA sponsored 2015 Alzheimer's Disease Research Summit was the development of the next generation of animal models of AD that will prove more predictive in preclinical studies and thus accelerate the drug testing pipeline. While our current animal models of AD have provided multiple novel insights into AD disease mechanisms, thus far they have not been successfully utilized to predict the effectiveness of therapies that have moved into AD clinical trials. The Indiana University (IU)/Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Alzheimer's Disease Precision Models Center (IU/JAX ADPMC) will leverage IU's strengths in neurodegenerative research including 25 years as an NIA-supported Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) and considerable expertise in preclinical drug testing with JAX's eight decades of expertise in mammalian genetics and disease modeling to develop, validate and disseminate new, precise animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, the IU/JAX ADMPC contains Sage Bionetworks to provide expertise in data organization and dissemination. The IU/JAX ADPMC brings together an international, multi-disciplinary team?including geneticists and genetics technology experts, quantitative and computational biologists, clinical experts in AD and neuroimaging, pharmacologists and world leaders in the development of precision animal models of disease?that possesses the collective ability to foresee disease modeling needs as they emerge on the international stage. This will allow the IU/JAX ADPMC to serve the AD scientific community effectively and efficiently. The IU/JAX ADPMC will generate new AD modeling processes and pipelines, data resources, research results and models that will be swiftly shared through JAX's and Sage's proven dissemination pipelines and through the NIA- supported AD Centers, academic medical centers, research institutions and the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. Ultimately, this will accelerate the application of advances in animal models for the greatest possible medical benefit. The Specific Aims of the IU/JAX ADPMC are: 1. Maximize Human Datasets to Identify Putative Variants, Genes and Biomarkers for AD. 2. Generate and Characterize the Next Generation of Mouse Models of AD. 3. Validate the Next Generation of Mouse Models of AD and Develop a Preclinical Testing Pipeline. !"
"9165606","ABSTRACT Alcohol-related harm among young adults remains a major public health problem associated with both morbidity and mortality. As most young adults attend college, this environment remains a critical setting for prevention and intervention research. Alcohol research studies focused on community college (CC) students remain rare, and these colleges often face scarce resources to prevent, identify and intervene with problem alcohol use. Thus, online interventions may be a valuable approach for community college campuses. Online interventions such as Web-based Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (Web- BASICS) have successfully reduced problem alcohol use and associated negative consequences among university students. Given that social media use is nearly ubiquitous in the young adult population, social media may provide novel opportunities to engage with CC students, identify those at risk using displayed social media alcohol references, and provide links to online interventions. Our long-term goal is to use social media to identify problem alcohol use among CC students and provide feasible, scalable and targeted interventions. The objectives of this application are to first adapt and refine Web-BASICS for use among CC students and paired with social media, and second to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of using social media to identify at-risk CC students and provide a validated online intervention: Social Media (SM) BASICS. In this two-phase study, Phase 1 will involve focus groups with 30 CC students towards refinement of Web-BASICS to SM-BASICS. In Phase 2 we will recruit 200 CC students from two campuses. Consented participants will be ?friended? on Facebook, as an exploratory evaluation participants who also use Instagram will be ?followed? on this site. Participants? social media profiles will be evaluated monthly throughout one year for new alcohol or problem drinking displays, or escalated displays (participants who previously displayed alcohol references then display problem drinking references). Participants who display new or escalated alcohol references will be randomized into intervention (I) or active control (AC) groups. Participants will then be contacted to complete SM-BASICS or active control within 48 hours of identifying the social media alcohol display, then at 1 and 6 month follow-ups. Pilot intervention outcomes will assess 1) proportion of participants with timely SM-BASICS (I) or active control (AC) assessments after social media alcohol display, 2) acceptability of linking social media alcohol displays to SM-BASICS, and 3) early efficacy and effect sizes towards planning a future large randomized controlled trial. Given the ongoing popularity and ubiquity of social media among the young adult population, this innovative tool has potential to improve community colleges? capacity to provide timely and targeted interventions. Parents, administrators and other adults, who also use social media such as Facebook, may have opportunities to use this tool towards future intervention efforts."
"8999048","Project Summary/Abstract  The USC Norris Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) has two organizational components, the  Clinical Investigations Committee (CIC) and the Scientific Progress and Accrual Monitoring Subcommittee.  During the project period, PRMS has been significantly improved, resulting in reduced turnaround time and  fewer low accruing trials. Members of the CIC now represent a broad range of scientific disciplines and the  clear majority is senior investigators. To assure quality reviews, we have clarified member selection criteria and  term limit policies. We have also increased the frequency of CIC meetings and attendance rates, enhanced  scientific review and prioritization processes, improved written communications with PIs, and added maximum  PI response times to reduce delays. A new operational and financial review process has been added and  integrated into the PRMS workflow to assure operational feasibility without increasing turnaround. These and  other improvements have improved quality in the initial scientific review process and halved time to PRMS  approval, which averages four weeks. To enhance scientific monitoring of approved trials and to close trials  that are not achieving their enrollment targets more quickly, we formed a dedicated Scientific Progress and  Accrual Monitoring Subcommittee. The resulting structure completely separates scientific review and quality  assurance. With this organizational change, an existing accrual monitoring policy was tightened so that we can  close trials that are consuming institutional resources and are not enrolling at a reasonable pace. In summary,  the current PRMS process is highly effective in selecting and supporting investigator initiated trials and recent  changes having a very positive impact on both quality and efficiency. Additional improvements will be achieved  as OnCore is fully implemented and longer-term results are realized."
"9166391","Project Summary  Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease; however it is also linked with cognitive decline and dementia. We have shown that MetS is associated with lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) and memory function in late middle-aged adults at increased risk for developing Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Insulin resistance (IR) is at the core of MetS, and a hallmark feature of IR is higher fasting blood glucose (FBG) as well as post prandial hyperglycemia.  While we and others have demonstrated links between IR and CBF as well as cognition from an observational perspective, no studies have investigated CBF and cognition after an intervention involving exercise and a carbohydrate restricted diet (CRD) designed to improve or normalize IR and glucose homeostasis. We propose to determine the effect of improving or normalizing glucose homeostasis on CBF and cognition, through diet and exercise, in individuals with IR and at risk for the development of AD.  While exercise and a CRD have been shown to improve IR and glycemic control, we have only limited knowledge of the mechanisms behind these improvements. Nutritional metabolomics, the global measurement and interpretation of metabolic profiles, assesses the interaction of diet with the endogenous gene-protein cascade and the gut microbiome. Additionally, exercise has been shown to have an impact on the human metabolome. Finally, numerous metabolites have been specifically linked to IR and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). We propose to use metabolomics to measure changes in metabolites as individuals normalize or improve IR and glucose homeostasis.  Should this exploratory study reveal increased brain blood flow and improved memory in response to diet and exercise, then early treatment of these individuals at risk might offer new avenues for disease-course modification. Strategies towards early and effective risk factor management could be of value in reducing the risk of metabolic as well as cognitive decline. In addition, should this study reveal changes in metabolic abnormalities consistent with early indications of diabetes, metabolomics could be an effective approach to complement disease risk analysis in our goal toward precision care."
"9198162","ABSTRACT This exploratory/developmental application proposes to determine the acceptability of a promising new intervention using real-time adherence monitoring and to determine reasons for missed antiretroviral therapy (ART) doses in young AAMSM. Adherence to ART is critical to prevent morbidity, mortality, and emergence of resistant virus. Adherence to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretrovirals is critical to prevent HIV transmission. In the US, African American men account for the largest proportion of new HIV infections by race and disproportionately experience associated mortality. Among HIV-positive persons treated with ART, African Americans are significantly less likely than Whites and Hispanics to be virally suppressed. In addition, young MSM have low adherence to PrEP. Guided by the Information Motivation, Behavioral Skills Model, real-time adherence monitoring with a triaged response to missed doses may increase patient information about the consequences of non adherence, motivate medication adherence, and positively influence adherence behavioral skills, resulting in improved behavior that leads to viral suppression and/or more sustained protective PrEP drug levels. The proposed study will recruit young AAMSM from high HIV incidence neighborhoods where improvement in ART adherence has the potential to produce high personal and public health gain, potentially contributing towards lowering HIV incidence rates in these communities. The aims of this study are to: 1) Determine the acceptability of real-time adherence monitoring in young AAMSM by conducting participative formative research with focus groups of young HIV-positive AAMSM patients with detectable viral load in the past 12 months and young AAMSM who are taking PrEP and; 2) Conduct qualitative interviews to determine reasons for missed doses detected in real-time in young HIV-infected AAMSM patients who had a detectable viral load in the past 12 months. We will analyze interview data to identify salient behavioral and/or emergent subpopulation factors that contribute to non adherence. These data will provide a deeper understanding of ART adherence than previous retrospective studies and will inform development of a theory-driven real-time ART adherence intervention including choice of response messages, understanding to what extent perceived social/logistic factors may contribute to these events, and exploring subject's motivation to address reasons for missed doses to prevent future events."
"9237042","Project Summary/Abstract  Opioid Use Disorder has seen an epidemic rise in the United States over the past decade. More than 250 million prescriptions for opioids are written each year along with increasing rates of illegal heroin use. Greater than 4 million Americans report using prescription pain medicine for non-medical reasons. Colorado has outpaced the rest of the nation and recently ranked as high as number 2 in the nation for rates of self-reported nonmedical use of prescription pain killers. Opioid overdoses killed 41 Coloradans per month in 2014 and 14 of the 24 counties in our proposed project have drug overdose rates greater than 16 per 100,000 placing them among the worst in the nation.  There are evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for prescribing opioids and for treating Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). However, the magnitude of the work required to disseminate and implement evidence from medical research into clinical practice has been underestimated. Myriad barriers to implementation include: complex definitions, the diverse nature of primary care, and unique cultural aspects or rural communities. Implementation must be more than simply transposing one program into another venue.  Over the past 5 years, the High Plains Research Network in rural eastern and southern Colorado has identified Opioid Use Disorder as a primary concern to our physicians, practices, and community members. HPRN providers and community members point out the problems they face; lack of community knowledge and awareness of OUD and medication assisted treatment (MAT), limited access to diagnostic and treatment services for OUD, and the complete lack of MAT.  The HPRN has a goal to change the trajectory of this epidemic, improve the community level awareness of OUD, and successfully manage patients with OUD through primary care practice-based Medication Assisted Treatment. First, we propose to increase local community awareness and knowledge by completing a Boot Camp Translation, transforming the complex language and concepts of OUD and MAT into locally relevant, actionable messages and materials. Second, we will provide up-to-date evidence-based education on OUD and MAT comparing onsite and online training models. Finally, we will provide rural primary care practices with Opisafe, a robust web-based opioid and MAT patient engagement and monitoring system that provides valuable patient-centered follow-up tracking and complies with and meets all federal and state regulatory requirements. Mixed-method evaluation will identify the impact of community awareness on implementation success, identify the best methods for practice and provider team- based education, and the impact of an innovative web-based registry and tracking system on implementation and patient outcomes."
"9132334","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Background. Recent evidence points to the importance of the initial colonization of the human body with microorganisms-the establishment of the microbiome-as a determinant of health outcomes throughout life. The metagenomic technological advances available for characterizing the human microbiome across large cohorts at multiple time points are rapidly out-pacing the computational tools needed to clarify patterns of assembly of the microbiome and investigate connections between observed patterns and health and disease. Network-based methods have immense promise for filling this critical gap, but there are major limitations in the available suie of network analytic tools. The identification of clinically relevant patterns in biological network, and in particular, temporally evolving networks, urgently requires novel methodological approaches.         Candidate. Dr. Hoen is a computational epidemiologist mentored by a multidisciplinary team within the Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Sciences (iQBS) and the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College. With her PhD in infectious disease epidemiology at Yale University and her postdoctoral training in the Children's Hospital Boston Informatics Program/Harvard Medical School, she is extremely well qualified to successfully accomplish her proposed research and career development plan and transition to independence as a scientist in biomedical informatics with the support of this award. Dr. Hoen has an established, productive research background that has resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications on her interdisciplinary research.         Environment. iQBS and the Geisel School of Medicine offer the ideal environment for the proposed career development and research. A collegial intellectual environment, at the core of which is Dr. Hoen's exemplary team of mentors and advisors is bolstered by numerous state-of-the-art research centers and core facilities, including a world-class supercomputing facility. Regular research seminars address current advances in biomedical informatics, genomics and biostatistics, and frequent lecture series in informatics, genomics and medicine attract leading investigators from around the world.     Career Development Plan. The goal of this proposal is to gain mentored research experience and career development activities in order to advance Dr. Hoen' career into that of an independent researcher in biomedical informatics. Dr. Hoen's previous research has focused on computational studies of the distribution and determinants of infectious disease risk. She has experience in the analysis of microbial genomic data (doctoral training) and in public health informatics (postdoctoral training). The proposed career development activities and mentored research experience would take Dr. Hoen's expertise to a new level in two distinct ways: (1) by providing her mentored research experience in the development, evaluation and application of novel tools for biomedical informatics research; and (2) by providing her training in biomedical informatics for clinical and translational research. Dr. Hoen proposes to participate in coursework, workshops, seminar series, and research meetings that focus on professional ethics, translational research methods, computational biology including genomics, metagenomics, network analysis, and systems biology. Dr. Hoen has assembled an exemplary mentoring team, led by Dr. Jason Moore, who has a longstanding history of mentorship, leadership, and funded research in biomedical informatics. Her team of mentors and advisors include internationally known experts on informatics methods development, network analysis and complex systems, computational analysis of metagenomic data, clinical and translational science, epidemiology and biomedical informatics leadership. The collective expertise embodied by this team will provide an outstanding resource for the development of Dr. Hoen's career and the successful execution of her multidisciplinary, translational research in biomedical informatics. Dr. Hoen's team is committed to ensuring that she achieves a successful mentored research and career development experience as she works toward independence within the timeframe of this award.         Research Plan. The goal of the proposed research is to develop, evaluate and apply computational tools that capture the complexity of large, longitudinal datasets of microbial community composition in conjunction with rich clinical information from a unique ongoing large molecular epidemiologic study using a systems approach that focuses on the complex interactions between human hosts, the communities of bacterial taxa that comprise the microbiome, exposures, health and disease. The framework upon which this research will be built is a series of networks that represent the complex interactions between infants and microbial colonization patterns in light of early life exposures and health-related outcomes. The analyses proposed will address complex patterns captured by these networks including multi-scale associations, multi-way interactions between network components, and temporal dynamics in changing networks. The overarching hypothesis of this research is that these innovative approaches can reveal critical associations between microbiome composition and health and disease in early life. The translational potential of this research lies in novel opportunities to reduce disease risk through therapies that manipulate and preserve a healthy microbiome."
"9320335","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient safety experts worry that CPOE systems that allow multiple patient records open at once increases the risk of wrong patient errors. A recent national survey of Chief Medical Information Officers demonstrated the lack of consensus on the safest number of patient records to allow opened at once, with marked heterogeneity in the number of records currently allowed open by IT leadership. Our application will be the first study to provide IT leaders data on the risk of wrong patient errors when varying number of records are opened at once, which will help them make a more informed decision on the best configuration for their CPOE systems. We propose a large observational study to examine the relationship between the number of records open and the risk of wrong-patient error (Aim 1). It is possible, however, that clinical environments where providers are more likely to open more than one record at a time may also be the clinical settings in which wrong patient errors are more likely to occur, and the type of clinical setting or other factors may confound the observational study. To address the threat of confounding, we also propose a two-armed crossover pilot study in which the CPOE system will be configured to limit the number of records opened to one patient at a time for roughly half the inpatient beds (restricted environment), while the other half of the inpatient beds will be allowed to open a maximum of four records at once (unrestricted environment); midway through the pilot study these configurations will be reversed (Aim 2). A comparison of the wrong-patient error rates in the restricted and unrestricted cohorts will help further quantify the risk of having multiple records open at once. This study is made possible by an innovative tool for identifying wrong patient electronic orders that was developed and validated at Montefiore Medical Center. This tool, which identified an average of 14 wrong patient errors a day at Montefiore, will be used to identify the primary outcome measures for both the prospective, observational study as well as a two-armed crossover pilot study. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) In a prospective, observational study, assess the relationship between the number of records open at the time of placing an order, and the risk of placing an order on the wrong patient. 2) In a two-armed crossover pilot study, compare the incidence of wrong-patient orders in a restricted environment that limits its providers to only one record open at a time to an unrestricted environment where users can open a maximum of four records at once. This project is a collaboration between Montefiore Medical Center and the Brigham and Women's Hospital, with Dr. David Bates leading an Expert Advisory Panel of national leaders in Informatics and Patient Safety research. This project directly addresses AHRQ's special emphasis notice, as it is a research project that will provide evidence to inform the safe use of health IT."
"9197172","Abstract  This project pursues the fundamental nature of the relationship between the early ocular vasculature (blood vessels and blood supply) and the developing neural retina. Although much is known regarding disorders related to the pathological persistence of the hyaloid vasculature in mammals, and pathologies involving the retinal vasculature, the developmental importance of the early ocular vasculature for the developing structures of the eye remains unknown and unstudied. Filling this knowledge gap will have tremendous impact. Abnormalities of the ocular vasculature are critical mediators of pathological progression in numerous retinal diseases. Access to a blood supply, and specific roles for endothelial cells are known to exist within other developing systems, and results from a small number of published developmental gain-of- function studies (those which increase vessel development) suggest a role for the early ocular vasculature in regulating development of the adjacent neural retina. In addition, studies using co-culture models suggest that direct cellular contact of neural progenitors with endothelial cells influenced neural stem cell proliferation and retinal cell differentiation. Our published and preliminary data provide further evidence that a regulatory relationship exists and is required in the developing eye in vivo, such that the early ocular vasculature must be present for normal retinal neurogenesis, and this requirement is not strictly metabolic. We now propose to discover the specific role of vascular endothelial cells in the control of retinal neurogenesis.  Our objective in this application is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying retinal abnormalities in embryonic zebrafish models for vascular dysgenesis. The embryonic zebrafish is ideal for these studies because the tissues are not yet dependent upon circulating hemoglobin for oxygenation, thus allowing innovative experimental manipulations of the vasculature that uncover non-metabolic, developmental roles for the vasculature. We propose to test the hypothesis that factors derived from the endothelial cells of the early ocular vasculature are necessary for normal retinal neurogenesis, by pursuit of two Specific Aims. 1. Define the roles of circulating vs. local endothelial cell-derived factors in regulating retinal neurogenesis and gliogenesis. 2. Identify regulatory targets of endothelial-derived factors.  This project will lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at identifying endothelial- derived and circulation-derived factors and understanding their roles in retinal stem cell niches in embryonic eyes, regions of persistent neurogenesis, during retinal regeneration, and in vascular pathologies of the retina."
"9144766","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Improving safe medication use by decreasing preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) is a fundamental priority for transforming the U.S. health care system. The National Action Plan for ADE Prevention (NAP) seeks to support providers, systems and researchers in ensuring the safest care of patients by preventing ADEs from the high priority medication classes of anticoagulants, diabetes agents and opioids. The evidence base for how to effectively prevent or mitigate risk factors for ADEs in the outpatient setting is underdeveloped and there are limited examples of engaging patients in the safety improvement process. The proposed project is a natural evolution of medication safety (MS) research in PPRNet, an AHRQ Center for Primary Care Research and Learning at the Medical University of South Carolina, and consistent with its 15-year history of translating research into real world primary care practice. The project aims to first, clarify risk factors for ADEs from high priority medications through a literature review and translate them into a working set of clinical quality measures that can be implemented in primary care and second, use a community engaged action (CEA) research approach to test the impact of a refined set of preventive strategies for ADEs on practice performance on clinical quality measures in a group-randomized trial. Three significant innovations in the proposed method are: 1) identification of primary care- relevant ADE risk factors for HPM and strategies to prevent them, 2) development of acceptable, reliable and valid ADE CQMs using a modified Delphi method among primary care providers and 3) inclusion of patients in a community engaged action research intervention among real world primary care practices. PPRNet investigators and member practice communities are uniquely qualified to meet the objectives of this program announcement in order to address the prevention of harm and promote standardized and idealized practices and behaviors. Outcomes from this project will address key problems in the existing outpatient safety research paradigm by engaging primary care patients, non-professional caregivers, providers and practice staff in each aim and the multi-method plan for dissemination."
"9245247","This R21 application proposes to use a large cohort of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (2415 subjects) from the GENUS Consortium to clarify morphometric and genetic aspects of the corpus callosum (CC) and the lateral ventricles (LV) in schizophrenia (SZ). Our preliminary data indicate that LV and CC volume abnormalities are correlated in SZ, and index global functioning. Although abnormalities of LV and CC are hallmark of SZ and appear together in neurodevelopmental syndromes, LV and CC have rarely been studied together in SZ. Genetically, LV and CC are highly correlated, nonetheless the specific genetic determinants of this relationship are currently unknown. Recently, the SZ associated genetic risk variant miR137 has been shown to associate with LV and whole brain diffusion abnormalities in SZ where the two measures correlate. MiR137 has also been associated with poor cognitive and high negative symptoms load SZ, characterized by poor global functioning. By employing the unprecedented power of the GENUS cohort we will be able to clarify what appears to be a convergence of neuroimaging, symptomatology, cognitive measures and genetics information of LV and CC, and their relationship in one single large population of SZ and HC. This study is expected to provide novel data on the junction between morphometric measures of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles, their genetic background and their relation with symptoms and cognition in SZ and to identify subgroups of SZ based on these variables. The long term ramification of this proposal is the identification of novel therapeutic targets, based on miR137. T herapeutics based on miRNA, like miR137, are already been used in phase I cancer clinical trials, a disease that like SZ is polygenic. Finally, our study will reveal new information on the genetics of SZ and its relationship to symptomatology and brain variables."
"9187784","Project Summary This submission is prepared in response to RFA-ES-15-013, which will establish a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - Nanotechnology Health Implications Research (NHIR) Consortium: Comprehensive Evaluation of Interactions Between Engineered Nanomaterials (ENMs) and Biological System U01s. The NHIR Consortium will collaborate to investigate the interaction between ENMs and biological systems to provide comprehensive response profiles of ENM exposures to guide development of benign ENMs and support safe and sustainable use of nanotechnology. The aim of this proposal is to investigate Consortium-selected ENMs, with a broad range of physicochemical properties, to reveal how early life ENM exposure impacts neurobehavioral and cardiovascular outcomes and cause changes in biochemistry. The developing neonate has immature gastrointestinal function, with a developing barrier function, that may allow greater uptake of ENMs than in an adult. The developing brain can be impacted by exposure to chemicals both directly and indirectly. The cardiovascular system has also been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of ENMs. The project will consist of three inter-related areas of investigation with the following aims:  1. To investigate the impact of ENMs on the integrity and permeability of the intestinal barrier in vitro. We will test the Consortium-selected ENMs in two well-established models of the small intestine using 1) enterocytes and goblet cells, and 2) enterocytes and M cells.  2. To determine the ENM tissue distribution and cellular localization in exposed neonatal and juvenile rats with determination of neurobehavioral and cardiovascular effects. The biological response to ENMs will be studied in female and male neonatal and juvenile rats with daily ENMs administered orally from postnatal day (PND) 2-20, and euthanized at PND 4, 9, and 21. Comprehensive assessment of the ENM tissue distribution, functional neurobehavioral observations, cardiovascular measurements, neurotransmitter measurement, and untargeted and targeted metabolomics analysis (aim 3) will be conducted on PND 4, 9 and 21.  3. To characterize perturbations in biochemical profiles of serum, brain tissue, and cecal contents associated with ENM exposure, and with neurological and cardiovascular assessments. Studies will focus on determining how ENMs perturb the biochemical profiles of the serum, brain tissue, and cecal contents of male and female rat pups. Assessments will include the use of NMR metabolomics, a 16 channel ECD CoulArray to simultaneously quantitate 20 neurotransmitters, and a quantitative assay for 188 compounds including acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, hexose, glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingolipids."
"9233719","In addition to the widely studied type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there are a number of monogenic inherited forms of this disorder, including Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). The genetic basis for the first MODY subtype was discovered 20 years ago through its association with mutations in the HNF4A nuclear receptor. This link with a transcription factor focused efforts on defining the central roles of Hnf4A in the key tissues where it controls metabolism: the liver, intestine, and pancreas. Genetic studies in mouse models, however, did not recapitulate the full range of symptoms associated with MODY1 ? in particular, the sustained hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia seen in the clinic. We discovered that the expression pattern of HNF4A is conserved through evolution, from flies to mammals, and that mutants for the Drosophila ortholog of Hnf4A (dHNF4) display a range of phenotypes that resemble those of MODY1 patients. These include adult-onset hyperglycemia, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, glucose intolerance, and reduced peripheral insulin signaling. In addition, our RNA-seq transcriptional profiling identified several functional groups of dHNF4-regulated genes that act in the tissues where the receptor is expressed in flies and humans. This includes widespread effects on inflammatory response pathways, similar to the role of Hnf4A in the mammalian intestine, as well as key genes involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that mitochondrial-encoded gene expression is significantly reduced in the mutant, and that dHNF4 protein localizes to mitochondria and binds specifically to the control region of the mitochondrial genome. dHNF4 also directly regulates nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins, demonstrating a central role in mitochondrial physiology. Given that only a few nuclear transcription factors have been identified in mitochondria, and their roles are poorly understood, we propose to undertake a detailed analysis of the mitochondrial functions of dHNF4 and link these to key downstream roles of the receptor. In addition, we will use Drosophila genetics to elucidate the interactions between mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and metabolic defects in the context of diabetes. Although these pathways are often associated in metabolic syndrome, their cause and effect relationships remain unclear. Our overall hypothesis is that dHNF4 acts in multiple tissues to maintain mitochondrial function and to suppress inflammation and diabetes. We propose three specific aims to (1) determine the tissue-specific functions of dHNF4, (2) determine the physiological functions of dHNF4-regulated pathways and target genes, and (3) characterize the evolutionary conservation of dHNF4 functions, from flies to mammals. Taken together, this research will provide a simple genetic system to dissect the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and diabetes, as well as an animal model for MODY1. Our results, in turn, can be used to guide future studies in mouse models as well as devise new potential therapeutic approaches for preventing and treating diabetes in humans."
"9269033","Title: 27th Annual Health Economics Conferences Abstract: The Department of Health Policy and Management at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health seeks funding to support continuation of the highly successful Annual Health Economics Conferences (AHEC) for 2016 to be held at Vanderbilt University. The AHEC conference uses a small conference format for rigorous presentation and discussion of health economics research, with special attention to its application to policy. In this context, the aims of these conferences are: (1) to advance the policy applicability of health economics by exploring theoretical issues with high potential for application to real-world health settings; (2) to improve the policy relevance of empirical health economics by fostering research that emphasizes the study of important current policy questions using rigorous methods; and (3) to develop the next generation of health economic scholars by placing promising junior economists with high-profile senior economists in an intensive 1.5-day, small group setting. Over the past 23 years, AHEC has been hosted by most of the major universities that offer advanced degree programs and have major funded research programs in health economics and health services research. The unique nature of each conference focus combined with the prestige of each university has ensured exceptionally high quality papers and serious interactions among conference participants. This conference will build upon past success by (1) retaining the core structure and tradition of AHEC, with extensive discussion of leading-edge, policy-relevant research in health economics and (2) addressing the current changing health care reform environment by including sessions that focus on critical issues in the quality, coverage and access to health care that are of current importance for public policy and AHRQ. "
"9260252","PROJECT ABSTRACT Thirty percent of individuals with stroke are under the age of 65 years. This number is projected to increase dramatically in the coming decades due to improved survival at the acute stage. Due to health disparities, younger stroke survivors have poorer access to physician care, lower medication affordability, and prolonged disability compared with older stroke survivors. Collectively, these factors contribute to the rising economic burden of stroke in America. YoungStroke is the first and only American advocacy organization formed to specifically address the unmet needs of young adult stroke survivors and their caregivers. It is a 501(c)3 nonprofit advocacy organization with a three-fold mission to (1) educate the public about the increasing prevalence of stroke among young adults and its devastating impact upon community life; (2) advocate for increased awareness and research about stroke in young adults and methods for prevention; and (3) change the status quo by creating a forum for innovative and viable solutions to the unique challenges faced by young stroke survivors. The objective of YoungStroke 2016 is to provide a high quality scientific forum to exchange information on risk factors and prevalence, treatment, and long-term care and survivorship of young adults with stroke, by bringing together the survivors, their caregivers and stroke researchers from around the world on the same platform. Its agenda and format directly align with participant feedback from the successful inaugural YoungStroke 2015 conference held in Jacksonville, Florida from June 27-29, 2015. YoungStroke 2016 again returns to Jacksonville, Florida ? strategically within the Stroke Belt region hosting America?s highest stroke mortality and morbidity. The specific objectives of the conference are to: (1) Identify the risk factors and prevalence of young stroke to create strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment; (2) Exchange information on programs from around the world to enhance post-acute and chronic management of stroke survivorship and reduce the burden of complications and disability. At the conclusion of the conference, the discussions will be summarized as white papers for public dissemination, and researchers will form collaborative teams to develop clinical research projects to test the effectiveness of the solutions proposed on primary, secondary and tertiary care prevention."
"9146901","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have an unknown toxic potential and the relationship between the biological effects and the physicochemical properties remains uncertain. Our long-term research goal is to enable an efficient and accurate safety profiling of ENM of varying characteristics and conditions of exposure that would enhance decision-making regarding human exposure risks. Our objective in this application is to determine serum compositional changes resulting from pulmonary ENM exposure that lead to systemic toxicity (vascular and neural, primarily). We propose the following specific aims, which will pair innovative ex vivo bioactivity outputs with advanced high-resolution mass spec compositional analysis. In the first Aim, we will ascertain mechanisms of pulmonary origin of modified circulatory components related to metalloproteinase activity and inflammation. Evidence suggests that circulating factors may be related to a) direct reactions of ENMs and pulmonary cellular/molecular components or b) degradation by-products of increased metalloproteinase activity and that the circulating components act through endothelial cell surface pattern recognition receptors. In the second Aim, we will assess neurovascular and central nervous system impacts arising from pulmonary ENM- induced serome modifications. Here, we will develop and optimize a sequence tag-based algorithm to enhance the identification of endogenous peptides within the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-responsive serome, which will facilitate evaluation of the ENM-induced bioactivation in the cerebrovasculature and the diffusivity of ENM-responsive serome factors across the blood brain barrier. Lastly, in the third Aim, we will assess MWCNT-associated circulatory characteristics and inflammatory potential in samples derived from an occupationally-exposed cohort. We will assess the serum bioactivity in terms of endothelial activation and link to personal breathing zone measurements of elemental carbon, a marker of carbon nanotube/nanofiber exposure. At the completion of this project, we expect to have identified key physiological and chemical factors that influence plasma-borne ENM toxicity. The successful completion of these studies is expected to constitute an important step towards preventing / attenuating adverse health effects associated with ENM exposure. An added benefit will be the generation of novel diagnostic technologies and biomarkers that can not only strengthen, but also expedite ENM safety assessments and exposure monitoring. The research results will directly address Strategic Goals 1, 2, and 4 of the 2013-2016 NIOSH Nanotechnology Research and Guidance Strategic Plan."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated comprehensive approach for detection, prevention, linkage to care and treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) among young adults (18-30 years old) who have a history of injection drug use (people who inject drugs, PWID) and live in 21 non-urban southern Ohio counties. We will accomplish this by collaborating with addiction treatment providers, public health agencies, and syringe exchange programs in the target areas to identify, test, refer and link PWID to prevention and treatment services. The target area includes 21 suburban (large fringe metro, small metro) and rural (micropolitian, non-core) counties in southern Ohio, 18 of which are classified as Appalachian. To develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address the high prevalence of HCV in southern Ohio, we will 1) identify and describe the demographic characteristics and risk behaviors and injection networks of young non-urban PWID, and test them for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV; 2) use Peer Navigators to link young non-urban PWID to addiction treatment programs and to primary care, mental health and specialty treatment (infectious diseases, hepatology), including linkage to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and expanded Ohio Medicaid; 3) use Peer Navigators to provide education on safe injection practices to prevent hepatitis and HIV; and link PWID to syringe exchange programs as available in target communities; 4) use a closed social networking site (SNS) to provide peer-facilitated support for the uninfected prevention group (Prevention Room) and for the linkage-to-care group for PWID with HBV, HCV and/or HIV infection (Treatment Room); available both online and via smartphone; and 5) perform follow-up assessment and re-testing of study participants for HCV within 12 months of study entry to determine rates of new HCV infection and reinfection after successful treatment. Since the majority of the target counties are in Appalachia, this proposal will address healthcare inequities that are endemic to this region, and will provide data on which to base future public health initiatives to reduce HCV among young non-urban PWID."
"9173691","Project Summary/Abstract The provider-patient relationship impacts healthcare access and production. In healthcare access, the relationship affects whether a patient has a usual source of care, successfully seeks care, and receives timely care. In healthcare production, the relationship determines the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of care. This project will examine the influence of the relationship on patient health-related behavior and outcomes.  The first subproject will investigate effects of continuity in the provider-patient relationship on patient behavior and outcomes. Provider continuity occurs when the same provider treats a patient over time. Provider discontinuities, defined as breaks in continuity, may affect the quantity and quality of healthcare. The project will determine the causal effects of provider discontinuities that occur with (a) individual physicians in multi- physician groups, (b) individual physicians in single-physician practices, and (c) entire multi-physician groups. The primary analysis will use event study methods to study discontinuity events due to physician exits from the profession and physician relocations outside provider markets. The secondary analysis will add instrumental variable methods to study potential discontinuity events due to physician relocations within provider markets.  The second subproject will investigate how factors in the provider-patient relationship contribute to healthcare variation. Provider-specific factors generate effects a provider would have on all patients, whereas patient-specific factors generate effects a patient would have at all physicians. The approach will first decompose healthcare variation into provider-specific factors, patient-specific factors, and idiosyncratic provider-patient match effects using methods from the firm-worker match literature. Second, it will identify (a) organization and physician characteristics that explain provider-specific effects and (b) provider-patient relationship characteristics that explain idiosyncratic provider-patient match effects. Third, it will characterize provider-patient sorting based on patient-specific and provider-specific factors. Finally, it will determine effects of healthcare provider organizations on referrals and associated provider choice using event study methods.  The analyses will use claims data from Original Medicare and Massachusetts insured, non-Medicare patients. The provider sample will consist of physicians in outpatient specialties, including primary care. The outcomes will be efficiency (Prevention Quality Indicators), major events (hospitalizations, mortality), spending, new diagnoses, medical care use (preventive, primary, specialty, and emergency care), and drug use.  The results will provide evidence on what changes to provider-patient relationships could improve healthcare access, quality, and efficiency. Potential policy and practice changes could increase provider continuity (e.g., regulate narrow network plans), strengthen provider-patient relationships in accountable care organizations (ACOs) or managed care plans, and promote efficient provider choice (e.g., offer more provider information, improve online searches, assign patient-specific default providers, restructure referral incentives)."
"8979626","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs in one out of eight Americans of age 65 and affects 43% of the elderly over 85. Current FDA-approved drugs provide short-term symptomatic relief of AD. There is a pressing need to discover new disease-modifying medications. AD is multifactorial in origin and progression. A drug attenuating several underlying factors is a preferred therapy for AD. Nomethiazoles are a class of small molecules that address synaptic dysfunction through NO/cGMP signaling and harness the neuroprotective and GABA-mimetic activities of a methylthiazole (MZ) pharmacophore. Activation of the NO/cGMP/CREB signaling pathway, essential for learning and memory, is known to be attenuated in AD brains; whereas, the MZ pharmacophore provides neuroprotection against neuronal loss and has anti-inflammatory actions in the brain. Preliminary data show that nomethiazoles reverse cognitive deficits, slow Aß accumulation, and provide a positive biomarker profile in AD transgenic mouse models. We have: positive data on the prototype nomethiazole in four different AD mouse models; a U01-funded drug discovery project that yielded 4 candidate 2nd generation nomethiazoles; and STTR Phase 1 data indicating improved pharmacokinetic properties of 2 of these candidates. The objective of this Phase 2 proposal is to de-risk and select one drug candidate for future full IND-enabling studies. In Aims 1 and 2, two advanced mouse models of AD will be used to select the preferred nomethiazole and to provide a unique spectrum of preclinical animal efficacy data: 1) E4FAD a transgenic mouse model of familial AD, incorporating human apoE4, the major genetic risk factor for AD, which increases risk 20-fold and is biased against women; and 2) an accelerated oxidative stress model of age- related AD that manifests age-dependent hallmark AD biomarkers, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. In Aim 1, rescue and reversal of cognitive decline will be studied in these models. In Aim 2, quantitative biomarkers will be measured of target engagement, attenuation of AD hallmark pathology and inflammation, and rescue of synaptic and neuronal function. In Aim 3, drug scale-up, selected rodent pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and safety pharmacology will be studied to de-risk full IND studies. Completion of Aims 1&2 and Aim 3 will provide persuasive evidence of prospective efficacy and safety, respectively."
"9169439","One of the most promising engineering contributions to medicine is the development of nanoscale drug capsules that are invisible to healthy tissue while specifically directed to attack a diseased site. In the last 10 years, nanomedicine has experienced a surge of new opportunities expanding therapy to undrugable proteins with the discovery that small exogenous RNA bits delivered to the cytoplasm are able to deploy the shutdown of specific genes. We are now able to make short (19-21 bp) RNA sequences that can in principle turn off any given gene but none of this technology is useful until an efficient delivery vehicle is identified. RNAi therapy is currently experiencing a revival due to remarkable improvements in efficacy and viability through oligonucleotide chemical manipulations and/or via their packaging into nano-scale carriers but at present there is no FDA approved system for the application in humans. The design of the next generation of siRNA carriers requires a deep understanding of how nanoparticle's physicochemical properties truly impart biological stability and efficiency. For example, we now know that nanoparticles need to be sterically stabilized in order to meet adequate biodistribution profiles. However, the central hurdle in siRNA carrier design remains at the cellular level. Typically, an RNA-carrying particle will penetrate the cell via endocytosis and rest trapped until decomposition. In this work we will highlight the fact that the disruption of endosomes encompasses membrane transformations (for example pore formation) that cost significant elastic energy. In addition to surface chemistry, nanoparticle size and shape have been identified as relevant parameters controlling cellular uptake. In this work we propose that nanoparticle structural interiors are a novel handle to regulate endosomal escape. Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have been long recognized as promising siRNA delivery vectors however virtually all studies are locked to the concept of using liposome formulations. In this work we will instill a new direction of LNP design where nanoparticle interiors comprise highly ordered networks of membranes with high surface-to-volume ratios and intrinsic membrane properties prone to disrupt endosomal membranes at minimal energetic cost. We will employ careful structural characterization of the nanoparticles combined with quantitative functional studies of siRNA delivery and gene knockdown to a variety of cell lines, including neurons and stem cells that are known to be hard to transfect. It is our goal to underpin the correlation between nanoparticle internal structures with the dynamic process of siRNA cellular delivery and enable the next generation of highly efficient RNAi nanomedicine."

Each of  the four projects will be faced with these challenges. It will be the responsibility of Core C to  collaborate with project researchers in developing novel computational methods and tools that  scale well. As an example, Project 1 will rely heavily on MCMC and high-dimensional  regression. Fitting parameters with these statistical models entail massive number of iterations,  so development of innovative approaches such as data-parallel algorithms for Graphics  Processing Units will be a critical activity of the core. Other projects involve deploying extensive  simulations that explore a constellation of model parameterizations, assumptions about disease  effects, false discovery rates, etc. To this end, we will streamline such processes with re-usable  code that can be easily tailored for specific simulation experiments."
"9194569","PROJECT DESCRIPTION Visual recognition ability, an integral aspect of adult behavior, relies on cortical networks that selectively process ecological stimulus categories such as faces, places, and words. How these regions emerge through development, however, is largely a mystery. The goal of the proposed research is to pioneer the application of a novel MRI technology to measure the normative development of tissue properties within human visual cortex. This will significantly advance our limited understanding of the anatomical constraints to changes in neural function and visual recognition ability, and will additionally shed important insights into the organizational principles of high-level vision beyond striate cortex. The general approach to this project is as follows. (1) In subjects ranging in age from childhood (5-12 years) to adulthood (22-28 years), we will acquire both quantitative anatomical MRI and functional MRI, in addition to behavioral measures of visual perception and recognition ability. (2) In category-selective regions of ventral temporal cortex, we will relate developmental differences in the macromolecular make-up of a cortical region to differences in its functional selectivity. We will additionally relate macromolecular differences across development to behavior. (3) Lastly, we will validate the in vivo quantification of ventral temporal cortical tissue properties with human postmortem histology through the construction of a novel in-to-ex vivo pipeline. By measuring the normative development of visual cortex, and producing a dataset we plan on making available to other researchers, our proposed project addresses NEI's mission to conduct research into the mechanisms of visual function, which will be of great use to researchers and clinicians seeking to understand neurodegeneration and atypical brain development as well. The proposed work is integral to furthering the academic career of the candidate towards becoming an independent research professor at a major university and will promote diversity of the workforce in health-related sciences"
"9254918","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Long emergency department (ED) wait times resulting from overcrowding occur on a daily basis in 10% to 30% of hospitals and at least once per week in 90% of hospitals. It is widely acknowledged that long wait times are correlated to poor health outcomes due to lack of timeliness and inability to administer treatment. While there are many causes of prolonged ED wait times, a predominant source is the high demand for radiology services, which provide 47 million X-rays to US EDs each year. While many X-rays are often performed for patients with time critical conditions, ~17 million are acquired for patients with suspected bone fractures, 50% of which are ?routine? in bones with simple geometries. In addition to delays caused by radiology backlog, acquiring an X-ray in the ED is resource and time consuming. This process typically involves the following: arrange time on the X-ray machine, transport the patient to the X-ray machine, acquire the X-ray image(s), transport the patient and image results back to the ED, acquire a disposition from the radiologist, and communicate disposition to the ED or orthopedic physician. Each ED-ordered X-ray consumes > 30 minutes with an additional > 30 minutes to acquire a radiologist disposition. The total cost of this process to the US healthcare system is an estimated $3.2B.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of a 3D ultrasound imaging system and new technologies was demonstrated in an ex vivo bone fracture model. The 3D ultrasound images were reviewed by two independent ED physicians who detected bone fractures with 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity. This Phase II proposal seeks funding to support the continued development of a 3D ultrasound imaging system for bone fracture detection. The key technological innovations of this project are focused on improvements to ultrasound-based bone visualization and include a new clinician-assist feature that enables automatic detection of suspected bone fractures. The long-term goal of this project is to demonstrate a 3D bone-imaging ultrasound system that facilitates the rapid detection of bone fractures, expedites care delivery within the Emergency Department, and lowers the risk of health complications associated with delays in treatment delivery.  The Phase II hypothesis is that the 3D ultrasound bone imaging system will exhibit substantially equivalent sensitivity and specificity as digital X-ray for the detection of fractures in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with suspected long bone fractures. Novel ultrasound imaging technologies central to this project will be optimized, integrated into the 3D ultrasound bone imaging system, and validated in both post-mortem human subjects and human clinical studies. Finally, the Phase II hypothesis will be tested in a 135 patient clinical study. With an estimated 8.5 million suspected bone fracture cases in approximately 5,000 EDs across the US each year, the estimated US market size for this proposed ultrasound imaging device is $200 M/yr."

"9103405","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients in step-down units (SDU) undergo continuous noninvasive vital sign (VS) monitoring to facilitate nurse detection of cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of a diagnostic and/or therapeutic response. Yet, our data and others show nurses do not readily identify CRI nor necessarily react in a timely fashion. Further, 75% of monitored SDU patients never become unstable, diffusing surveillance away from those in need. Current nursing surveillance strategies are imprecise and untargeted, leading to failure to detect CRI, and failure to rescue patients needing intervention. Smart clinical decision support systems (SDSS) that continuously process complex data from disparate sources can apply detection algorithms to alert clinicians of ongoing events (nowcasting) and those developing in future (forecasting) to refocus clinicians on high-risk patients, and apply supportive care earlier, or even care to prevent the CRI. In our prior R01 we developed a prototype SDSS using machine learning (ML) to process time series data and learn data patterns systematically preceding events in the near or far term. In that study, we: 1) assembled a complex expert-annotated multidimensional dataset from our existing 1/20 Hz physiologic monitoring data as the learning platform; 2) developed and validated ML models for dynamic CRI prediction, tested which were most effective in CRI nowcasting; and 3) used the SDSS to develop an early prototype CRI prediction graphical user interface (GUI) for nurses. Importantly, our models were also able to discriminate between real CRI and artifact in real-time with high sensitivity and specificity. We now propose to build on this work and enhance our models by: 1) prospectively collecting a multidimensional high-resolution (100-250Hz) dataset of non-invasive physiologic monitoring and electronic health record (EHR) data from two different medical center SDUs to create enhanced and generalizable CRI nowcasting capability, 2) using our existing and the expanding multicenter clinical datasets to precisely forecast CRI events and online artifact discrimination, and 3) create a robust SDSS platform for real-time precision CRI nowcast and forecast alerting; present alerts in a graphical user interface (GUI), iteratively develop the GUI in the simulation setting; and then pilot its use in a SDU. Permitting nurses to move toward SDSS-supported precision nursing surveillance, and know who will become unstable, when they will do so, and why-all in advance of overt instability manifestation-can shift CRI nursing care from reactive to preemptive. Developing a sensitive, specific, parsimonious and clinically practical means to predict patient instability has important implications for reducing preventable morbidity and mortality, eliminating alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, nursing care (monitoring frequency, case load and mixture, staff allocation) and care delivery systems (triage, bed allocation, prevention of adverse events)."
"9250369","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study addresses the relationship between the elaborate structure of the mammalian cone photoreceptor synapse and signaling in postsynaptic bipolar cell retinal pathways that are critical for visual perception. Cone photoreceptors mediate vision during daylight and use glutamate as their transmitter. One of the great insights into early visual processing is that cones contact two functional classes of bipolar cells, On and Off, which have different glutamate receptors that cause them to depolarize (i.e., signal) either at light-on or -off, respectively. Each functional class of bipolar cell can be subdivided into 5-6 anatomical types (cb1a/b, b2, cb3a/b, for Off bipolar cells). Recent work has shown that the different anatomical subtypes of Off bipolar cells 1) express different glutamate receptors (AMPA or kainate), 2) contact the cone terminal at distinct distances from transmitter release sites (in invaginations or at the terminal base), and 3) make different numbers of contacts with a cone terminal. These differences suggest that each type of Off bipolar cell may be specialized to carry a different component of the cone signal to ganglion cells, the retinal output neurons. However, our understanding of how receptor type, contact distance, and contact number lead to differences in Off bipolar cell signaling is far from complete. The first and second aims address the impact of contact number on signaling during conditions of steady light. The basic idea is that vesicle fusion at each of a cone's 20-40 synaptic ribbons is probabilistic, with a mean rate set by membrane voltage. Off bipolar cells make between 2-15 contacts with a cone terminal depending on type. The first aim will use simultaneous cone and Off bipolar cell recording to test key ideas about resampling of the cone signal at the synapse. Experiments will determine the fraction of a cone's ribbon sites sampled by each bipolar cell type, and whether individual contacts at the base of the terminal sample more ribbons than contacts within invaginations. The second aim will test the idea that the more ribbons a bipolar cell samples, the more accurate (or quicker) is its estimate of the cone signal. However, this accuracy comes at the metabolic cost of maintaining more synapses, and thus retinal pathways that don't require high accuracy or temporal precision may likely be fed by Off bipolar cells that make fewer cone contacts. The third aim examines the mechanisms of signaling at light-off, which also differs among the Off bipolar cell types. Cone depolarization at light-off produces a synchronous fusion of vesicles. We hypothesize that cone synapses with cb2 cells saturate during synchronous fusion, providing a mechanism to enhance rapid signaling of change within the visual scene. The ability to rapidly signal change can have utility for survival. We also hypothesize that cb1a cells make specialized contacts with cones that have a threshold non-linearity which may provide noise immunity. Specific experiments will determine the mechanisms of transient signal enhancement at the cone to cb2 and the threshold non-linearity at the cone to cb1a cell synapses."
"9341745","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insomnia is nearly twice as common among older adults as it is in the general population. This is of significant clinical concern as insomnia is a risk factor for new onset and recurrent psychiatric and medical illness. Taken together, the prevalence and consequences of insomnia in older adults suggests that insomnia should not go untreated. This potential clinical imperative is further underscored by 1) the reconceptualization of Insomnia within the DSM-5 and ICSD-3 as a disorder (vs. a symptom of other disorders) and 2) the findings that targeted treatment of sleep continuity disturbance may produce clinical gains for medical and psychiatric disorders that occur comorbidly with insomnia. Thus, at present, the question is not whether to treat but how to best treat the disorder in general, and specifically in the context of older adults. Of the available medical treatments, the best studied strategies are benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs). In both cases, treatment is typically accomplished with either nightly or intermittent dosing. In the case of nightly dosing (QHS), BZRAs have been found to be safe and efficacious for periods of up to a year. Less clear is whether such efficacy can be maintained over the course of years or decades. In the case of intermittent dosing (IDS), the reduced usage strategy is thought to extend the efficacy and safety half-life of pharmacotherapy, but at a cost: little or no clinical effects on non-medication nights. In order to address this issue, we propose to evaluate an alternative approach that is based on the behavioral principles of conditioning and reinforcement. Specifically, we propose to garner treatment responses with full dose treatment (1 month) and then conduct maintenance therapy using intermittent dosing with placebos on non-medication nights. This approach, by expectancy alone, should provide for better clinical outcomes than standard intermittent dosing. What makes the study theoretically interesting is the underlying concept: that the initial treatment response allows for the medication vehicle (the capsule) to become a conditioned stimulus for the therapeutic response (sleepiness and sleep) and that this can be maintained over time (if not indefinitely) with partial reinforcement. Building upon the findings from our prior investigation with partial reinforcement, we propose to assess two low frequency approaches to maintenance therapy in a three phase study. In Phase 1, all subjects receive zolpidem nightly for one month and are assessed for treatment response. In Phase 2, responders are randomized to one of four maintenance conditions for three months: Nightly medication use (QHS); one of two low frequency partial reinforcement conditions (1 or 3 active doses per week with placebos on non-medication nights); and a low frequency IDS condition (1 to 3 active doses per week, without placebos). Phase 3 will be an extension period to assess, over 9 months, the long-term durability of the approaches. The outcomes for the study will be: rate of relapse, latency to relapse, average sleep continuity, and number and severity of medical symptoms during treatment. The primary hypothesis for the study is that the partial reinforcement conditions will produce similar outcomes to nightly dosing and superior outcomes to the IDS condition."
"9355299","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An understanding of the neural mechanisms and computational principles of the human brain requires the study of non-human primates (NHP) in addition to small animals. NHP are the closest species to humans that can be readily studied invasively and have highly sophisticated perceptual, motor, and cognitive systems that share many similarities with our own. However, many of the most critical circuits of the NHP brain are not accessible to precise spatial and temporal observation and manipulation because they are buried more than 6 mm below the cortical surface, beyond the reach of current imaging modalities. The objective of this project is to explore and optimize an emergent technology (wave-front shaping) that will enable recording of large neuron populations and modulation of individually identified neurons, at any depth with minimal tissue damage, using a thin multimode optical fiber. The proposed method allows the formation of arbitrary three-dimensional light patterns at the fiber tip and reconstruction of high-resolution image information flowing across the fiber. The approach utilizes recent advances in theoretical understanding of wavefront shaping and multimode fibers as well as instrumentation for spatial modulation (Digital Mirror Devices). Preliminary results by the PI's group suggest the technique with its novel innovations has the required spatiotemporal bandwidth to sample large numbers of cells. However, this imaging paradigm is still in its infancy and needs to be adapted and optimized for brain studies before it can be applied in-vivo. The proposed approach has key advantages over existing bulky micro-endoscope probes and could be easily scaled up to record from multiple brain regions by lowering multiple fibers. At the end of this project we expect to be in a unique position to transfr the technique into practice through collaborations with neuroscience labs that can drive new discoveries in awake behaving non-human primates."
"9176462","Project Summary/Abstract: The goal of this study is to determine the impact of CD55 and JAK/STAT pathway dysregulation in alveolar macrophages (AMs) on chronic beryllium disease (CBD) progression. CBD is an important organ-specific immune-mediated disease, characterized by granulomatous lung inflammation, fibrosis, and death, due to end-stage respiratory insufficiency. Thus, CBD remains an important public health concern. The precursor to this disease (beryllium sensitization; BeS) progresses to CBD at a rate of approximately 6-8% per year. Although the binding and presentation of Be via ?Glu69-containing HLA-DP molecules to pathogenic CD4+ T cells provides an explanation for the genetic linkage of DP2 to CBD and BeS, this does not explain the progression of BeS to CBD. Furthermore, DP2 is found in up to 40% of Be-workers without evidence of BeS or CBD. Thus, additional mechanisms must be involved in progression of BeS to CBD. Our hypothesis is that CBD AMs downregulate the negative immunoregulatory gene CD55 and its pathway and overexpress the positive regulatory activating JAK/STAT pathway, which augments the immune response to Be and progression from BeS to CBD. In Aim 1, we will define if CD55 on AMs is a negative regulator in the immune response to Be in AMs from BeS patients. Specifically, using either the overexpression of the CD55 genes using a adenovirus overexpression system and agonistic antibody or the reduction of CD55 genes using adenovirus knockdown system and neutralizing antibody of CD55, we will determine the impact of alteration of CD55 on consequential functional changes in TNF-? production, phenotype (CD16, CD40, CD80, CD86, HLA- DR), JAK/STAT activation and BeLPT comparing CBD, BeS and controls. Finally, using RNA-seq, we will investigate the regulatory networks associated with the downregulation of CD55 in CBD compared to BeS; In Aim 2, we will determine if the JAK/STAT pathway is a positive regulator of the immune response to Be in AMs and is increased in AMs from subjects with CBD compared to BeS. Specifically, AMs from CBD will be compared to those from BeS and controls subjects, assessing either the overexpression of the JAK/STAT pathway genes using a adenovirus overexpression system or the reduction of the JAK/STAT pathway genes using adenovirus knockdown system and pharmacological JAK1- 3 inhibitors on the Be immune response. We will evaluate the changes in TNF-? production, phenotype (CD16, CD40, CD80, CD86, HLA-DR), and BeLPT. Finally, using RNA-seq we will define the regulatory networks associated with the overactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether the CD55 and JAK /STAT pathway are associated with CBD and progression from BeS to CBD, compared to BeS, using a longitudinal study and validate these findings in a larger longitudinal population to determine if these genes and pathways reveal potential novel biomarkers of diagnosis and prognosis for CBD. At the end of this project we will determine the key regulatory genes and pathways of exposure-mediated immune dysregulation in AMs that are associated with disease progression and reveal potential biomarkers for clinical prognosis and diagnosis. The results obtained from this study will improve our understanding of factors involved in the development of CBD, as well as targets for therapy, and will serve as a model of other exposure-related immune responses and environmentally-induced chronic diseases."
"9137383","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Novel Brain Signal Feedback Paradigm to Enhance Motor Learning After Stroke Problem. Stroke damages brain neural structures that control coordinated upper limb movement, causing dysfunction and compromised quality of life. Existing and emerging treatment methods, which are only peripherally-targeted to limbs or directed only at the brain, show limited efficacy in upper extremity (UE) functional recovery in many survivors. Thus, there is a critical need for an innovative, transformative strategy to restore normal coordinated UE movement and functional task performance. Purpose. We will engage the remaining neuronal tissue and pathways in stroke survivors through a precise brain neural feedback system. First, real time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) will provide feedback regarding the specific brain region(s) that the stroke survivor should up-regulate. Second, in sequence, we will then employ real time functional near-infrared spectroscopy (rtfNIRS) to provide the more repetitive practice of an array of movements (not possible in the MR scanner) required to induce the brain plasticity that can drive recovery of more normal UE coordination. Third, to engage Hebbian principles of learning, we will use our fNIRS-triggered functional electrical stimulation (FES), producing affective signals from joint and muscle sensory receptors to the brain motor control system. Fourth, we will subsequently provide a series of motor learning sessions (without brain neural feedback) in order to provide the means for the learner to consolidate and generalize the coordination training to more normal functional task performance. Aim I. Test the innovative coordination training protocol of combination rtfMRI/rtfNIRS brain neural feedback and peripherally-directed, neurally-triggered FES-assisted coordination practice within a framework of motor learning principles. The aim focuses on re-training of wrist extension coordination because it is impaired, but essential for grasp preparation and stable maintenance of the hand for functional use. Hypothesis 1. Chronic stroke survivors will show significant improvement in upper limb function in response to the combined rtfMRI/rtfNIRS brain neural feedback and peripherally-directed, neurally-triggered FES-assisted coordination practice within a framework of motor learning principles. (Primary measure: Arm Motor Abilities Test; AMAT; secondary measures include: AMAT Wrist/Hand subscale; Fugl-Meyer upper limb coordination; and quality of life (Craig Handicap Assessment Rating Tool)). Secondary Aim II. Measure changes in brain activation patterns in response to proposed treatment. We will measure baseline and treatment response according to brain activation volume, intensity, centroid location, and white matter integrity. Objective. During wrist extension, we will measure baseline and treatment response according to brain activation volume, intensity, centroid location, and white matter integrity. Significance. The proposed intervention is a new direction for the PI's laboratory and may be paradigm- shifting in its concept and potential restoration of motor function after stroke."
"9127135","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous clinically used agents contain the ester chemotype, a moiety frequently added to small molecules to improve their water solubility and bioavailability. However the inclusion of this function in these compounds makes them substrates for carboxylesterases (CEs), enzymes that can either inactivate or activate these agents. Typically examples include the anticancer agent CPT-11 (irinotecan, Camptosar) that is a prodrug of SN-38, a potent topoisomerase I poison, and the antiviral drug oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) that requires hydrolysis to the carboxylate form to yield the active neuraminidase inhibitor. Hence, compounds that might inhibit the hydrolysis reactions would limit the efficacy of these drugs. We have identified a class of compounds (tanshinones) that are present within the Chinese herbal medicine Danshen. Extracts from this material can potently inhibit human CEs and modulate drug activity in vitro. Importantly however, the FDA has just approved the use of Danshen in clinical trials. Hence any esterified drug that is administered in conjunction with the herbal medicine might lead to reduced molecule hydrolysis, thereby mitigating the efficacy of the agent. We seek therefore, to evaluate the active component(s) in Danshen and to assess whether these molecules can modulate drug activity in defined animal models. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To determine the inhibitory compounds present within Danshen; 2) to assess the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by these compounds; 3) to assess the biological activity of these extracts in vitro; and 4) to determine the effect of such compounds/extracts on drug efficacy in animals models. We anticipate that compounds present within Danshen will inhibit the CEs in vivo, resulting in significantly reduced drug hydrolysis, and as a consequence, reduced drug efficacy. Since this material is currently in clinical trials, the information derived from these studies may identify novel drug:drug interactions that potentially would impact the effectiveness of clinically used esterified compounds. We envisage that the studies proposed here will validate this hypothesis and provide information concerning the use of such extracts in defined patient populations."
"9144666","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The surveillance of medical devices using prospective registries ideally provides critical information to all relevant stakeholders about device safety, long-term product performance, and effectiveness in improving patient outcomes. However, there are several challenges that must be overcome to successfully employ a registry-based post-market surveillance system for medical devices related to the diversity and complexity of medical devices, the iterative nature of product development, the learning curve associated with technology adoption, and the relatively short product life-cycle. Furthermore, novel methodological approaches are needed to manage incomplete ascertainment of adverse events and outcomes and lack of standardization of endpoint definitions, as well as a common method to define the relationship between device, or machine, failure and clinical events. Solutions to these challenges are most likely to emerge from industry, academic institutions, and government collaborations, each bringing their respective strengths and perspectives. Moreover, such collaborations are important for the credibility and integrity of the effort. Accordingly, we propose an industry-academic partnership between Medtronic and Yale, organizations currently collaborating to develop a device surveillance registry network and infrastructure, ideally integrated with other federal efforts such as the Medical Device Epidemiology Network Initiative (MDEpiNet). Over the course of the five-year project, the partnership will convene a series of stakeholder meetings that include methodological experts in post-market surveillance, industry, academics, government, clinicians, and patients to develop the critical methods needed to proactively monitor medical devices as well as the policies that define roles and responsibilities of expert parties engaged in the medical device surveillance ecosystem. This includes policies and procedures to assure integrity of the effort, strategies for sharing of device, clinical and quality data among clinical investigators and others, policies to promote transparency that can be applied to such collaborations, and novel methodological approaches to data collection (including device follow-up and Unique Device Identification compliance) and analysis that address the deficiencies that undermine existing medical device surveillance registry systems."
"9252965","The purpose of this Phase II research project is to evaluate and market an innovative health message intervention to increase uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and reduce women?s cervical cancer risk through partnership with Planned Parenthood. The overall aim is to reach a broad population through Planned Parenthood, the nation?s leading sexual and reproductive health care center, especially among low socioeconomic status (SES) and historically underserved populations. Despite an overall increase in vaccination and reduction in HPV-related infections in younger populations targeted by previous health promotion efforts, young adult women who are recommended for vaccination demonstrate much lower vaccination rates and higher rates of infection. In a recent Phase I grant, we developed and demonstrated the usability and feasibility of an innovative, culturally-grounded, technology-based narrative intervention that delivers decision narratives in the form of videos via a health kiosk, an underutilized communication strategy for reaching less involved audiences. This brief, low-cost, easily implementable intervention doubled the uptake of the vaccine in a separate pilot study. The proposed Phase II project will: (1) Complete development of the intervention, (2) Evaluate its effectiveness through a randomized clinical trial, and (3) Prepare the product for the market. To accomplish these aims, we will develop the intervention for implementation in waiting rooms as part of check-in procedures and exam rooms as part of intake. Our pilot research suggests these are both viable implementation strategies. Development includes programing and installing tablets to accomplish these tasks (Aim 1). We will then conduct the evaluation study in six Planned Parenthood clinics in southeastern Pennsylvania (Aim 2). In the waiting room condition, women will complete check-in via a tablet and that information used to identify and recruit eligible volunteers (unvaccinated women aged 18-26). In the exam room condition the intervention will be viewed on a tablet as part of the intake procedure, facilitated by a nurse or other designated clinic staff. Eligible women will be consented, complete a pretest, and then randomized to view the brief intervention or attention control messages via the tablet. After viewing the messages, they will complete a short posttest. Participants will receive follow up texts/emails reminding them to vaccinate, as well as texts/emails with links that allow them to complete posttest surveys at 3- and 9 months. Finally, we will prepare the intervention for the market that includes not only Planned Parenthood but other clinics that are currently served by the project partners as well as the broader market for HPV vaccination (Aim 3). In summary, the proposed communication strategy has wide reaching implications not only for reducing cancer risk, but more broadly for designing brief and easily implemented prevention messages across many domains of public health. The research will also close the health disparities gap in minority, underserved young adult women?s access to preventive health care."
"9128721","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The protein composition of synapses is exquisitely regulated to maintain healthy brain function. The synapse contains diverse set of centrally important transmembrane proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and ion channels. The precise architectural organization of these components establish postsynaptic function. The broad goal of this proposal is to understand how these critical postsynaptic proteins concentrate within excitatory synapses, and how regulation of their number and position contribute to mechanisms of neural plasticity in health and disease. Of particular importance is regulation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), because the number of activated AMPARs is controlled and modulated during many forms of neural plasticity. AMPARs diffuse freely on the neuronal surface membrane, and enter and exit the postsynaptic density (PSD) via this mechanism. In order to sustain synaptic strength, the synapse slows mobility of receptors to retain them. Unfortunately, despite intensive investigation, the mechanisms governing intrasynaptic receptor mobility remain unclear. Compelling data including high resolution imaging of receptor lateral movement suggest that binding to partners within the PSD, notably the scaffold PSD-95, is essential for receptor accumulation. However, numerical modeling and indirect experimental evidence suggest an alternative possibility, i.e. the synapse is so dense with proteins that this obstacle field prevens receptors from escaping. Nevertheless, this mechanism (intrasynaptic steric hindrance of receptors) is poorly understood and has not been systematically addressed. Motivated by these observations, I hypothesize that steric hindrance and biochemical binding in the PSD act in combination to regulate the mobility of synaptic transmembrane proteins like receptors. I have combined two single-molecule imaging approaches that permit discrimination of protein mobility within and around synapses with the necessary, nanometer-scale resolution. Using these approaches to monitor motion of a uniquely designed set of transmembrane protein probes will allow me to examine the influence of binding and steric hindrance separately. If the synaptic environment exerts steric influence on proteins entering the PSD, the effect should depend on protein size. The first set of experiments tests this prediction by altering the extracellular sizeof an otherwise identical binding-deficient transmembrane protein, and tracking their movements in the living synapse. I then assess whether steric hindrance in the extracellular and intracellular environment in the synapse could have different effects on receptor mobility, by altering the bulk size of the same protein on either side of the membrane and tracking their movements in the living synapse. The next experiments test the sufficiency of synaptic binding to slow transmembrane protein by following the movements of a small, generic transmembrane protein carrying a ligand which can bind to PSD- 95. These results greatly clarify important mechanisms controlling key proteins of the synapse."
"9190969","Project Summary/Abstract The pathogenesis of age-related idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and asbestosis is complex and incompletely understood, though accumulating evidence firmly implicates mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage that lead to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis as a key event in disease development. We previously showed that the extent of AEC mtDNA damage, mitochondrial aconitase (ACO-2) depletion and apoptosis are critical determinants of the fibrogenic potential of asbestos. Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is the major mitochondrial deacetylase and considered the ?guardian of the mitochondrial genome? through its role in regulating mitochondrial proteins that detoxify oxidative stress and preserve mtDNA via modulation of mitochondrial 8- oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and ACO-2 activities. Our preliminary studies in preparation for this proposal show that oxidative stress (asbestos or H2O2) decreases AEC SIRT3 protein expression; that SIRT3 silencing augments while SIRT3 enforced expression (EE) attenuates oxidant-induced AEC ACO-2 depletion, mtDNA damage, and apoptosis; that SIRT3 deficiency enhances asbestos- and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in association with increased AEC mtDNA damage; and that lungs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have increased acetylation of OGG1 and MnSOD. Taken together, these data suggest a novel role for SIRT3 in the maintenance of a healthy alveolar epithelium and prevention of fibrotic lung diseases. We hypothesize that honokiol, a small molecule SIRT3 inducer, attenuates oxidant-induced AEC mtDNA damage, mitochondrial ROS production, and apoptosis as well as pulmonary fibrosis in part by maintaining expression and activity of OGG1, ACO-2, and MnSOD. We have formulated two related aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will determine whether honokiol prevents oxidant-induced AEC mtDNA damage and intrinsic apoptosis in vitro via a SIRT3-dependent mechanism involving preservation of AEC mitochondrial protein (OGG1, ACO-2, MnSOD) function and reduction in protein acetylation and mitochondrial ROS. In Aim 2, we will use wild-type and Sirt3-/- mice to determine whether honokiol and resveratrol (another small molecule sirtuin inducer) mitigate pulmonary fibrosis (asbestos or bleomycin) in vivo by a SIRT3- dependent mechanism and whether protection is associated with reductions in alveolar epithelial type 2 cell (AT2) OGG1 and MnSOD acetylation, mtDNA damage, and apoptosis. These studies will elucidate the importance of honokiol-induced SIRT3-EE in preserving AT2 cell mtDNA integrity and preventing lung fibrosis which may have broad implications for the treatment of IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases."
"9243089","PROJECT SUMMARY Significant racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities exist in access to diagnostic and treatment services for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Because earlier access to ASD services improves long-term outcomes, delayed engagement with these services can be responsible for substantial morbidity. This pattern of health service break-down ? delay in care, leading to preventable morbidity ? exists in many sectors of the US health care system. One promising solution, which has been studied extensively over the past ten years, is patient navigation. Patient navigation is a lay-delivered case management strategy designed to reduce health disparities by helping vulnerable populations overcome psychological and logistical hurdles to care. Navigation has proven effectiveness in multiple disorders such as cancer and HIV, and early data support its use as a strategy to promote timely engagement with evidence-based services among children with ASD. However, despite navigation's substantial effectiveness data, multiple studies demonstrate the attenuation of its impact, and variable success, when implemented in real-world practice. This ?research-practice? gap ? whereby effective clinical innovations fail to be adopted (or practiced with appropriate fidelity) within real-world clinical practice ? is ubiquitous in healthcare; but it is particularly problematic for low-income and minority populations and the institutions that serve them. Furthermore, despite guidance to the contrary, few clinical trials proactively collect data on the complex patient, provider, and organizational factors that impact subsequent implementation of the clinical innovations being tested. As a result of this missed opportunity, implementation strategies are often arbitrary and prone to failure. Therefore, in this K23 application, I propose to use emerging techniques in the field of dissemination and implementation science to evaluate key implementation processes of patient navigation in the context of an ongoing, NIMH-funded, multi-site randomized controlled trial of a patient navigation system designed to improve access to care for low-income children with ASD (R01MH104355, Feinberg). The goal of this work is to elucidate factors that can increase the likelihood of rapid and sustained uptake of patient navigation in diverse, real-world practice settings. My educational objectives are to gain training and experience in dissemination and implementation science through the following goals: to learn process mapping and analysis; to learn new qualitative methods; and to learn and apply a new quantitative technique - multilevel modeling. The research in this proposal builds directly on my prior work, which focused on using multidisciplinary teams to improve access to services for children with ASD and their families. I have identified an experienced mentoring team and a supportive research environment, which will ensure that I attain my immediate and long-term goals. At the end of the award, I will be position to develop a testable data-driven implementation strategy to promote the rapid dissemination and implementation of patient navigation to vulnerable children with ASD.  "
"9353174","SUMMARY The primary goal of this project is to identify genetic modifiers of the PSEN1 mutation by studying a group of high risk PSEN1-G206A mutation carriers. If successful, we may be able to learn how these modifier variants may lower the risk of AD by delaying age at onset or slowing age-related memory decline. In 2001, we identified a founder mutation in PSEN1 (G206A) in family members from eight Caribbean Hispanic families with origins in Puerto Rico. The average age at onset with this mutation was unusually late (mean: 55.6 years) and was remarkably variable within as well as across families, ranging from 22-77 years. In this group of Puerto Rican families with multiple affected family members, this mutation is as prevalent as APOE ?4, but, unlike APOE ?4 carriers who have an increased risk of AD, most PSEN1 carriers will eventually develop Alzheimer disease (AD). To determine whether these PSEN1 mutation carrier families can be used to identify genetic modifiers, we performed a pilot whole exome sequencing (WES) study. Using 31 G206A carriers, we identified six candidate genes that may harbor variants that alter onset of AD in these families, and variants within these genes accounted for as much as 15-20 years differences in age at onset of AD [2]. We then observed that three out of six genes had SNPs that were associated with variable age at onset in individuals with late onset AD (LOAD), suggesting that these may be generalizable to LOAD, the most common form of AD. In the present study, we propose to perform state of the art whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify genetic modifiers of age at onset or memory performance, while capitalizing on this unique high risk group with a founder mutation. To date, we have recruited and examined 75 extended EOAD families that have one or more individuals who carry the PSEN1-G206A mutation. Most of these individuals have in-depth phenotype data as well as GWAS data. In addition, we will have access to independent sets of unrelated Caribbean Hispanics as well as non-Hispanic Whites to examine how clinically relevant these variants are in the general populations. The short-term goal of this study is to identify genetic variants that modify the age at onset and/or memory performance in PSEN1-G206A carriers, but the long-term goal is to identify a potential therapeutic target(s) that might delay or prevent AD."

"9201148","Since 2000, NIOSH has conducted a number of epidemiologic studies on respiratory and non-respiratory health in occupants of damp/moldy buildings, and collected more than 2,000 floor/chair dust samples which have been being stored in -80°C freezers. The existing database from those studies includes measurements on culturable fungi and bacteria, fungal cell wall components (ergosterol and glucan), and bacterial cell wall components (endotoxin and peptidoglycan) as well as occupants? health. Significant associations between various adverse respiratory and non-respiratory health effects and exposure to fungal biomarkers have been demonstrated. This project examines associations of exposure to mycotoxins with occupants? health by building the capability of analyzing indoor environmental samples for multiple mycotoxins in a single sample analysis. As part of a collaboration with a research group in Austria, approximately 530 floor dust samples are being analyzed and metabolites that are likely to have originated from fungi are being identified.  These samples were collected from multiple sources including elementary schools and an office building with a history of water damage. Potential sources of the funagal metabolites include Alternaria, Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Fusarium, Mycosphaerelia, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, and Phoma species. Surprisingly, 26 floor dust samples contained deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin; range=4 ? 72 pg/mg of dust) that can be released from Fusarium graminearum and other Fusarium species. To confirm their findings, NIOSH will compare the results to fungal DNA sequencing data. An experiment to assess optimal storage conditions for dust samples is currently under way. Baseline, and 2-week-, and 10-week-old samples that had been stored at three different temperatures (room temperature, fridge, and -80 freezer) have been analyzed. Samples stored for 6 months are currently being analyzed, and we will continue the storage analysis for up to 2 years to understand stability of the metabolites in samples stored in different temperature conditions."
"9071701","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the current budget period, the Adult Children Study (ACS) transitioned from cross-sectional to longitudinal analyses, many of which are ongoing. With this application, the ACS now incorporates new biomarkers to address the overarching hypothesis that disrupted neural integrity is the proximate cause of the transition from preclinica to symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD). Two corollary hypotheses will be addressed: 1) cerebral amyloidosis and tauopathy individually are necessary but insufficient to cause the transition from cognitive normality to impairment; and 2) the spread of tauopathy from the medial temporal lobe to the neocortex is the tau imaging correlate of the transition from preclinical to symptomatic AD. Predicting individual-level development of symptomatic AD will be enormously important for the field and may accelerate secondary prevention trials of anti-AD therapies by permitting the enrollment of only cognitively normal individuals who have near certainty of progressing to symptomatic AD. The ACS investigators and its cohort are uniquely qualified to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Recruit, enroll, and maintain the ACS cohort (N?300) 2. At entry and every 3 years thereafter comprehensively assess all participants with: 1) well-established clinical and cognitive instruments (annually for participants >65 years);  2) blood for genotyping for apolipoprotein E and other susceptibility genetic variants; 3) PET scans with amyloid and tau tracers (florbetapir and T807); 4) lumbar puncture (LP) for the collection of CSF; 5) an attentional battery; and 6) structural and functional MRI. 3. In ACS participants who transition from cognitive normality to impairment, correlate phenoconversion with: a. The regional distribution and density of tau retention (Project 1) b. CSF markers of neural (tau, p-tau181) and synaptic (SNAP-25, neurogranin) injury (Project 2) c. Longitudinal rates of change on measures of global cognition and episodic memory (Clinical Core, Project 1) and attentional control (Project 3), cross sectional event-related fMRI as a function of AD markers, and the relation among A?42, sleep, and memory consolidation mechanisms (Project 3) d. The regional distribution and density of amyloid retention, and changes in brain structure and function (hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, functional connectivity) (Project 4) e. CSF concentrations of A?42, and also novel analytes (YKL-40, VILIP 1) (Project 2) 4. Analyze associations among rates of change of all AD markers from all Cores and Projects (Data Management and Biostatistics Core)."
"9165593","ABSTRACT AND PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that drive cellular processes within the complexity of biological systems remains a formidable task. Addressing this challenge requires the development of new technologies that not only increase the number of analytes that can be measured in a single experiment, but also link measurements across multiple parameters to reveal insights into mechanism. Here, I build upon a spectral encoding platform we have recently developed to create two such technologies that will dramatically boost the information content of high-throughput measurements by increasing their dimensionality. First, I will combine tools from microfluidics, electrical engineering, and chemistry to enable code-directed synthesis of programmable peptide libraries directly on spectrally encoded beads. By using the code embedded within each bead to direct the chemical synthesis of a specific peptide on its surface, this scheme simultaneously increases potential library size while dramatically lowering synthesis costs. In addition, peptides of interest in downstream assays can be identified via imaging alone, increasing ease of readout. As a first biological application, I will create libraries to probe proteolytic signatures that correlate with disease, with the goal of identifying peptide sequences that can be used in the future as diagnostic and imaging probes. In future applications, these programmable, proteome-scale libraries would facilitate a wide range of additional applications that include enzyme-substrate profiling (e.g. kinases, phosphatases, proteases), immune repertoire profiling, and protein-protein interaction screening. Second, I will probe both the causes and effects of cellular heterogeneity by developing a new assay that enables the measurement of both transcriptome and phenotype for many single cells in parallel. Here, spectrally encoded beads with unique oligonucleotide barcodes conjugated to their surface provide the critical link, allowing sequencing reads measuring transcript levels to be traced back not only to a single cell, but to a particular single cell that has already been characterized phenotypically. As a proof of principle, I will use the assay to measure levels of 40 secreted proteins and hundreds of transcripts for > 1000 cells, with the goal of understanding whether functional diversity in secreted protein profiles is transcriptionally encoded. In future work, this same scheme could be used to probe the molecular drivers of heterogeneity for a wide number of additional phenotypes, including intracellular and secreted protein levels, motility, cytotoxicity, morphology, and proliferation. Such assays would have tremendous biological and translational applications, from understanding how genetically identical immune cells clonally expand to yield diverse functional phenotypes to investigating the mechanisms that drive stem cell differentiation.  "
"9081121","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ability to see in the natural world depends on neural representations of objects. Signals sent from the eye to the brain are the basis for what we see, but these signals are transformed at many later stages of vision in order to perceive objects. The focus of this research is mid-level vision, a critical intermediate stage after the image-based representation of light in the eye but before knowledge-based object recognition. It is the first stage of representation for edges of surfaces, separation of surfaces from each other,  and figure-ground segregation. Mid-level vision includes vital processes for object perception but is studied relatively little.  Mid-level representations must solve two basic problems. First, they must integrate spatially separated parts of the scene selectively. Not all parts of a scene should be integrated into the representation for each distinct object, of course, so the selectivit is essential. Though normally effortless, the ability to integrate information from separate visual  regions is made salient by perceptual deficits in some cases of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Second, the information available to be integrated is often ambiguous. Normally the implicit ambiguity is resolved without conscious awareness, though images that fluctuate between two different bi-stable percepts are textbook examples demonstrating neural ambiguity. The research here links these two challenges for mid-level vision by determining how spatially separated ambiguous representations become grouped together.  This work requires the ability (1) to experimentally create and control ambiguity in separate mid-level representations localized for distinct regions of visual space and (2) to quantify how each of the separate ambiguous representations is perceived. Both are achieved using an innovative technique called chromatic interocular switch rivalry, which generates ambiguous representations for color at a level beyond monocular stages of visual processing (beyond monocular representations in cortical area V1). Chromatic ambiguity provides a model neural representation for understanding grouping of mid-level ambiguity.  Experiments will test how separated ambiguous representations are grouped and resolved. Initial hypothesis tests will determine the temporal and spatial characteristics, motion and three-dimensional percepts that cause mid-level ambiguities in separate areas to become grouped. Further studies will test whether the range covered by the ambiguity itself mediates the grouping that serves to resolve it. Other experiments will extend the research to fully rendered three-dimensional objects to test whether resolution of ambiguity by grouping follows from color-constant surface percepts that discount illumination. In sum, this research will discover new knowledge about ambiguous mid-level representations, delivering an important advance for understanding normal vision as well as visual impairments."
"9148079","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncovering the principles behind the generation of voluntary movements is a necessary first step in the development of technologies and treatments aimed at restoring motor abilities lost to neurological disease or trauma. The aim of this project is to shed light on the neural mechanisms of voluntary movement initiation. An essential component of voluntary movement is the choice of when to act. Under normal circumstances this decision can be time consuming usually taking up to a few hundreds of milliseconds, longer that the known delays in the nervous system. The area of the brain most associated with generating movements, the motor cortex, becomes very active just before and during the movement, however what exactly is happening during this time is still not well understood. Indeed, while much is known about the neural basis of generating movements, several open questions remain: does a movement generated deliberately with no time pressure, like a reach made to grab an object from a table, share the same neural underpinnings with a very fast reach to catch a falling object? Will the motor cortex be just as active before a quasi-automatic reach when time is of the essence? Or is pre-movement activity only present when there is enough time to deliberately plan the movement? During movement itself, is motor cortex involved in generating quasi-automatic reaches or is there is some reflex mechanism that bypasses motor cortex to generate urgent reaches? To begin answering these questions we have trained two monkeys to initiate a reach under three very different circumstances: sometimes monkeys move at a time of their own choosing with no imposed time constraints, other times monkeys must intercept a rapidly moving target on a screen, which elicits very short-latency reaches. In yet another set of trials monkeys must withhold a reach until given a go cue. The first aim of this project is to determine if these three movements (self-initiated, quasi-automatic and cue-initiated) share a common neural mechanism that does not depend on how the movement is initiated. To do this we will record the responses from a number of neurons in two key regions of the motor cortex: the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex. In order to understand and interpret these responses, we will employ cutting edge machine learning techniques that will allow us to visualize and quantify the how neural activity evolves in  time. Being able to visualize the evolution of neural activity is a key component in understanding the principles that govern how the neural activity translates to movement. The second aim of this project is to elucidate the role that higher cortical areas play in the generation of voluntar movements. We will record neural activity from areas upstream of motor cortex (supplementary motor area), which is heavily interconnected with the motor cortex and is suspected to play crucial a role in determining when a movement should be initiated. We will test record neural activity from this area and characterize its properties using the same cutting edge techniques developed in the first part of this project."
"9270780","ABSTRACT The goal of this work is to evaluate the individual-level effectiveness and potential population-level impact of decentralized anti-retroviral therapy programs (DTP) and enhanced social capital to achieve sustained HIV viral suppression among female sex workers (FSW) living with HIV in South Africa. FSW have been shown to bear disproportionate burden of HIV across Southern Africa and to be at high risk of onward HIV transmission given disparities in access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART). These data are consistent across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and highlight an urgent need to minimize disparities in treatment access for FSW living with HIV, and interrupt these large chains of transmission with better uptake and retention in ART programs. The proposed study will first characterize optimal implementation methods for interventions that address underlying barriers to sustained viral suppression through qualitative interviews with key informants, benefactors, and the government. The crux of the proposed aims are to describe the effectiveness and durability of decentralized treatment programs and case management interventions to achieve sustained viral suppression using adaptive implementation strategies tested through a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART). The SMART will randomize 782 non-virally suppressed FSW living with HIV in Durban, South Africa to one of two experimental conditions including access to decentralized treatment programs (DTP) or DTP and case management interventions and will follow the participants for 18 months, through multiple randomization assignments. Not all FSW will benefit from - or need - the same intervention or intensity to achieve sustained viral suppression. Indeed, it would not be feasible to implement these interventions for all people living with HVI as neither represent current standard of care. However, the adaptive implementation strategies proposed here provide a platform to evaluate multicomponent, graduated, intervention intensity to achieve sustained viral suppression. Finally, we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the varying packages of interventions to measure sustainability and scalability of these approaches. The research will be conducted by Johns Hopkins University, in partnership with the TB/HIV Care Association (THCA) and the University of Toronto. We will utilize existing infrastructure and service delivery systems run by THCA in Durban to recruit FSW living with HIV to participate in the trial. Furthermore, health assessment data routinely collected by THCA and the National Health Laboratory Service will be used, in addition to data collected by the study team, to assess treatment outcomes and viral suppression among these women. The study represents an approach to characterize effective strategies to improve HIV treatment outcomes for a population disproportionately burdened by HIV, and leverage these data to model the cost-effectiveness in the context of the generalized HIV epidemic found in South Africa. This study is in line with the new NIH high priorities in terms of describing optimal approaches to ensure retention in ART and also minimizing disparities."
"9117235","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):This Strategic Alliance seeks funding to develop an immunotherapeutic intervention for prescription opioid abuse that combines a lead oxycodone vaccine with immunomodulators formulated through a novel thermosensitive gelling polymer technology to enhance the post-vaccination antibody (Ab) response. Vaccines for substance use disorders (SUD) have the potential to be a long-lasting, safe, cheap, and effective intervention. Vaccines for SUD stimulate the patient's own immune system to produce anti-drug Ab that prevent drug distribution to the brain and drug-induced behavior. First-generation SUD vaccines did not meet expectations, yet demonstrated proof-of-principle in the subset of immunized subjects that achieved high levels of anti-drug serum Ab. Generation of Ab results from T cell-dependent B cell differentiation in germinal centers (GC) in secondary lymphoid organs. GC-dependent antigen-specific B and T cell differentiation is regulated by specific signaling pathways controlled by cytokines (e.g., interleukins), co- stimulatory molecules, and immune checkpoints. A wealth of pre-clinical studies have tested whether the efficacy of SUD vaccines can be improved by hapten and bioconjugation chemistry, adjuvant, peptides and protein carriers, liposome-protein nanoparticle, or polymer-based nanoparticles. In contrast, no studies have tested the broad range of available immunomodulators, which have revolutionized immunotherapy for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Using the model vaccine 6OXY-KLH, our group has identified immunological mechanisms underlying post-vaccination Ab and vaccine efficacy, and we are currently exploiting these targets for developing more effective SUD vaccines. In a screening study to identify potential lead immunomodulators, we found that co-administration of 6OXY-KLH with IL-4, or a monoclonal Ab (mAb) that blocks IL-2 signaling, increased efficacy against oxycodone. To effectively combine the 6OXY-KLH with IL-4 and/or other immunomodulators in a suitable injectable formulation, we have partnered with i-novion, a start-up company specialized in polymer technology, which has exclusive ownership of novel pentablock co-polymers (PBC). AIM1 will test whether combination of 6OXY-KLH and selected immunomodulators improves post-vaccination anti-oxycodone Ab, 6OXY-specific B cells, and vaccine efficacy in mice. AIM2 will test whether PBC-assisted delivery improves efficacy of 6OXY-KLH and leads from AIM1. AIM3 will test the efficacy of leads from AIM1 and AIM2, in blocking oxycodone-induced striatal dopamine release and conditioned place preference in mice, and oxycodone i.v. self-administration in rats. Completion of these aims will generate an immunotherapeutic intervention for prescription opioid abuse, ready for cGMP production and IND enabling studies. Completion of this project will provide data supporting a novel mechanism-based strategy for enhancing post-vaccination Ab responses, which could be applied to vaccines for other SUD or challenging diseases such as HIV, malaria, or cancer."

"9161134","Project Abstract Recent studies have highlighted the very low efficiency (<10%) of reproducibility for research on drug targets transferred from academia to pharma target discovery. It is also well known that many failures across the drug development pipeline can be traced to inadequate drug target selection and validation. A striking case in point is the recent cluster of high-profile clinical trial failures in Alzheimer Disease (AD). In this case, a significant question now being asked is: was the common understanding of what was the ?right target? actually correct? This in turn has led to an intensified search for new targets. While the robustness and reproducibility problem is highlighted in AD research, it extends across many areas of translational research in biomedicine and ultimately has a great impact on both healthcare costs and productivity of research. We believe it is possible to improve reproducibility and robustness by improving the fidelity and computational tractability with which research results are represented. This project will build and test advanced informatics methods for improving the reproducibility of biomedical research - by creating software to build, analyze and apply structured ?standoff? metadata in the form of argument graphs (knowledge graphs, micropublications) across the assertions made and evidence presented in the biomedical literature and data archives. This metadata will be integrated with existing biomedical ontologies and serialized as linked data in RDF. Our objective in this project is to enable computational processing and reasoning over the details of claims, counterclaims, evidence and counter-evidence bearing upon specific areas - biological processes, mechanisms of drug action, etc. - required to be validated and understood in academic and pharmaceutical drug research and development. This project aims to demonstrate and explore feasibility of this approach. Our software will enable construction of (1) Highly specialized argument graphs as target validation criteria templates against which claims and evidence for pharmaceutical target advancement may be evaluated. (2) Libraries of graph metadata which can be assembled across entire areas of research, or applied one by one to individual articles. We will specifically target this project to Alzheimer Disease (AD). As part of our project we will develop a and publish corpus of detailed argument - claims - evidence graph metadata on the most influential articles in AD research covering the past 5-10 years. This is an area of great scientific and medical need, with many recent failures in clinical trials, no effective cures, a glaring need for new validated drug targets, and annual U.S. healthcare costs on the order of $220 million per year."

"9270212","Project Summary/Abstract:  Adults with HIV are at increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic complications compared to HIV-uninfected control populations. Compared to what is known in adults, little is known about these risks in the pediatric population and even less in the setting of sub-Saharan Africa. Although inflammation has been linked to cardiovascular disease in adults with HIV, the role of inflammation on markers of cardiovascular disease risk has been scarcely investigated in HIV-infected children and adolescents. Furthermore, the impact of non-AIDS co morbidities may be greater in sub-Saharan Africa, though no studies of CVD have been conducted in children on ART in this setting.  The overall objective of this proposed K23 research plan is to use surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease to identify HIV-infected children and youth at risk of early heart disease and to understand the mechanisms of these changes, so that risk- reduction therapies can be appropriately targeted and novel preventive strategies may be developed in the future. In a longitudinal study of 100 HIV-infected youth and 100 healthy controls, this project aims to use carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and insulin resistance to identify early cardiometabolic risks in HIV- infected youth compared to age and gender match HIV uninfected controls in Kampala, Uganda. Additionally, we will investigate whether these makers of cardiometabolic disease correlate with biomarkers of inflammation and gut integrity. This study will provide a comprehensive view of how inflammation, immune activation and bacterial translocation relate to cardiometabolic disease among HIV-infected children and adolescents.  The PI, Dr Dirajlal-Fargo, is an exceptional candidate who is seeking to become an internationally recognized clinician-investigator in the field of cardiometabolic complications in pediatric HIV. She also has experience conducting clinical research in Uganda.  Dr Dirajlal-Fargo has strong institutional support from Case Western Reserve University and the Department of Pediatrics at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital. She will have guaranteed 75% protected research time and access to a wealth of resources that will ensure a successful transition to independently funded investigator. Her robust training plan includes: 1)high quality mentorship from her primary mentor, Dr Grace McComsey, as well as co-mentors in the field of immunology, infectious disease and cardiovascular complications of HIV and pediatric HIV in Uganda, a biostatistician and a group of collaborators; 2) coursework in fundamental immunology with a focus on chronic HIV infection; 3) training in cardiovascular imaging and physiology; 4) training in clinical research design and statistics; 5) experience in international interdisciplinary team science; and 6) field experience in integrating clinical care and research programs."
"9256048","Abstract  Progress in the development of clinical cell transplantation therapy for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) has been hindered due to the lack of patient-specific, inexhaustible human pancreatic ?-islets that are immuno-evasive. Recent advances in stem cell differentiation have demonstrated the utility of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as a valid cell source to produce patient-specific, renewable human pancreatic ?-islets that are competent for glucose-responsive insulin secretion. However, current technologies do not support scalable expansion and differentiation of hiPSCs for the production of high-quality human pancreatic ?-islets in large quantities to meet clinical demands. The overall goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop enabling technologies for the mass production of hiPSC-derived functional pancreatic ?-islet like cell clusters (ILCs) for T1D cell therapy through quick and serial expansion during the pancreatic differentiation process. Using a thin wire array-base cell aggregate cutter, hiPSC-derived cell aggregates at certain stage (to be determined in the project) will be reduced to uniform-sized smaller aggregates which will continue to grow in culture. After serial expansions, the cell aggregates will proceed along their pancreatic differentiation pathway to ?-ILCs. Once the scalable expansion platform is developed, we will characterize the biochemical profile and in vitro functionalities of the resultant ?-ILCs. Our overall hypothesis is that stage-specific rapid and serial expansion of hiPSC-derived cell aggregates during their stepwise pancreatic differentiation will not adversely affect their downstream pancreatic differentiation into pancreatic ?-ILCs, and the functionalities of the resultant hiPSC-EB- ILCs. The work is expected to develop enabling technologies to overcome human pancreatic ??-cell shortages, representing key advances toward clinically applicable T1D cell therapy that possesses immense commercial potential."

We have a large and productive Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) that hosts one of the largest Clinical Research Centers (CRC) in the country. Our CTSA includes a cohort of outstanding clinicians and physician scientists whose diagnostic and research skills are broad and deep. We will combine established Vanderbilt resources including the StarPanel electronic medical record (EMR), the REDCap database system, and the BioVU DNA databank with other Vanderbilt assets to create the VCUD. The VCUD will provide the right team to make the right diagnosis for a UD patient the first time. We will then use Vanderbilt VICTR Studios and the Mass Spectrometry Research Center to discover new diseases and promote translational research that leads to new treatments. We will also test for genetic variations that we find in UD candidate genes in the >13,000, soon to be >40,000 exomes in our BioVU system that links de-identified EMRs to DNA samples from >166,000 Vanderbilt patients. Our BioVU cohort will also allow us to identify patients with phenotypic similarities to each UD, as well as, the Rare Diseases (RD) and New Diseases (ND) that may be included in a specific UD. We will then use the BioVU data and DNAs to determine the contribution of notable allelic variants found in VCUD patients to more general phenotypes that may be more common.  We have experience with and a passion to diagnose, treat and care for UD patients at Vanderbilt and we look forward to creating a VCUD that brings hope and resolution to desperate situations and fosters synergistic collaboration with the UDN. The VCUD will contribute to the UDN by becoming a clinical arm of the Human Genome Project that efficiently screens, invites, evaluates, diagnoses, counsels and assists UD patients and their physicians in maximizing the quality of their lives. To develop the VCUD we will use unique resources at Vanderbilt that will efficiently diagnose UD patients of all ages and foster development of the UDN by the following Specific Aims: 1) Improve the diagnosis and care of pediatric and adult UD patients using the right VCUD team to make the right diagnosis the first time using ResearchMatch, StarPanel and REDCap; 2) Determine the etiology of UD by collecting and sharing data with the UDN; and determine the pathophysiology, and develop better diagnostic and treatment options, including clinical trials by using VICTR Studios to focus multiple Vanderbilt resources on UD; and 3) Use the Vanderbilt Mass Spectrometry Research Center, BioVU repository and VANGARD to discover, characterize and determine the contributions of both new diseases and atypical presentations of rare diseases to the Undiagnosed Diseases that affect many patients."
"9203358","Aging is associated with dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity, which impairs an individual's ability to control infection by newly encountered pathogens. Aging also impacts neuroprotective mechanisms within the central nervous system (CNS), including the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the entry and replication of neutrotropic viruses. West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of arthropod-transmitted viral infections in the United States. While most WNV infections are asymptomatic, individuals with symptomatic disease present either with a flu-like febrile illness that can progress to severe neuroinvasive diseases including meningitis, encephalitis, or flaccid paralysis. Severe WNV infection, especially fatal forms, predominate in the elderly. It is unclear whether this is due to effects of aging on viral invasion and/or virologic control within peripheral tissues or the CNS. To study many different aspects of immune regulation in adult mice, the Diamond and Klein laboratories have established a murine model of infection with a virulent WNV strain. However, interactions between antiviral immunity, neuroinflammation, and aging within the CNS have not been investigated. In this proposal, we will examine the impact of age on innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that control viral entry and clearance specifically within the CNS. The UH2 phase we will establish breeding cohorts and determine the feasibility of using 21 month-old aged animals in WNV infection studies. In the UH3 phase, we will explore how changes in skin immunity, BBB integrity, and CNS inflammation during aging influence neuroinvasion and disease progression associated with WNV infection. "
"8949083","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In vitro differentiation of cultured human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) constitutes a promising tool for the generation of specific cell types useful for cell replacement therapies. Despite rapid progress over the last decade, numerous challenges encompassing cell-production quantity, quality and safety remain to be addressed before full-fledged clinical application becomes a reality. Moreover, generation of functional organs from hPSCs, a possible alternative to meet the rising demands for organ donors, remains, to date, improbable. Overall, these shortcomings are due to our limited understanding of molecular and genetic events underlying in vivo tissue/organ generation. Throughout evolution, nature has evolved a sophisticated and robust intrinsic genetic program that works seamlessly with extrinsic developmental niches in a choreographed spatiotemporal manner to enable embryonic cells to commit to specific cell lineages and be organized into higher-order tissue architectures. Blastocyst complementation is based on emptying these developmental niches by altering the expression of gene(s) critical for a specific cell/tissue type and use donor  chimeric-competent PSCs to colonize the vacant niche and allow for the generation of tissues/organs of donor origin. With the advent of CRISPR/CAS9-mediated genome engineering technologies, gene knockout animals can be generated with high efficiency by co-injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs directly into zygotes. Concurrently, chimeric- competent/naïve hPSCs have seen several promising developments. By combining the strength of zygote genome editing and chimeric-competent/naïve hPSCs, this proposal seeks to establish a novel interspecific blastocyst complementation system for the generation of functional human organs in a large animal host, the pig. This offers an attractive platform for realizing hPSCs' full potenial towards generating clinically relevant cells/tissues/organs. If successful, this approac"
"9230021","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose here our overall plan for the Health Promotion Research Center (HPRC) at the University of Washington for the next five years. One of the original three Prevention Research Centers funded by CDC in 1986, HPRC focuses on promoting healthy aging and reducing health disparities among adults aged 50 and older. Building on our 15 years of experience conducting dissemination and implementation research aimed at scale-up of effective interventions, we plan to focus our work in three areas: cancer prevention and control, mental and physical health of older adults, and workplace health promotion.  Specifically, we will expand the national reach of three flagship healthy-aging programs that were developed and tested by HPRC and disseminated by community organizations partnering with HPRC. First is EnhanceFitness, a group-exercise program for older adults. Since 1999, Senior Services, a Seattle-based non- profit organization serving older adults, has disseminated EnhanceFitness to more than 500 community sites in more than 30 states. It has reached more than 25,000 older adults, most of whom are low-income or members of racial and ethnic minorities. Second is PEARLS, a depression-management program delivered in community settings. Since 2003, Area Agencies on Aging have delivered PEARLS to more than 2,000 low-income, largely fragile and home-bound older adults with depression, through 45 sites in 14 states. Third is Workplace Solutions, a package of evidence-based cancer prevention practices for the workplace. Since 2003, the American Cancer Society has disseminated Workplace Solutions to more than 1,600 workplaces with 6.9 million employees in 42 states.  Scale-up of the EnhanceFitness program, with a focus on reducing race/ethnicity-related disparities in arthritis suffering, will be the objective of our Core Researh Project. In 2011, Senior Services licensed EnhanceFitness to YMCA of the USA (Y-USA), the national-network office for more than 2,700 YMCAs. Because EnhanceFitness decreases pain and increases mobility for persons with arthritis, Y-USA will focus its EnhanceFitness implementation on the half of older adults who suffer from arthritis. Older adults are much more likely to participate in a community-based program like EnhanceFitness if it is recommended by a health care provider, so Y-USA has asked for HPRC's help in enhancing its current, limited approach to increasing provider recommendations for EnhanceFitness participation. To do so, we will first conduct formative research with pharmacists and physical therapists to learn the most effective means of increasing recommendations to a community-based program like EnhanceFitness. Second, we will develop an enhanced approach tailored to obtaining recommendations by pharmacists, physical therapists, and primary-care providers for participation of older-adult arthritis patients in EnhanceFitness at YMCAs. Third, we will conduct a cluster-randomized trial to compare the effectiveness and the cost of the current and enhanced approaches."
"9236303","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has created an unprecedented opportunity for women with criminal justice involvement (CJI) to obtain health insurance coverage, primarily through Medicaid expansion in 32 states and the District of Columbia. The vast majority (77%) of women with CJI are on probation. The proposed study will investigate healthcare utilization among women on probation who have Medicaid, focusing on health literacy and other factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of care. Women with CJI are disproportionately low-income women of color who are strongly affected by health disparities, with much higher burdens of preventable and chronic health conditions than women without CJI. In addition to practical, social, and economic factors, the Institute of Medicine recognizes that poor health literacy is a major barrier to the use of preventive and routine care among disadvantaged populations. Poor health literacy is associated with lower likelihood of receiving preventive care and poorer outcomes for chronic health conditions. It also contributes to overuse of urgent and emergency care. Guided by the Health Literacy Skills Framework and the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, our research aims are as follows:  Aim 1: To identify health literacy and other enabling, impeding, and need factors that influence type (e.g., urgent, routine) and venue (e.g., emergency department, community clinic) of healthcare utilization in a cohort (n=360) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 2: To explore how criminal justice involvement, health literacy, and prior experiences navigating healthcare settings contextualize type and venue of healthcare utilization among a qualitative subsample (n=80) of women on probation who have Medicaid.  Aim 3: To use findings from Aims 1 and 2 to adapt an existing health literacy intervention designed for women with CJI, pilot the intervention with women on probation who have Medicaid (n=40), and assess its feasibility and acceptability for a larger efficacy study. The ultimate goal of the intervention would be to shift patterns of Medicaid utilization toward routine and preventive healthcare in community settings.  The proposed study is responsive to PAR-10-133 in its investigation of the influence of health literacy on a behavioral outcome (healthcare utilization) and the development of an intervention to address the specific health literacy needs of a vulnerable population. For women on probation, Medicaid utilization for preventive and routine health care may require specific, focused health literacy education and support. Knowledge from the proposed study will contribute to scholarship on the underlying causes of health disparities among women with CJI, the impact of Medicaid expansion under the ACA, and strategies to improve women?s health by increasing routine and preventive healthcare utilization."
"9026459","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Shared Decision Making to Improve Palliative Care in the Nursing Home Abstract Twenty-eight percent of Americans over the age of 65 die in a nursing home. Research has found the quality of care of end-of-life care in nursing homes to have many challenges. It has also been documented that family members, especially those living at a distance, want to be involved in the care of their resident and family support can be beneficial to residents. Family members' involvement in decision-making in the nursing home setting improves outcomes for residents with life-limiting illnesses. Shared decision-making is a process wherein a healthcare choice is jointly made by a healthcare provider and a resident or resident's proxy (14, 15), often a family member. This proposal seeks to facilitate SDM among family members, residents with life- limiting illnesses (who are not enrolled in hospice), and the nursing home care team. Our overall research question (RQ) asks: To what extent are outcomes for family member and residents with life limiting illnesses associated with SDM via web-conferencing in the nursing home? Our overall hypothesis (H) is that SDM among family members, residents (when possible), and skilled nursing home staff via web- conferencing will improve outcomes for family members and residents with life-limiting illnesses. We propose exploratory mixed methods randomized clinical trial pilot to test the effect of shared decision making using web-based conferencing on the depression and burden of family members and the pain of nursing home residents. We seek to translate our hospice experience with web-conferencing and shared decision making into the nursing home setting with geriatric residents appropriate for palliative care."
"9116489","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite significant advances in the treatment of patients harboring GBM, there have been modest increases in overall survivals, on the order of 1 month for every decade of research. While the EORTC-NCIC trial by Hegi et al (13) implicated the status of MGMT promoter methylation as a biomarker of GBM patient response to Temozolomide (TMZ), all GBM patients continue to be treated with TMZ, regardless of their MGMT status (13). The lack of enthusiasm to systematically use MGMT promoter methylation to guide treatment is due to: 1) lack of other therapeutic options; 2) 50% of patients with methylated MGMT promoter (a good prognostic factor) do not survive 2 years; and, 3) 15% of patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter (bad prognosis) survived 2 years. Moreover, MGMT methylation status is associated with improved outcome both in the TMZ-based chemoradiation and radiation-only arms. All of these observations suggest that MGMT promoter methylation status may be partly a prognostic marker associated with the nature of the tumor, rather than a truly therapy- specific predictive marker. Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in cellular ATP generation. We previously demonstrated that CcO plays a central role in acquired resistance to TMZ. Importantly, in a retrospective trial, we showed that CcO activity was inversely correlated with clinical outcomes. The long term goal is to identify robust and clinically relevant molecular markers that can add value to classical clinicl prognostic factors in order to tailor medical treatment to individual tumor characteristics and to design better clinical trials for new drugs against gliomas. The objective of the proposed biomarker clinical trial is to determine whether CcO activity represents a novel and valuable prognostic biomarker for patients receiving standard of care therapy. Our hypothesis is that high tumor CcO activity is associated with poor outcomes independently of MGMT promoter methylation status. Additionally, we hypothesize that MGMT promoter methylation status is a true predictive biomarker of how patients will respond to standard of care TMZ-based chemoradiation in tumors with low CcO activity. This will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) determine overall and progression-free survival times relative to CcO activity; 2) compare the prognostic value of CcO activity to other commonly used prognostic markers. The approaches are innovative because we will validate activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, CcO, as a strong prognostic biomarker for primary GBM. Moreover, clinical trial designs based on CcO activity and MGMT promoter methylation stratification have tremendous potential to optimize and individualize therapy by prospectively identifying those patients who will benefit most from TMZ standard therapy and those who will not. This proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the application of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers for GBM patients in order to tailor medical treatment based on individual tumor characteristics and to design better clinical trials for new drugs leading to personalized therapy for GBM patients."
"9146896","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health diagnoses are common in pediatric practice. Abundant evidence demonstrates that many medications used to treat children with mental health conditions are prescribed in circumstances or combinations for which they are not recommended. Such use may lead to patient harms such as onset of diabetes or suicidal ideation, and potentially avoidable emergency department visits and hospitalizations. This project proposes (1) to describe in detail the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings, focusing on medication safety in children with mental health diagnoses who are enrolled in New York State Medicaid ; (2) to assess the extent to which three strategies: a) receipt of primary care in a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)-recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH); b) a new state policy (carve-in) that assigns responsibility to manage the prescription pharmaceutical insurance benefit to managed care plans rather than the state Medicaid program; and c) a more patient-centered, comprehensive set of medication reconciliation (med rec) practices can reduce potentially dangerous medication use or undesirable consequences / patient harms in this populations; and (3) to assess whether or not a state Department of Health quality department's implementation of a survey to assess medication reconciliation in practices throughout Medicaid is an effective way to enhance the performance of such practices. The epidemiological study will use cross sectional, univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses for each year from 2014 to 2017, including logistic regression and regression risk analysis. It will look at clinical, patient, contextual, and practice characteristics that are associated with lower and higher uses of potentially dangerous medication practices and undesirable outcomes. It will describe identified disparities, considering characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, rural/urban residence, foster care status, and level of poverty in the home county. A propensity score analysis will help to assess the association of the specified medication practices with undesirable outcomes and patient harm. Assessment of the PCMH and med rec strategies will utilize propensity score analyses that are modified from the models developed during the epidemiological analysis. The state carve-in policy, implemented in late 2011, will be assessed using a segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series from 2008 to 2016.=Medication reconciliation practice will be assessed using a survey instrument developed by an AHRQ- CMS CHIPRA Center of Excellence in the federal Pediatric Quality Measures Program. The impact of measurement on med rec practices will be assessed using a cluster randomized trial with a stepped wedge design, surveying one third of practices in all years, on third in years two and three and one thir in year three only. This project promises to provide more detailed insight both into an important patient safety risk in ambulatory settings for a vulnerable population and also into how well several strategies reduce risk in real world settings."
"9260558","Project Summary/Abstract The standard therapy for malignant primary bone tumors such as osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma involves major surgeries. For tumors located in difficult regions such as the pelvis, surgical intervention could lead to serious side effects. These include loss of a limb and/or function, loss of bowel, bladder and sexual function as well as problems with wound healing and surgical complications. Therefore, exploring other approaches that can improve or complement current surgical techniques is important. Our long term goal is to find new ways to increase the efficacy of treatment for primary bone tumors. Radiation therapy is an excellent local control alternative but primary bone tumors are resistant except for Ewing?s sarcoma. Preliminary work in our laboratory shows that small molecule DNA repair inhibitors are effective at radiosensitizing primary bone tumor cells. Additionally, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are shown to enhance radiosensitivity by increasing the physical local dose of radiation inside tumors. While these separate observations are well known in the literature, there appears to be lack of studies that combine these two agents to investigate whether their combination leads to synergistic radiosensitization. Also, the underlying mechanism of how this strategy might work remains to be studied. Our central hypothesis is that combination of DNA repair inhibition and AuNPs provides synergistic sensitizing effects through independent mechanisms with AuNPs increasing levels of damage induction and DNA repair inhibitor preventing repair. In Aim 1, we will investigate the efficacy of combining a DNA repair inhibitor with AuNPs to radiosensitize primary bone tumors. We will perform both in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the effects of the combination therapy. In Aim 2, we will investigate the DNA damage response activated when combining radiation therapy with a DNA repair inhibitor and AuNPs. We will explore the levels of key effectors activated in response to the DNA damage caused by the combination therapy and examine downstream effects on DNA repair, cell cycle and apoptosis. The results of this study will pave the way for the treatment of primary bone tumors with radiation therapy. This will lead to a new approach that could complement surgery and improve survival and quality of life. Our finding could also lead to new scientific insight regarding the mechanism of action for a combination radiosensitization strategy that uses both a biological and physical approach."
"9197818","The effects of drinking alcohol within recommended limits on risks of CVD, diabetes, and related diseases are perhaps the most important questions yet to be answered in the fields of alcohol, nutrition, or prevention. Approximately half of all adults worldwide report current or former alcohol consumption, and the benefits or risks that alcohol poses to their health urgently need clarification. Epidemiological studies have consistently found that alcohol intake within recommended limits is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes, yet no long-term randomized trial of alcohol consumption on risk of any chronic disease has yet been performed. In direct response to PAR-16-363 (Multi-Site Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Research Center on Alcohol's Health Effects), we propose together with several other research groups to perform a worldwide, six-year, balanced-design randomized trial, comparing the effects of one standard serving (~14 grams) of alcohol intake daily to abstention on risk of CVD, diabetes, mortality, and related outcomes among 7,800 adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide. To maximize feasibility and reflect actual use most closely, we propose to test alcohol consumption per se to abstention and thus to offer participants flexibility in their choice of beverage, while employing novel and intensive yet efficient methods to monitor safety. The Primary Specific Aim of this trial is to determine the effects of 14 gm of alcohol intake daily compared with abstention on risk of major cardiovascular events or death (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalized angina, need for revascularization, or death) over an average of 6 years of follow-up among 7,800 adults aged ?50 years with estimated 10-year CVD risk ?15% or prevalent CVD >6 months prior to enrollment. Secondary Aims will test the effects of alcohol on risks of incident diabetes and major cardiovascular events. Tertiary Aims will test risks of hard cardiovascular events and progression to impaired fasting glucose. Similar to other large randomized trials, we will establish ~16 centers worldwide using a stepped approach, with a 9-month vanguard phase among 7 centers in the US, Europe, Africa, and South America (in this application), followed by a second wave of additional sites to complete enrollment. Participants will be monitored for safety in multiple complementary ways, including brief electronic real-time reporting and validated yearly instruments and laboratory measures. These centers bring together highly successful groups in the US and Europe to establish clinical, data, and biospecimen coordinating centers, our field centers include many of the most experienced clinical trialists anywhere, and our group has strong working relationships with NIAAA and other NIH staff necessary to ensure seamless collaboration during a U10-funded cooperative research endeavor. In this application, we propose the first randomized clinical trial of alcohol consumption, aiming to determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of CVD and diabetes among adults at above-average cardiovascular risk worldwide."
"9151816","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ambulatory medication error can be a lethal problem in children with chronic conditions; overdoses can be fatal and chronic under-doses (non-adherence) lead to serious injury. One in four children has a chronic condition and one in five takes a daily medication. While it is known that children with chronic conditions take only half of their medications, the amount of non-adherence which is caused by error has not been studied in any population. Ambulatory children are particularly vulnerable to preventable adverse drug events, due to the complexity of medication weight-based dosing, coordination between multiple caregivers, and the use of liquid medications. There is a critical need for generalizable, rigorous study of medication error and injury in children with chronic conditions to inform intervention. Pediatric cancer is an ideal model condition to understand chronic disease care: medication under- and overdoses are life-threatening, all forms of medication are nationally (intravenous, pills, liquids), and our preliminary data indicates that the prevalence of injuries due to medicatin error is very high (3.6% children). Our long term objective is to support the safe and effective use of medications among ambulatory children. In this proposal, among children with cancer, we aim to: 1) categorize rates and types of ambulatory medication error, including caregiver error, and preventable adverse drug events; 2) identify the contribution of error to non-adherence; and 3) identify individual, family, and healthcare system factors that contribute to ambulatory medication error. Our team is ideally suited to perform the proposed work, combining nationally known experts in ambulatory medication errors, including caregiver administration, adherence, and human factors. We will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of 300 children with leukemia and lymphoma from three centers. Families will participate in three home visits. Errors will be measured using a four-component approach we developed and validated: medical record review, medication bottles review, observation of administration, and caregiver interview. Non-adherence will be measured electronic monitoring devices and self-report. We will identify factors that contribute to error using an environmental scan and standardized online questionnaires completed by caregivers. The proposed work will substantially contribute to our knowledge of the epidemiology of error and the range of types of injuries due to medication error. In addition, we will identify factors contributing to ambulatory safety, including provider-family interaction, protective behaviors and tools, and the role of the health system in ambulatory safety. This will be the first study, to our knowledge, of the relationship of adherence and error. Knowledge gained will immediately benefit patients, families, and clinicians who can then take steps to minimize errors and associated injury. Researchers may build on this knowledge to apply human factor theory, widely used in the inpatient setting, to the ambulatory setting in children. The proposed work provides the critical information needed to develop and test novel interventions targeting ambulatory medication error and associated injury."
"9286813","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are Parkinsonian disorders with predominant tau pathology at autopsy. A common non-recombining haplotype at the microtubule associated protein tau gene (MAPT) locus on chromosome 17q21 increases the risk of PSP and CBD and recently our genome-wide association efforts identified variation in additional genes/loci (STX6, EIF2AK3, SOS1, KIF13B, and MOBP/Appoptosin). In addition, other genes, as yet undetected, likely contribute to susceptibility to PSP and CBD. This study aims to resolve the disease-associated genetic variation within the exome and whole genome sequence data from PSP and CBD patients, to determine the pathological consequences and mechanisms underlying these complex neurodegenerative diseases characterized by tau pathology, thus identifying potential therapeutic targets. For Aim 1, we will analyze a unique dataset consisting of over 600 exomes and 2400 whole genome sequences derived from pathology-confirmed PSP patients and 350 exomes from CBD patients. These data will be compared to the 5000 control exomes available through the Alzheimer's sequencing project for single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis. In Aim 2, we will expand our analysis of this cohort and specifically analyze structural variants (SV) and copy number variations (CNV) that contribute to PSP and CBD using a range of analytical software programs which we have extensively tested to achieve optimal sensitivity for each type of variation. For Aim 3, we will use the available exome and whole genome sequence data to assess the association of genetic variation on tau toxicity and pathology with Core C, by assessing tau burden in different brain regions and microgliosis as a surrogate of neuronal cell loss. On-going efforts have shown that using quantitative pathologic measures can help distinguish subtypes of PSP. For Aim 4, we will determine the effect of significantly associated variants/genes identified. We will examine mRNA expression, RNA-Seq data, in vitro functional studies to characterize the effect of the observed mutation on tau aggregation and microtubule assembly, and the effect of these genes/variants on tau protein levels and isoforms in postmortem brain tissue. In summary, the combination of whole exome and whole genome sequence data from pathologically-confirmed and highly-phenotyped patients with an in-depth analytical plan focusing on SNV, CNV, SV and quantitative traits, provides a unique opportunity for novel gene discovery. Identifying novel genes for tauopathies is a critical step towards a better understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying this group of disorders and may help identify prognostic biomarkers for these devastating disorders."
"9319422","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women with breast cancer, particularly those who are older and who receive adjuvant chemotherapy, are at significantly increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Our previous research shows persistent and progressive MCI long after cancer treatment has ended. This cognitive impairment tends to involve difficulties with memory and executive function (i.e. multi-tasking, problem solving) that interfere with daily livin skills and reduce quality of life. The default mode network (DMN) is a brain circuit important for normal cognitive function. The connections between the DMN brain regions tend to naturally decrease in strength as we age.  DMN functional connectivity has been demonstrated to be a highly promising neuroimaging biomarker of MCI in non-cancer populations. Disruption of DMN functional connectivity is strongly associated with conversion to dementia and has even been show to precede other biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Previous studies, including our own, show atrophy of DMN regions and damage to the white matter pathways that connect these regions following breast cancer chemotherapy. We believe that chemotherapy treatment accelerates DMN decline resulting in increased frequency of MCI following breast cancer. However, no studies to date have directly assessed the DMN or its relationship to MCI in breast cancer. The specific aims of the proposed study are therefore to 1) determine the frequency of MCI in older breast cancer subjects who receive chemotherapy, 2) identify DMN neuroimaging biomarkers in older breast cancer subjects treated with chemotherapy, and 3) develop models that predict vulnerability to MCI in this population. We will accomplish these aims by integrating longitudinal multidimensional neuropsychological assessments of cognitive function, mood and behavior with advanced, non-invasive multimodal magnetic resonance imaging techniques and APOE genotyping. We will evaluate 55 women with primary breast cancer prior to chemotherapy, one month following chemotherapy and six months following chemotherapy. We will compare the chemotherapy-treated group to 55 women with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy and 55 healthy females, all matched on important demographic and clinical factors. All groups will be assessed at the same time intervals. We will emphasize the assessment of memory and executive function as well as DMN functional connectivity. We will incorporate clinical, demographic, psychiatric (e.g. depression, fatigue) and genetic (e.g. APOE) factors with DMN connectivity into our predictive models of MCI. Identifying neuroimaging biomarkers underlying chemotherapy-related MCI will improve identification of individuals at highest risk for neurodegeneration and aid the development of treatments for these impairments. This is of critical importance given an aging society and the increased incidence of and vulnerability to both breast cancer and MCI."

"9209680","Project Summary The dissertation will investigate the main effects of 3 insurance benefit design features: 1. Financial requirements (e.g. copayments, coinsurance and deductibles), 2. Quantitative treatment limits (e.g. annual visit limits), and 3. Non-quantitative treatment limits (e.g. prior authorization), on specialty mental health utilization and expenditures. The study will also investigate how each benefit feature modifies the main effects of the other benefit features on mental health care utilization and expenditures. By providing a thorough and comprehensive investigation of how insurance affects specialty mental health utilization and expenditures, this dissertation will provide needed updates and expansions to the literature on this topic. It will also help policy makers, employers, and insurance companies better evaluate how policies that change insurance benefit generosity may also improve access to specialty mental health care. This study will link benefit design, claims, enrollment, provider supply and plan/employer characteristic data for commercial ?carve-in? self-insured plans from our community partner, Optum®, one of the largest managed behavioral health organizations in the US. The data are from before (2009) and after (2011) implementation of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 (and publication of the Interim Final Rule in early 2010, requiring compliance starting January 2011). As a national mandate, MHPAEA contributes exogenous variation in benefit design. The study uses ?first-differences,? an analytic method that implicitly controls for patient characteristics that do not change over time (but that would otherwise bias the estimated effect of insurance). Using this approach, the study may avoid some selection bias, a common threat to determining the effects of insurance on utilization. Key outcome measures include counts of outpatient psychotherapy visits and inpatient days, as well as annual patient and plan expenditures for psychotherapy visits and inpatient days. Key explanatory variables include deductibles, copayments and coinsurance for psychotherapy visits and inpatient admissions, whether or not outpatient visit limits and inpatient day limits were required, and coinsurance and deductible penalties for failing to obtain prior authorization for outpatient or inpatient care when such authorization was required. Main models will be estimated using linear regression of change scores (2011-2009 values) with clustered standard errors controlled for by generalized estimating equations."
"9203569","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysine acylation has emerged as a prominent post-translational modification (PTM) within mitochondrial proteins. Increased susceptibility of mitochondrial proteins to acylation is a function of the alkaline pH of the matrix, in conjunction with the relatively high concentration of acyl-CoA intermediates. Protein acylation varies as a function of the matrix acyl-CoA pool and is counterbalanced by the activity of various mitochondrial- localized deacylases (SIRT3, 4, 5). As such, metabolic conditions know to increase free acyl-CoAs (e.g., high- fat diet, caloric restriction), as well as genetic knockout of  either SIRT3 or SIRT5 have revealed a wide range of acetyl and acyl (e.g., malonylation, succinylation, glutarylation) modifications throughout various mitochondrial proteins. Although in some cases lysine acylation has been linked to altered enzymatic flux (e.g., lysine acetylation inhibits is citrate dehydrogenase), the functional relevance of these modifications in the context of mitochondrial physiology and disease is largely unknown. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of malonyl-CoA, and genetic ablation of the enzyme in MCD-/- mice results in elevated tissue levels of malonyl-CoA. Our preliminary studies show that MCD in muscle and liver is predominantly localized to the mitochondria. Moreover, Western blot assessment of global malonylation in MCD-/- mice revealed striking elevations in malonylated proteins, particularly in the mitochondrial compartment. Follow up experiments using LC mass spectrometry (MS)/MS revealed widespread hypermalonylation in skeletal muscle tissue of muscle-specific MCD deficient mice (MCDMCK-/-). Included among identified targets of malonylation were two of the three subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), as well as enzymes involved in beta-oxidation, ATP synthesis, the TCA cycle and redox homeostasis. Thus, the current NRSA application will test the overarching hypothesis that MCD defends mitochondrial function in muscle and liver by protecting against hypermalonylation of matrix proteins. In Aim 1 we will identify malonylated lysine residues in both skeletal muscle and liver of tissue specific MCD deficient mice under low fat and high fat fed conditions and then compare these sites with those previously reported for SIRT5-/- mice. In Aim 2 we will focus on hits identified in preliminary studies and SA1 to determine if the hypermalonylation phenotype of the MCD deficient mice is accompanied by alternations in mitochondrial function (e.g., enzyme activities, respiratory kinetics and H2O2 emission/redox homeostasis). Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use a variety of pharmacological and genetic approaches to alter protein malonylation, coupled with targeted LC-MS(MS), to test the hypothesis that protein malonylation exists as a novel regulator of the PDC. Results could implicate lysine acylation as a cause of mitochondrial failure in the context of aging and/or chronic metabolic disorders."
"9131533","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition that leads to heart failure and is the most common cause of heart transplantation. The molecular mechanisms of disease progression are not well characterized, and there are no current therapies available for this condition. A characteristic molecular change in DCM is decreased myofilament response to Ca2+. Thus, we hypothesized that by increasing the myofilament response to Ca2+ we may be able to prevent the development of DCM. As proof of principle, we crossed a transgenic model with a missense mutation on sarcomeric protein, tropomyosin (TG-Tm-E54K), which displays a phenotype similar to human DCM, with a transgenic mouse characterized by a constitutive increase in Ca2+-sensitivity. In these double transgenic mice, DCM does not develop. Results from our preliminary studies indicate that novel beta-arrestin signaling pathways are directly involved in signaling to myofilaments, imparting Ca2+-sensitizing post-translational modification, and improving heart function. In this proposal, we hypothesize that beta-arrestin signaling prevents the progression of and reverses DCM by improving the Ca2+ responsiveness of the myofilament. Our approach is to employ TG-TmE54K mice and treat them with the biased ligand, TRV120023, which acts as an angiotensin receptor blocker but is able to activate beta-arrestin signaling, or Losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker. In Specific Aim 1 we will evaluate the progression of the disease before, during and after treatment in vivo utilizing serial echocardiography. We will also assess left ventricular function in vivo and morphology using hemodynamic studies and histological methods, respectively. To approach Specific Aim 2, we will employ detergent extracted fiber bundles to measure steady-state force and kinetics of treated animals and saline controls. We will also determine the mechanism behind these changes using biochemical methods where we will elucidate the signal transduction pathways activated. In Specific Aim 3 we will use biochemical methods and microscopy to examine beta-arrestin localization to fully characterize these novel signal transduction pathways. We expect that activation of beta-arrestin signaling, while blocking G- protein mediated signaling, will prevent the progression of and reverse DCM by increasing Ca2+-responsiveness of the myofilament. Therefore, results from this proposal will yield pre-clinical data for a potential treatment for DCM, as well as insight into the molecular mechanisms of heart failure."
"9237426","TITLE: Directed Evolution of Novel AAV Capsids for Global CNS Delivery in Rodents and Primates ABSTRACT Many monogenic based neurological disorders present attractive targets for gene therapy, but even with promising proof-of-concept rodent studies, successful clinical translation depends upon efficient transgene delivery and expression across the entire central nervous system (CNS). Directed evolution is a powerful and proven method to develop novel adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector capsids that exhibit properties distinct from naturally occurring serotypes. However, to date, the majority of novel capsids have been derived in rodents or in vitro models whose properties may or may not translate to other species, in particular primates. This proposal will utilize AAV capsid DNA shuffling directed evolution to develop gene delivery vectors for a number of human CNS disease applications. To do this, parallel selections and recovered clone characterization will be carried out in mice and non-human primates (NHPs), combining the expertise of experts on both CNS gene transfer in NHPs and AAV vector design. The experimental plan should independently generate superior AAV capsids capable of global CNS delivery, with cross-compatibility between mice and NHPs. Moreover, we have designed our experimental approach to generate vectors that exhibit selective tropism for neurons, astrocytes, and/or oligodendrocytes, which would be invaluable reagents for research and therapeutic applications. If successful, the AAV capsid reagents generated should create new research tools, broaden the application of gene therapy to more CNS disorders, and facilitate the translation of existing CNS gene therapy approaches to humans."
"9148225","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a treatable eye disease which affects the vision of neonatal infants with a birth weight of <1500g or gestational age of <30 weeks. There are 28,000 infants born each year in the US at risk for developing ROP. Globally, the World Health Organization has declared ROP a leading cause of vision impairment in children, with more than 50,000 babies suffering blindness each year due to this disease. Inad- equate screening of these infants results from the low numbers of pediatric-trained ophthalmologists and ROP diagnostic equipment in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Remote digital fundus imaging (RDFI-TM) has, per the American Academy of Pediatrics, high potential for telemedicine based diagnosis and management of ROP. This can alleviate the burden of repeat on-site examina- tions and ensure all infants receive timely screening. However, current technology unfortunately lacks the di- agnostic sensitivity to replace manual physician exam. To overcome this hurdle RetiVue L.L.C. has developed an early prototype of the RetiVue WF, an affordable hand-held imager that can image the entire peripheral retina without the need to reposition the hand-piece, as now required with current devices. Our imager will provide the highest resolution, highest image quality, and widest peripheral field of view of any portable device, allowing it to finally replace the need for direct physician exam. Our technology will also enable for the first time portable wide-field retinal imaging on older children and adult patients. Phase II efforts will be focused on 1) redesigning our interchangeable imaging module to decrease fogging, enhance sterilization, and improve field of view, 2) refining our patented multi-beam optical design to allow im- proved imaging with decreased lens haze, 3) developing alignment and autofocus assist capabilities to im- prove ease of use and 4) validating in clinical trials that our device has improved sensitivity and specificity for detecting ROP with respect to both existing devices and manual physician exam. Work completed during this Phase II application will lay the technical foundation on which we can commercial- ize the world's first simple-to-manufacture, affordable, highly portable, and easy-to-use ROP screening device. We hope that this highly disruptive device can help overcome the primary economic and technological access barriers to establishing successful ROP tele-screening programs within NICUs in developed and developing countries alike."
"9123516","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting an estimated 5.3 million individuals in the US alone. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathophysiology of AD remains largely unknown. The AD brain is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The discovery of amyloid beta (A?) as the main component of these amyloid plaques, combined with the identification of AD-causing familial mutations in the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) led to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which suggests that A? is the pathogenic culprit and that reducing A? load can improve or prevent AD symptoms. Growing evidence indicates that the intracellular trafficking routes of APP have a major impact on its ability to be processed by ?- and ?-secretase, in the production of A?. Here, we will address the molecular mechanisms controlling the sorting of APP through the endosomal system since recent work indicates that the endosomal membrane is likely to be a primary locale where APP interacts with its cleavage enzymes, ?- and ?-secretase. Specifically, we have obtained evidence implicating APP ubiquitination and the endosomal complex required for transport (ESCRT) in amyloidogenic processing. ESCRT recognizes ubiquitinated proteins on the limiting endosomal membrane and sorts them into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in the interior of multivesicular endosomes. We have identified candidate lysine residues in the APP cytodomain that undergo ubiquitination and control the ability of APP to sort into ILVs. Interestingly, mutating these residues leads to a selective increase in the generation of A?40, the more abundant and less pathogenic species of A?. Although APP ubiquitination appears to be a critical signal in its trafficking, the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) acting on APP has not been identified. F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 2 (FBL2) is a promising candidate as part of the Skp1-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ligase complex. The specific aims of this proposal will be: (i) To precisely map the ubiquitination sites of APP and determine the type(s) of ubiquitin modification bound to this protein; (ii) To investigate the role of FBL2 in APP ubiquitination at the endosomal membrane; and (iii) To determine the in vivo effects of APP ubiquitination deficiency on A? levels and amyloid plaque generation. We anticipate that the experiments detailed in this proposal will provide a better understanding of mechanisms regulating the trafficking and processing of APP through the endosomal system and identify potential new targets for urgently needed AD therapeutics."
"9147997","The objective of the Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS) is to determine whether prolonged suppressive oral antiviral treatment with valacyclovir reduces complications of Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO), thereby improving clinical outcomes in this common and potentially vision- and life-threatening disease. There are 1,000,000 new cases of Herpes Zoster (HZ) per year in the USA, with 10-20% being HZO. The first aim of this double-masked, placebo controlled multicenter randomized clinical trial will test the hypothesis that suppressive antiviral treatment for 12 months with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the rate of new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis or uveitis compared to placebo, at 12 months as the primary endpoint, and at 18 months including 6 months of follow-up after treatment, as the secondary endpoint, in patients with HZO who have had an episode of one of these disease manifestations during the year prior to enrollment. The second aim is to test the hypothesis that suppressive treatment for 12 months with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the severity and duration of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), compared to placebo, at 12 months and at 18 months as secondary endpoints, in similar patients with HZO. PHN is a debilitating chronic pain syndrome that negatively impacts quality of life, especially in elderly patients. The study will enroll immunocompetent patients age 18 years and older who have HZO diagnosed at variable times in the past, with these types of active anterior segment ocular segment disease within the past year. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to long-term suppressive treatment with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily or placebo for 12 months, plus usual ophthalmic care, and followed every 3 months for a total of 18 months, to determine outcomes of new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis or uveitis and/or severity and duration of PHN during 12 months of treatment and for 6 months following treatment discontinuation. The results with regard to PHN may be applicable to HZ in other locations. If suppressive valacyclovir treatment is determined to be effective, the potentially devastating disease burden of HZO and HZ may be reduced for patients, as well as the annual costs to society, estimated in the USA to be one billion dollars."
"9224827","Combination interventions to reduce disparities in HIV infection for transgender women (TW) who have sex with men are sorely needed, as this population is one of the highest risk and most underserved groups in the United States. The goal of this proposed research project is to evaluate a locally developed and potentially effective intervention, the TransLife Center (TLC), which provides combination (i.e., biomedical, behavioral, social/structural) HIV prevention services to adult TW at high risk for HIV infection, in a culturally specific and highly accessible affirming environment. The TLC intervention directly addresses the structural barriers to health promotion among TW through a coordinated screening and service model, including direct access to services most needed and requested by TW: employment, housing, legal, and health services, following a social determinants of health conceptual model. To date there are no evidence-based HIV prevention interventions (EBIs) for TW listed in the CDC compendium of EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap through collaboration between Chicago House and Social Service Agency (Chicago House), a long-standing HIV/AIDS service provider and HIV prevention researchers who have been actively engaged in the development of HIV prevention interventions for TW. Our experience suggests that Chicago House's TLC intervention is feasible and acceptable to the target population, with over 200 HIV-uninfected TW participating in services over the past three years and evidence suggesting potential efficacy of the intervention for both sexual risk reduction and health promotion. We propose to test the TLC intervention in a single arm trial among 100 HIV-uninfected and sexually active TW, ages 18 and older, and evaluate intervention effectiveness over a 12-month period with visits at 6-month intervals (baseline, 6-months, 12-months). All participants will receive standard-of-care HIV/STI prevention and testing services, assessment and linkage to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), as indicated. We will evaluate the TLC intervention via the following aims: AIM 1) To determine the pre-post efficacy of the TLC intervention on the primary outcome: number of condomless anal sex acts without protection by PrEP. 1a) To assess the dose response relationship between intervention exposure as well as exposure to specific components (i.e., employment, housing, legal, and health) on reductions in the primary outcome. 1b) To assess mediation of intervention effects on protective processes (gender affirmation, collective self-esteem, social support) theorized to increase with intervention exposure; AIM 2) To examine intervention implementation experiences through semi-structured interviews with 20 TLC participants and 10 Chicago House staff members. AIM 3) Exploratory Aims: 3a) To describe the trajectory of PrEP indication, uptake, retention and adherence in the community-based sample over a 12-month follow-up period and evaluate the impact of the TLC intervention on the PrEP continuum of care. 3b) To explore whether reductions in HIV risk are associated with epidemiologically-linked moderators including age and race/ethnicity.  "
"9123685","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prion diseases affect numerous species including humans, but a cure for these invariably fatal, neurodegenerative diseases is currently lacking. The ideology of the proposed research involves understanding how prions spread and propagate before they reach the brain where they inflict neurodegeneration and subsequent death. Although the immune system normally aids in clearing the body of infections, prions counter-intuitively utilize a specific part of the immune system termed Complement to spread to sites of replication. Specifically, if you genetically manipulate mice to lack certain Complement proteins, the animals either resist disease entirely or exhibit a delayed disease onset. The immune system consists of two main branches: the first line of defense, termed innate immunity, and a slower yet more specific branch termed adaptive immunity. Complement plays a role in the body's first line of defense against an infectious agent mainly through recognizing patterns common to pathogens yet absent on host cells. Considering prions use Complement to spread disease, one of the aims within involves characterizing the interaction between naturally derived prions and Complement proteins through surface plasmon resonance, a broadly used technology used for studying molecular interactions. Identifying the Complement proteins which directly bind proteins with the greatest strength could provide therapeutic targets for preventing disease progression. Factor H inhibits Complement recognition of host tissues and thus plays a role in preventing autoimmunity. Others have shown Factor H binds both normally folded as well as misfolded prion protein. These findings raise the question of whether Factor H plays a role in limiting the spread of prions through preventing Complement recognition. The second aim described within will test the hypothesis that Factor H prevents prion disease by binding prions and inhibiting Complement recognition. If Factor H indeed plays this role in prion disease, then mice deficient in Factor H will succumb to prion disease at a faster rate than Factor H sufficient mice. If so, then perhaps overexpression or treatment with Factor H could serve to limit disease progression. Ultimately, the proposed projects parallel the NINDS mission through the shared goal of understanding causes and progression of neurological diseases with the ultimate goal to provide potential therapeutic targets for a cure."
"9145186","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this award is to allow me to obtain the training, mentoring, and experience necessary to become an independent health services researcher in patient safety and informatics. My ultimate goal is to develop a career as an academic leader, using multidisciplinary science to improve the quality of health care related to electronic health record (EHR)-based communication. To accomplish this, I will seek to develop and sharpen a skill set essential to working as a patient safety and informatics health services researcher. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain training and experience in three principal areas: techniques to evaluate workflow processes, qualitative research methodologies, and human factors principles. Delays in diagnosis and treatment from breakdowns in communication between providers are a common problem in health care and contribute to adverse patient outcomes and malpractice litigation. The importance of identifying strategies to prevent such delays has been highlighted in a recent Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality Special Emphasis Notice (NOT-HS-13-009). I will build on a foundation of work by our team revealing that despite providers' increased use of electronic health record (EHR)-based tools to manage communication, these delays persist. Multiple factors are believed to contribute to such delays, but three are frequent, well-studied, and serve as ideal targets for intervention. These include information overload from large numbers of messages transmitted to providers, lack of EHR-based communication tools that promote situational awareness, and poor ease of use of existing electronic communication tools, which leads to inefficiencies in message processing. In the research proposed, I will use multidisciplinary approach to evaluate electronic communication tools. Specifically, I will evaluate the processes used by providers to manage electronic messages and identify factors that impact communication efficiency and breakdowns. I will then use this information to develop and test a prototype tool that improves processing efficiency, situational awareness, and ease of use. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: Evaluate provider asynchronous electronic communication management processes in order to identify facilitators and barriers of provider efficiency and situational awareness. Aim 2: Develop an asynchronous electronic communication prototype tool that optimizes provider efficiency, situational awareness, and ease of use. Aim 3: Evaluate the efficiency, situational awareness, and ease of use of the prototype tool in a simulated environment. Two highly-qualified mentors with substantial experience in patient safety and informatics research will supervise training, which will include mentored research, formal coursework, directed readings, and seminars. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for electronic communication tool designs that improve situational awareness, efficiency, and ease of use. This will reduce delays in diagnosis from communication breakdowns and reduce provider EHR message processing burden, allowing more time for direct patient care."
"9123635","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Widespread use or misuse of antibiotics has spurred evolutionarily adaptations that enable bacteria to survive  many of our most powerful drugs. While existing antimicrobials are losing their effect, there has been in recent  years a steep decline in the development of new drugs. If this trend continues, the drugs we have to combat  resistant microorganisms will soon be depleted. The growing incidence of illness and death caused by  antibiotic resistant infections, coupled with the cost that society has to pay for them, reflect our urgent need for  new antibiotics that either block or circumvent resistance mechanisms, or attack new targets. We need a better understanding of the different ways in which resistance develops so that we can develop new methods to identify and counteract it. The research proposed here will provide a broader picture of the evolution of resistance and dissect the genetic mechanisms of its development. We plan to conduct laboratory evolution experiments in which we adapt E. coli to antibiotics from three commonly used classes and discern the mechanisms by which they develop resistance using high-?throughput sequencing and whole genome linkage analysis. Once contributing loci are identified and validated, we will use global epistasis assays and transcriptome analysis to place them in the broader network context of specific signaling and regulatory pathways. We will classify these mutations in order to help simplify and untangle the magnitude and complexity of antibiotic-?bacterial dynamics. Previous research suggests that clinical levels of antibiotic resistance may develop through the sequential accumulation of mutations of small individual effect.  Understanding the order in which different mutations occur will give us information that may be useful for developing better diagnostics and in delaying the development of resistance. Throughout this research, special attention will be paid to the trajectory of resistance in the face of increasing drug dosage and also to associated fitness costs to the microorganism under other conditions. The ability of microbes to resist antibiotics often negatively impacts their fitness in the absence of treatment; however, mutations that confer resistance are often quickly followed by additional mutations elsewhere in the genome that compensate for these costs.  Understanding the order in which different mutations occur will give us information about how strains become increasingly resistant. Also, since the fitness costs determine the strength of selection against resistant bacteria, analysis of these costs may inform novel treatment regimens. The aim of this research is to uncover new targets to combat resistance, new pathways that synergize with a particular antibiotic and, more broadly, to strengthen and enrich the underlying principles that will lay the foundation for the next generation of novel therapies, drug discovery, and diagnostics in the field."
"9226904","Project Summary  Protein aggregation is a central feature of aging and aging-associated degenerative diseases. Various lines of evidence suggest that aging-correlated protein aggregates, typically composed of intrinsically disordered proteins, are themselves toxic. Other data suggests that large aggregates (e.g., amyloid fibers) are neuroprotective, while protofibrils are the toxic species. Finally, some research suggests that aggregates are not themselves toxic, but that they have indirect effects that are problematic for cell health. These contrasting perspectives demand further studies to delineate the biophysical and mechanistic consequences of protein aggregation in the setting of intact cells, tissues, and organs.  In preliminary work, thermal proteome profiling experiments using gel-based assays suggested that the presence of aggregates in cells catalytically destabilizes proximal proteins, enhancing their likelihood of irreversible unfolding. This observation suggests a new hypothesis for why aggregates engender diverse phenotypes, but are nonetheless universally associated with cellular degeneration. Specifically, it is proposed that selective precipitation of components of the proteome catalyzed by the presence of protein aggregates underpins their cytotoxicity, and sensitizes aging cells to stress. A detailed evaluation of this mechanism requires quantitative mapping in living cells of the proteome components sensitized to catalytic destabilization by the presence of proximal early- and late-stage protein aggregates. To enable this objective, thermal proteome profiling using quantitative, proteome-wide mass spectrometry is here employed for the first time to simultaneously determine protein stability curves for thousands of individual proteins in the context of the expression of various aggregating proteins in living cells. Experiments performed using this method will directly test the hypothesis that aggregates destabilize otherwise well-behave proteome components critical for normal cell function, and will determine which components of the proteome are most destabilized by the presence of aggregates. Additionally, chemical biology tools to regulate the proteostasis network will be deployed to test whether modulating chaperone levels can ameliorate aggregate proximity-induced protein destabilization. Mechanistic follow-up studies will confirm top hits and provide insight into why aggregate-induced proteome destabilization induces cytotoxic effects."
"9126567","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primate visual and oculomotor system allows tracking of small visual objects and large moving visual scenes to support optimal visual acuity and visual motor behavior. We use volitional smooth pursuit (SP) eye movements and reflex-like optokinetic (OKR) eye movements to support visual function. Both classes of tracking eye movements require cerebral cortical processing of visual inputs to create initial commands for eye movements. Volitional SP and OKR behaviors offer important perspectives on neural mechanisms that produce sensory-motor behavior, perception and cognitive processing. Our studies focus on the frontal eye fields (FEF) and parietal cortex (MSTd, MSTl, MT), which have been shown to play a role in SP, OKR and perception. However, the information passed between these areas during tracking eye movements remains unknown. Our studies will address this gap in knowledge by providing the first comparative data on visual, eye movement and task related signals carried in feedforward and feedback pathways between frontal and parietal cortex. We will apply novel computational approaches for data analysis, model the functional contributions of frontal and parietal cortex to tracking eye movements, and finally test the model predictions using electrical stimulation and optogenetic techniques to reversibly perturb signaling in this cortical-cortical network.     There are extensive cortical-cortical connections between brain regions but we lack specific information about the role of these connections in complex sensory-motor behavior. Our studies are organized under 3 specific aims to experimental and computational approaches that build on information theory and related statistical methods to account for how different signals (e.g., visual, eye movement) are combined and interact to support purposeful behavior. Our experimental work provides novel neurophysiological data taken from frontal and parietal cortical neurons that we identify as projecting from one brain region to another and 2) the experimental results will be directly compared to simulations developed in computational models of cortico-cortical interaction. Our studies have particular intellectual merit in comparing and contrasting different computational approaches for analyzing frontal and parietal cortical neurons simultaneously. We are developing computational models that are capable of predicting eye movement output using neuronal tuning functions determined experimentally.     Scientific: In our study we will extend existing, as well as develop novel computational approaches for analyzing dependencies between neuronal firing and behavior. Advancing our understanding of how different cortical areas interact to support sensory-motor transformation and perception has broad scientific applications in normal and pathological neural systems. For example, white matter lesions commonly seen in the aging brain and in other disorders of cortical-cortical communication are poorly understood. Our studies could contribute fundamental knowledge to advance brain-driven neuronal prostheses. Our work could also improve our diagnostic possibilities for eye movement deficits.     Dissemination: Our studies take place at the University of Washington's National Primate Research Center (WANPRC) in Seattle and at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) in Munich. WaNPRC and UW are known for excellence in primate neuroscience research. The LMU is ranked among the best German universities. LMU was among the first to establish the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience (BCCN) in Germany. Both of our respective institutions are known as leading centers for research and teaching in neuroscience. The LMU is hosting the Graduate School for Systemic Neuroscience (GSN). The UW reaches out to broader academic community at multiple levels through e.g., the multi-disciplinary Neurobiology and Behavior program and Center on Human Development and Disability (CHDD).     Outreach: The PIs are actively involved in their institutions' research and teaching missions. This allows us to provide experimental experience and training for computational scientists in Munich and training in computational research for experimental scientists from UW in Seattle. We provide opportunities for students, postdoctoral fellows and mature scientists through group meetings where results will be presented to a broader audience. The PIs and Co-Is are actively involved in local science and clinical translation."
"9072835","PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY   We have found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required to sustain activation of the  oncogene STAT3 in response to IL-6 or oncostatin M (OSM), which signal through the common gp130  receptor. In the normal inflammatory response, the initial activation of STAT3 in response to IL-6 or OSM is  soon down regulated by the STAT3-induced inhibitor SOCS3, a potent negative regulator of gp130 and JAK2.  However, in cancer cells, STAT3 phosphorylation is re-established and sustained in a second wave of  activation. A novel complex is formed, involving IL-6, IL-6 receptor, gp130, STAT3 and EGFR, in which Y1068  of EGFR, the known STAT3 docking site, is phosphorylated, thus facilitating the re-activation of STAT3 by a  SOCS3-independent mechanism. We now seek to understand in detail how this second wave gp130-EGFR  complex is formed and how it drives not only STAT3 phosphorylation, but also additional downstream signals  that emanate from EGFR in response to activation by gp130 ligands. We also wish to investigate the functional  importance of the second wave in cancers that rely heavily on the ability of gp130 ligands such as IL-6 and  OSM to activate STAT3. In glioblastoma (GBM), we wish to understand the importance of EGFR in sustaining  STAT3 activation through the mechanism we have identified. In breast cancer, we can now identify the gp130-  EGFR interaction as an important contributor to an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is driven by  OSM, leading to the acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Elevated OSM in the microenvironment  is associated with increased risk of recurrence, while increased levels of OSM receptor on cancer cells are  associated with poor outcomes. We hypothesize that prolonged STAT3 activation, facilitated by the gp130-  EGFR interaction, is a key contributor to poor outcome in patients harboring tumors with elevated OSM.   In Aim 1, we will evaluate many details of the novel interaction between gp130 and EGFR. Which  tyrosine residues of EGFR are phosphorylated in the second wave complex and which downstream pathways  do they drive? Which proteins are present in the complex and what are the functions of each? Which genes  are activated by prolonged phosphorylation of STAT3 in the second wave and how do the encoded proteins  contribute to tumorigenesis and EMT? In Aim 2, the consequence of suppressing or activating the second  wave on the ability of OSM to induce EMT, cancer stem cell expansion, and resistance to chemotherapy will be  assessed. In Aim 3, we will use syngeneic, orthotopic mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer and  glioblastoma to determine the importance of how the presence of immune cells within the tumor  microenvironment impacts the second wave and affects tumorigenesis in general. Our studies will significantly  advance current understanding of how OSM and IL-6, derived from the tumor microenvironment, drive aberrant  STAT3 and EGFR activation, leading to cancer progression and metastasis. Understanding these aspects  should facilitate new therapeutic approaches aimed at suppressing this important signaling cascade."

"9352952","Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex and clinically heterogeneous orphan disease associated with reduced survival. To date, there is no approved therapy for SSc. While the fundamental pathogenic role of persistent fibroblast activation in fibrosis is well established, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests a biological connection between fibrosis and sirtuin (SIRT)-mediated cellular processes that govern aging. SIRTs are NAD-dependent nuclear and mitochondrial deacetylases, and their dysfunction is linked to age-associated pathologies. We made the novel observation that SIRT1 expression and activity is selectively down-regulated in skin biopsies from patients with SSc. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SIRTs exerted potent inhibitory effects on fibrotic responses in both normal and SSc fibroblasts in vitro, ameliorated skin fibrosis in vivo, and even partial reduction in levels resulted in exaggerated fibrosis. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that impaired SIRT expression and function is contributes to fibrosis in SSc, and restoring SIRT activity represses fibroblast activation and represents a potential therapeutic strategy. To test this novel hypothesis, this proposal will evaluate the pathogenic roles of SIRTs in distinct and complementary mouse models of scleroderma; determine the effects and mechanism of action of pharmacologically modulating SIRT activity on the disease process; explore the cellular mechanisms and key molecular mediators for SIRT anti-fibrotic activity, focusing on TGF-beta signaling; and examine if altered SIRT expression or function in SSc is associated with disease severity or progression. We will address these interrelated questions by a comprehensive experimental approach utilizing human and mouse cells, transgenic mouse strains, novel translationally-relevant SIRT modulators, and annotated patient samples. We expect that these studies will identify novel roles and mechanism of action of SIRTs and their modulators in fibrotic cellular responses and experimental fibrosis. Additionally, our results might uncover novel disease biomarkers in SSc. We anticipate that novel mechanistic insights from these studies will significantly advance the understanding of SSc. Furthermore, our studies will help set a framework for innovative SSc therapies targeting SIRT signaling."
"9292162","ABSTRACT ? OVERALL COMPONENT Neurodegenerative tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau), are characterized by tau inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, which tau species are pathogenic and how they induce neuronal dysfunction remain elusive. We hypothesize that there is a crosstalk between tau proteostasis imbalance, in the form of intracellular accumulation and intercellular spread, and neuronal dysfunction. Our vision statement is: Linking tau proteostasis with neuronal activity in FTD. We propose to use a combination of unbiased discovery and focused hypothesis- driven approaches to dissect the mechanistic connection. The Center, composed of three projects (P1?P3) and five cores (MS, CRISPR, Human, Data and Admin), aims at addressing the following fundamental questions in tau pathogenesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will address what causes tau to accumulate and spread in FTD. P1 and P3 will work together with MS core to dissect whether aberrant post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critically involved in modulating tau's failure to be degraded and subsequent release. P1, P2 and P3 will work together with CRISPR core to dissect the uptake and seeding mechanisms, using a combination of hypothesis-driven candidate approaches and genome-wide CRISPRi/a library screening. P1, P2 and P3 will work together with the Human core to validate the findings from iPSC neurons in human tissues. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how tau proteostasis imbalance induces neuronal dysfunction. Despite large amount of evidence supporting the accumulation and spread of tau pathology in animal models and in cultured cells, little is known about the mechanisms behind this toxicity and their direct impact on neuronal/synaptic function in human neurons. P1 and P2 will work together to define the effects of FTD mutations on human neuronal activity both at the single-cell and network levels using whole-cell patch clamp and multi-electrode array (MEA), respectively. P3 will work with P1 and P2 to examine if altered autophagy affects neuronal activity. P1, P2 and the CRISPR core will work together to examine the functional effects of tau oligomerization. In Specific Aim 3, we will examine how neuronal activity modulates tau proteostasis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the release of tau is activity-dependent, supporting a feedback mechanism by which aberrant neuronal activity further alters tau proteostasis. P1 will work with the MS and CRISPR cores to dissect the mechanisms underlying the activity-dependent tau release. P1 and P2 will work synergistically to address if and how neuronal activity could affect the uptake (P2) or seeding (P1) of pathogenic tau. P3 will work with P1 and P2 to determine how altering neuronal activity modulates different autophagic pathways. In summary, the Center is strategically structured to maximize conceptual and technological synergies, full data integration and cross-validation. We anticipate discovery of novel insights into mechanisms underlying tau toxicity, generation of novel resources and reagents, and development of innovative technology platforms."
"9130020","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal prion agents. Transmissibility of the classic forms of CJD by blood transfusion is currently unknown. The proposed project will continue the only active, nationwide look-back study on recipients of blood products from donors subsequently diagnosed with classic CJD. This study began in 1995, and has been working for the past 20 years on the key objective of carefully and systematically assessing the risk of blood borne transmission of this disease in the United States. The major components of the study include collaboration with multiple sources to identify blood donors diagnosed with classic CJD in the United States; working with blood centers to trace the blood components from donors diagnosed with classic CJD to final disposition; collecting vital status and cause of death information (if applicable) on the recipients of blood components; utilizing the data from the study to continually monitor and assess the risk of blood-borne transmission of CJD; and disseminating results of the study to relevant stakeholders.  To date, the study has enrolled 54 blood donors who died of classic CJD and 666 recipients of their blood. Through 2013, 125 of these recipients were presumed to be still alive, 520 were deceased and 21 were lost to follow-up. Post transfusion, these three groups had survived a total of 2719.5 person-years. A total of 187 recipients survived five years or longer post transfusion and 86 of them had received blood donated 60 or fewer months before the onset of CJD in the donor. No recipients with CJD have been identified.  The current results of this large, ongoing look-back study show no evidence of transfusion transmission of CJD. They reinforce the conclusion that the risk, if any, of transfusion transmission of prion disease by classic CJD donors is significantly lower than the comparable risk of such transmission by vCJD donors."

"9173417","DESCRIPTION         Abstract: The role of vitamin D in bone metabolism is well established, but recent epidemiologic and basic science studies suggest that vitamin D related pathways are involved in the determination of pulmonary function, risk of infection, and respiratory health, all factors influencing morbidity and mortality in chronic SCI. These observations regarding vitamin D are highly significant as vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is common in chronic spinal cord injury. Previous research conducted at VA Boston in persons with chronic SCI has demonstrated that longitudinal decline in pulmonary function and chest illness risk are not attributable to level and severity of injury, but to other potentially modifiable factors. The VA Boston SCI research program has conducted epidemiologic studies focused on identifying factors responsible for pulmonary function decline and pulmonary-related illness in chronic SCI. In a cohort of 330 persons with chronic SCI, it is proposed to longitudinally assess the relationship between vitamin D levels with pulmonary function and the risk of future chest illness. Understanding these adverse effects of lower vitamin D levels is particularly important in SCI because of the increased risk of pulmonary-related diseases and infection. Our approach is efficient because it will take advantage of a large SCI cohort enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal health study. The demonstration of an association between pulmonary function decline and an increased risk of chest illness with lower levels of vitamin D would result in a clinical trial assessing the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation that would potentially identify an approach to disease prevention in SCI."
"9172621","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Background. Homeless Veterans smoke at an inordinately high rate (80%) compared to the general U.S. population (20%), and thus are at increased risk for the lethal effects of cigarette smoking. Smoking cessation treatment including smoking cessation aids such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are greatly underutilized, particularly among homeless Veteran smokers. There is a special need to develop effective interventions that target homeless Veterans. Homeless Veterans are significantly less likely to access intensive clinic-based smoking cessation care. While the efforts of our group and others have expanded the reach of smoking cessation treatment options beyond the clinic to include tele-medicine, cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling, and internet based interventions, it has been suggested that there is a need for more innovative and intensive approaches to smoking cessation in order to improve quit rates, particularly among homeless Veterans. The use of intensive behavioral therapies, such as contingency management (CM), may be a useful component for smoking cessation interventions among homeless Veterans. CM has shown efficacy for reducing smoking in other difficult-to-treat populations. Project Objectives. The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that combines evidenced-based treatment for smoking cessation with smart-phone based, portable contingency management on smoking rates compared to a VA smoking cessation specialty care intervention in a randomized controlled trial among homeless Veteran smokers. Specifically, 126 Veterans will be randomized to receive Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART) which combines evidenced based cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling, a tele-medicine clinic for access to NRT, and mobile contingency management (mCM), or to receive VA smoking cessation specialty care intervention. The specific aims and hypotheses are: AIM 1: To investigate the impact of ART on rates of abstinence from cigarettes at post-treatment, 3-month and 6- month post-treatment follow-ups. Hypothesis 1: Abstinence rates will be significantly higher among Veterans randomized to the ART-based intervention than those randomized to the VA smoking cessation specialty care control arm. AIM 2: To evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of the ART intervention. Hypothesis 2: ART based treatment will result in greater cost-effectiveness compared to the control condition as measured by the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio. AIM 3: To assess potential treatment mediators including self-efficacy-related mechanisms. Hypothesis 3: Increased abstinence associated with ART will be partially mediated by increased self-efficacy compared to the VA specialty care control condition. Project Methods and Expected Results. Proposed is a four year project in which 126 homeless Veteran smokers will be randomized to receive either a multi-component Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy or a VA specialty care control intervention. Participating patients will be surveyed at post-treatment, 3-months and 6- months post-randomization. The primary outcome of the trial is prolonged self-reported abstinence at the 6-month follow-up, verified by cotinine assay. It is expected that ART will improve quit rates among homeless Veterans, and compared to specialty care, will be associated with greater cost-effectiveness."
"9261411","R13 Project Summary The first Alaska Children?s Environmental Health Summit: Protecting Children at the Top of the World will convene in Anchorage, Alaska, on October 5-6, 2016 at Alaska Pacific University. Health care professionals, Native traditional healers and elders, researchers, and nationally recognized experts will gather to address primary public and environmental health concerns that disproportionately affect Alaska?s children. Exposures to toxic chemicals in the environment, especially persistent organic pollutants, are linked in animal and human studies with adverse reproductive and developmental effects that may harm future generations. Arctic Indigenous peoples have some of the highest exposure to persistent chemicals of any population on earth, and studies show that children are typically more highly exposed than adults. The conference will bring together experts on developmental and health effects of these chemicals on children in order to inform public health interventions, policies, and to improve health outcomes for current and future generations of children in vulnerable Arctic indigenous populations. The meeting will be live-streamed through the internet to communities throughout Alaska. In addition to the meeting, public educational events will be convened in the evening. Findings will also be made available in a report on the State of Children?s Environmental Health in Alaska."
"9206320","Project Summary: Gene activity is modulated by the way genomic DNA is packaged into chromatin ? a process termed ?epigenetics?. Epigenetic controls are disrupted in many, if not most, human diseases. Moreover, emerging ?epigenetic therapies? could potentially correct epigenetic defects. However, current tools for studying chromatin and epigenetic mechanisms are imprecise, hindering progress towards understanding gene and genome regulation. The proposed project will develop novel tools for mapping chromatin and transcription factor interactions with single-molecule precision, thereby establishing entirely new capabilities for functional genomics. Chromatin is made up of histones wrapped by DNA. Histones are subject to many chemical modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation) whose functions remain poorly understood. In a proof-of-principle study, we captured individual chromatin molecules (nucleosomes) on a surface, probed their modifications with fluorescently-labeled antibodies and Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and sequenced the associated DNA. Based on these encouraging results, we now propose to establish robust experimental systems for detecting multiple histone and DNA modifications concurrently on hundreds of millions of individual nucleosomes. We will then adapt these system for analyzing rare cell types and single cells, and for characterizing combinatorial transcription factor ? regulatory element interactions. In summary, we propose innovative systems for investigating combinatorial chromatin and transcription factor interactions with single-molecule precision and genome-wide coverage. Successful implementation of this technology would transform our ability to study chromatin structure, and hasten progress towards defining the sequences and structures that control our genome in health and disease."
"9176239","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to gain a fundamental quantitative understanding of the mechanisms of visual short-term memory (VSTM) in health. VSTM is a central aspect of human cognition, allowing people to detect changes in the environment. Deficits in VSTM are found in many visual and neurological disorders, including visual neglect, parietal and frontal lobe damage, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, traumatic brain injury, and schizophrenia. A better characterization of VSTM may lead the way to better diagnosis and treatment of such deficits.  In its first period, this project has overturned established beliefs about the nature of the limitations of VSTM. The continuation of the project focuses on the richness of VSTM and in particular the hypothesis that VSTM contains a representation of uncertainty associated with a short-term memory. To test this hypothesis, the investigators use a set of novel behavioral tasks, some of which involve subjects directly reporting their confidence about a memory, while others are designed such that decision performance benefits from utilizing knowledge of VSTM uncertainty. In contrast to other work that uses stimuli such as line drawings or letters, all experiments in this project use simple, single-feature stimuli, allowing for both tight experimental control and precise mathematical modeling.  The project integrates mathematical modeling with the experiments in an essential way. The Ma laboratory is a leader in the large-scale testing of mathematical models of behavior, comparing them using state-of-the-art statistical techniques, and using the results to inform further experimental design. The models in this project are aimed at precisely characterizing the processes by which the brain arrives at a VSTM-based decision. One large category of models that will be tested is based on the notion that observers optimally or near-optimally combine VSTM information with prior and reward information to reach a decision. Beyond behavioral models, the project will use neural network modeling to address how neural circuits might implement the computations involved in the behavioral tasks of the project. Specifically, the investigators ask how the brain can incorporate knowledge of VSTM uncertainty without being explicitly trained on the correct value of uncertainty.  The broader impact of the project consists of connecting two traditionally disparate research areas, namely the study of VSTM and the study of decision-making. Besides potential clinical applications, the project will lead to a better basic understanding of how the brain manages to make good decisions in the face of great uncertainty."

"9111243","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poorly treated pain in older adults with dementia is a critical public health problem. When compared to people without dementia, people with dementia receive less pain medication in the presence of similar pain-related conditions. Gender associated differences in the experience of pain are reported in the literature with women generally experiencing more pain and reporting increased sensitivity. Poorly treated pain leads to many associated symptoms, negatively impacts quality of life, and increases healthcare costs. Exploring the biological reasons for alterations in pain processing is essential to increasing our understanding about pain in older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Vascular dementia (VaD). The paucity of evidence to support best practice pain management in older adults with different types of dementia places these individuals at risk for poor pain management practices. The goals of this project are to determine AD- or VaD-associated psychophysical and psychosocial differences in the processing of pain in older females. Our pilot data in a sample of 12 male and 12 female (age-matched) cognitively normal older adults (ages 65-81) suggests that in response to thermal pain, females reported decreased sensory thresholds for pain and reduced pain associated unpleasantness. A second pilot sample of observational pain in people with AD and VaD indicated that people with VaD may have more behavioral indicators of pain. Using psychophysics (to measure sensory threshold and affective unpleasantness) we will examine dementia and gender-associated differences in thermal pain processing in a broad range of older adults with AD or VaD (age 66-95). Our overall hypothesis is that specific alterations in experimental thermal pain responses, which reflect differences in central pain processing and are of relevance to clinical pain responsiveness, are associated with dementia subtypes (AD, VaD), and amount of white matter vascular lesion burden. These changes may place women with certain dementia subtypes at increased risk for non-detection of pain following injury, under treatment of pain, development of chronic pain, and poor quality of life at end-of-life. Results from this study will contribute to development of improved targeted  pain assessment techniques and pain management approaches."
"9144397","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The interplay between environmental exposures, respiratory tract microbiome, and immune responses related to asthma and other respiratory diseases is not well understood. High levels of traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) have been associated with children's asthma. TRAP can increase adherence of microorganisms to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and damage the epithelial layers resulting in increased susceptibility to microbial growth. Many studies suggest a role for altered human microbiota in the etiology of asthma. Furthermore, circumstantial evidence indicates that bacterial infections in the respiratory tract may play a role in asthma development. The airway microbiota may interact with the innate and adaptive arms of the children's developing mucosal immune system in the respiratory tract, which can be critically important in maintaining tolerance against allergc immune responses. Our recent data show that increased exposure to traffic-related particles at birth is associated with longitudinal childhood wheezing. We hypothesize that exposure to TRAP early in life significantly alters the diversity of microorganisms in the respiratory tract in chilren and this effect persists to early adolescence. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the respiratory tract microbiome of adolescent children exposed to high and low levels of traffic related air pollution during childhood. Children from the existing cohort of the NIEHS-funded Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS) will be recruited for this purpose. This cohort is well characterized regarding childhood exposure to TRAP and indoor aeroallergens as well respiratory health of children from birth to age 12. TRAP exposure at ages 12-15 will be estimated by a land use regression (LUR) model of exposure to truck and bus traffic. Bacterial composition, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and diversity indices in the respiratory tract of children will be characterized by collecting induced sputum samples, extracting DNA, amplifying bacteria-specific PCR products (using 16S rRNA primers), analyzing DNA sequences by deep sequencing, clustering and assignment of Illumina MiSeq reads into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), analysis of OTUs, and determination of bacterial diversity by RDP database and pipeline, as well as MG-RAST and Qiime software packages. In Specific Aim 2, we will assess associations between bacterial OTUs, diversity indices, and TRAP. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the effects of air pollutants on the human respiratory tract microbiome, particularly among children. This information is critically important to understand the interaction between air pollution, human microbiome, and respiratory health among children."
"9242756","The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD."
"9213048","ABSTRACT Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are essential to improve health care delivery and patient outcomes, and are increasingly tied to reimbursement. To date, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system has emerged as the leading prescriptive system for developing CPGs and is widely used both in the US and worldwide. Development of CPGs is the product of group judgment. Surprisingly, and despite the importance of group judgments for issuing guidelines, little work has been done to analyze how the CPG panels make their judgments within or outside GRADE system. Because the GRADE is considered the best prescriptive system for development of CPGs, we hypothesize that the panels' group judgments will accurately reflect a relationship between GRADE key criteria (?cues?) and the strength of recommendations, modified to some extent by other factors known to affect people's decision-making. To address our hypothesis, we will assess the impact of GRADE factors on group judgment process vs. individual panel members according to the lens model (SA#1). We will supplement this analysis with the qualitative evaluation of additional constructs that are not formally included in the GRADE system (SA1b). In SA#2, we will address the role of contextual factors and other factors that may affect the consistency of CPG judgments (e.g., more socially relevant topics, greater diversity of CPG panels, and/or panels with conflict of interest will generate greater discrepancy between individual and group judgments). In total, we will study 14 CPG panels, which will generate about 2,000 practice recommendations. To meet our short-term objectives, we propose an innovative study aiming to explain CPG panel judgments using theoretically sound lens model. Our long-term objective is to improve CPG panel judgments accuracy. By improving understanding of CPG judgment processes, the proposed study will exert sustained impact on the way we develop CPGs. Both public health and healthcare financing depend on reliable, trustworthy CPGs. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand group judgment processes that are foundations of the CPG development."
"9115912","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this U01 proposal is to refine, evaluate, and disseminate a new low-cost and sustainable stepped care program for Obstetrics/Gynecology (Ob/Gyn) clinics that will improve perinatal women's treatment rates and outcomes. There is a tremendous public health need for this research as depression is the leading cause of disability among women of reproductive age worldwide. Upwards of 1 in 5 women suffer from perinatal depression. It has deleterious effects on birth outcomes, infant attachment, and children's behavior/development. Maternal suicide causes 20% of postpartum deaths in depressed women. Although the vast majority of perinatal women are amenable to being screened for depression, screening alone does not improve treatment rates or patient outcomes. Ob/Gyn clinics need supports in place to adequately address depression in their patient populations. Thus, we developed and pilot tested the Rapid Access to Perinatal Psychiatric Care in Depression (RAPPID) Program, to create a comprehensive intervention that is proactive, multifaceted, and practical. RAPPID aims to improve perinatal depression treatment and treatment response rates through: (1) access to immediate resource provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation for Ob/Gyn providers; (2) clinic-specific implementation of stepped care, including training support and toolkits; and, (3) proactive treatment engagement, patient monitoring, and stepped treatment response to depression screening/assessment. RAPPID builds on a low-cost and widely disseminated population-based model for delivering psychiatric care in primary care settings developed by our team. Formative data and feedback from key stakeholders also informed the development of RAPPID. Our pilot work in real-world settings suggests RAPPID is feasible and improves depression detection and treatment in Ob/Gyn settings. Because it uses existing infrastructure and resources, RAPPID, has the potential to be feasible, sustainable and transportable to other practice settings. We propose to compare two active interventions, RAPPID vs. enhanced usual care (access to resource provision/referrals and psychiatric telephone consultation) in a cluster-randomized trial in which we will randomize 12 Ob/Gyn clinics to either RAPPID or enhanced usual care. We will compare the effectiveness of RAPPID vs. enhanced usual care to improve depression severity and treatment participation in pregnancy through 12 months postpartum among 300 patients (n=150/group, 25/clinic). We will then disseminate findings and recommendations via a multi-dimensional dissemination strategy to facilitate national uptake. Our established relationships with stakeholders boosts the potential for widespread dissemination and implementation of RAPPID. Our combined expertise in the integration of obstetric and depression care, cluster-randomized trials and Ob/Gyn make us ideally suited to implement, test and widely disseminate RAPPID. If proven effective, RAPPID will be poised for national dissemination."
"9106578","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell proliferation critically depends on the duplication organelles in interphase and the segregation between the two daughter cells during mitosis. Accurate partitioning of chromosomes and intracellular organelles is crucial to sustain cellular functions over generations. Defects in mitosis can lead to genomic instability and loss of vital organelles, which is commonly associated with the development of cancer. While much progress has been made towards understanding the segregation of chromosomes, the mechanisms that govern the partitioning of vital organelles, in particular of the Golgi, remain largely unknown. The mammalian Golgi is essential for secretion and post-mitotic cell survival depends on the partitioning of a functional Golgi into progeny. Our aim is to define the underlying mechanisms that ensure the faithful partitioning of the single mammalian Golgi during mitosis. At the onset of mitosis, the highly organized Golgi structure vesiculates and reforms after equal partitioning in the two daughter cells. We previously showed that the spindle actively partitions the mammalian Golgi. This process is initiated by the Golgi membrane protein GM130, which locally activates the spindle assembly factor TPX2 to initiate microtubule polymerization. Forming microtubules are further captured and bundled by GM130, thereby linking Golgi membranes to the spindle to ensure the Golgi segregation into the daughter cells. In this proposal we plan to determine the biochemical and mechanistic basis for this process. Our aims are to determine the molecular basis for binding partner and functional switching of GM130 in mitosis; to dissect GM130 functions in microtubule nucleation, bundling and Ran dependency in Golgi-derived spindle assembly; and to elucidate the role of Golgi vesiculation in mitotic progression. Together these studies will provide new molecular mechanistic insights into the regulation of mitosis and the division process of the Golgi apparatus."
"9352402","PROJECT SUMMARY There are a myriad of strategies claimed to reduce hospital falls, but there is little evidence supporting their use, and a recent quantitative review found no evidence of benefit among published hospital fall prevention studies using concurrent controls. Given significant financial pressure, hospitals are seeking a ?silver bullet? to fall prevention, and are all over the board in utilizing costly, unproven, and labor-intensive approaches to fall prevention. Paradoxically, these practices may add to the cognitive burden of patient care and increase patient risk. Understanding and minimizing variation is a useful tool for improving health care quality, but has not been applied to hospital falls. In this proposed study we will continue our 5 year collaboration with the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI), a research and quality improvement group that trains its ~2000 participating U.S. hospitals to collect and report nurse-sensitive quality indicators and staffing data in a standardized format. In our preparatory work, we identified NDNQI adult medical nursing units with 24 month high- (~7 falls /1000 patient-days) and low- (~2 falls/1000 patient-days) fall rates. The proposed research will extend NDNQI data collection to focus specifically on patient- and organization-level fall prevention strategies on high- and low- performing units. Aim 1: Compare patient-level approaches to fall prevention employed in high- and low- fall units. We will extend NDNQI patient-level data collection to ascertain: (1) device, and (2) vigilance and (3) environmental modification strategies and compare their use, adjusting for patient-level risk, on these units. Aim 2: Explore differences in organization-level approaches to fall prevention employed in high- and low-fall units. We will extend NDNQI organization-level data collection to compare: (1) fall prevention resources, (2) labor quality and quantity, and (3) fall safety culture between high- and low fall units."
"9292165","PROJECT SUMMARY The CRISPRi/a core will support research of Projects 1, 2, and 3 by enabling knockdown and overexpression of endogenous genes in human iPSC-derived neurons. The CRISPRi/a technology, which we co- developed, enables highly specific, inducible and reversible control of gene expression in mammalian cells. We use a catalytically inactive version of the bacterial Cas9 protein (dCas9) to recruit transcriptional repressors (for CRISPRi) or transcriptional activators (for CRISPRa) to endogenous genes, as directed by single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). We have established the use of this technology in two modes: to investigate the function of individual genes of interest (reverse genetics), and to conduct genome-wide screens to uncover genes relevant for a biological process of interest (forward genetics). We will support the research of Projects 1, 2, and 3 by enabling CRISPRi/a-based forward and reverse genetics in human iPSC-derived neurons. First, we will generate and validate stable CRISPRi and CRISPRa cell lines from the isogenic human iPSCs expressing wild-type tau or V337M tau that are used by Projects 1, 2, and 3. Then, we will generate and validate sgRNAs targeting axon initial segment (AIS) proteins to enable the investigation of their effects on plasticity and excitability of V337M tau neurons (for Project 1), sgRNAs targeting key autophagy pathways to address the question if modulation of these pathways can restore neuronal excitability of V337M tau neurons (for Projects 1, 2, and 3), and sgRNAs targeting proteins selectively interacting with V337M tau that could underlie the abnormality in neuronal activity and autophagy pathways induced by pathogenic seeding (for Projects 1 and 3). We will also conduct two genome-wide CRISPRi screens. First, we will aim to identify cellular pathways controlling tau uptake, which will then be further characterized by Project 2. Second, we will aim to identify cellular pathways controlling templates tau aggregation. These forward genetics approaches will complement the hypothesis-driven reverse-genetics approaches and provide an unbiased survey of relevant cellular pathways. We will work with the Data core to integrate our datasets with those generated by the MS core, with the goal to identify convergent results from the proteomic and genetic approaches, and to work with the Human core to validate the relevance of our cell-based findings in human patients."
"9132449","Autism spectrum disorder is defined by deficits in social behavior and communication as well as repetitive stereotyped behaviors. The incidence of this disorder is increasing, and higher rates in males indicate that endocrine disruptors in the environment may be major contributors. Of note, young males with autism often have an enlarged cortex, particularly in the prefrontal cortex with greater numbers of neurons and glia (Courchesne et al., 2010; Edmonson et al., 2014). Interestingly, we have also found that pre- and postnatal exposure to BPA results in an increased number of neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Sadowlski et al., 2014). In this proposal, the effects of the widespread endocrine disruptor, bisphenol A (BPA), will be examined during the development of the rat mPFC. The central hypothesis is that BPA alters apoptosis and/or neurogenesis early in mPFC development by changing gene expression and its effects persist through epigenetic methylation. Because there are sex differences in the timing and amount of these early cellular processes, the sexes are differentially vulnerable.  Aim 1 will first delineate when apoptosis occurs in the male and female rat mPFC. Next, on the days surrounding the highest rates of apoptosis and/or when the sexes diverge significantly, pups will orally ingest BPA. Following exposure, apoptotic markers and the number of neurons and glia will be stereologically assessed before puberty and in adulthood. Next, fetal pups will be gestationally exposed to BPA on days of peak cortical neurogenesis. BrdU, a marker of dividing cells, will also be administered to test whether BPA alters the rate of neurogenesis. A subset of animals from all groups will be tested for their conspecific affiliative behavior before weaning age as an indicator of early deficits in social behavior. Overall, this aim will identify the cellular mechanism during development by which BPA can bias the cortex toward an excess of neurons and glia and autistic characteristics.  Changes in gene expression that are concomitant with cellular changes following BPA exposure in the mPFC will be characterized in Aim 2. Genes that have been implicated in autism, such as FOXG1 and Pten, as well as those associated with hormone receptors and apoptosis will be included. Epigenetic changes which indicate long-term effects of BPA exposure will also be examined.  The long-term goal is to know the specific timing and mechanisms of vulnerability to this ubiquitous endocrine disruptor so that exposure can be avoided or ameliorated."
"9174461","Abstract The incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) with vascular degeneration is greatly increased following cerebral hemorrhagic stroke in which cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) occurs in affected brain areas. The most common form of CAA is of the amyloid beta-peptide (A?) type. A?, which is derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages from ?-secretase (BACE1) and ?-secretase, is widely believed to trigger a cascade of pathological events culminating in AD including accompanied by degeneration of vascular cells: vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), vascular endothelial cells (VENCs) and pericytes. While extensive studies on pericytes in CAA have been performed, multiple studies demonstrated that an increasing accumulation of A? in the vessel basement membrane is associated with the degeneration of adjacent VSMCs and VENCs. Importantly, our recent preliminary data showed that cerebral vascular cells from human CAA brains express high levels of ?-secretase (BACE1). However, what causes vascular degeneration or death in CAA remains unclear. We recently reported that a cell death receptor, TNFRI, is required for A?- induced cell death and depletion of TNFRI reduced BACE1. In this application, we will study whether and how BACE1 can be up-regulated in vascular cells and what molecular mechanisms of BACE1 elevation causes cerebral vascular cell death in our new mouse models of AD related CAA. The ultimate goal of this proposal will not only advance our understanding the mechanisms of CAA- induced hemorrhage but, also to, in principle, identify novel therapeutic targets and offer novel alert for potential side effects of BACE1 inhibitors in patients with Alzheimer?s disease accompanying vascular degeneration. Key words: BACE1, TNF? inflammation, animal models, neurodegeneration"
"9268995","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phenomenal advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled systematic identification of genetic variants in human individuals, and the recent FDA marketing authorization of the first next-generation genome sequencer signals the arrival of a new era of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. Nevertheless, DNA sequencing alone fails to provide complete information on the genetic makeup of an individual, as two homologous sets of chromosomes are present in the human genome. Delineation of both maternal and paternal copies, or haplotypes, is critical for determining an individual's genetic composition, and for understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. Yet genome- scale haplotyping, or phasing of DNA variants, has long remained an elusive goal. Existing approaches are prohibitively expensive, technically challenging, require specialized instrumentation, or fall far short of reconstructing chromosome-spanning haplotypes. Arima Genomics has recently developed an innovative new approach for whole-genome haplotyping, combining proximity-ligation and DNA sequencing with a probabilistic algorithm for haplotype assembly. This new method, known as HaploSeq, achieves chromosome-spanning haplotypes with high completeness, resolution, and accuracy in mammalian genomes. As a cost-effective, streamlined technology, HaploSeq is poised to underpin a new standard in genome sequencing in biomedical applications and other markets from pharmacogenomics to agricultural biotechnology. The objectives of Arima Genomics' proposed R&D efforts involve improvement of HaploSeq's ability to phase rare variants in human cells by adapting the protocol to achieve more uniform genome coverage, extension of the HaploSeq algorithm's capabilities to provide genotypes concurrently with haplotypes from the same source sequencing data by developing a new smart-mapping computational module, and demonstration and benchmarking of HaploSeq's utility in ongoing next-generation genetic association studies in partnership with clinical research collaborators at UC San Diego. Successful completion of our research aims will contribute invaluable new knowledge to ongoing investigations of how human genetic variation influences the gene regulatory networks involved in cardiac biology and disease, and will substantially advance the capabilities of HaploSeq toward commercial viability in diverse research, biomedical, and clinical sequencing applications. HaploSeq promises to greatly enhance our understanding of human genetics in health and contribute to the realization of personalized medicine."
"9110430","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide public health epidemic with persons in low and middle-income countries disproportionately affected. The prevalence of T2D in Mexico is one of the highest in the world and the leading cause of death in the country. Adults with T2D in Mexico have sub-optimal self-management and poor metabolic control. Access to self-management education is limited, particularly for the poor and underserved. The first aim of the study is to translate an evidence-based DSME program (Yo Puedo!) to the cultural norms, expertise of providers, and systems of care in Seguro Popular clinics in Mexico (provide care to adults with low socioeconomic status). This will be accomplished with focus groups inclusive of a collaborative team of diabetes experts in the US and Mexico, Seguro Popular clinic administrators, physicians, and nurses, community health workers, and adults with T2D in Mexico City, Mexico. We will also develop and systematically evaluate a theory-based mHealth component (pictorial text-messaging) during this phase eliciting feedback on the cultural relevance and understanding of each text/picture. Content analysis of interviews and text-messaging feedback will result in the Yo Puedo! + mHealth program adapted to the local context. The second aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility (process of implementation, fidelity of sessions, attendance, attrition), acceptability (interviews with providers and participants) and preliminary efficacy of Yo Puedo + mHealth in adults with T2D in Mexico City. We will use a randomized, controlled pilot study in which 40 adults with T2D are randomized to the Yo Puedo + mHealth or wait-list control condition with the hypothesis that clinical outcomes (A1C, BMI, blood pressure), T2D self-management, and self-efficacy will be better in Yo Puedo + mHealth participants compared to the control condition at 3 and 6 month follow-up. The primary outcome is A1C. We also hypothesize that the Yo Puedo + mHealth program is feasible and acceptable to adults with T2D and providers; and that fidelity of the program will be maintained. Mixed methods will be used to analyze the feasibility and acceptability of the program. Efficacy will be evaluated with generalized linear mixed models. This multi-phased analysis will provide important information regarding the potential value of the Yo Puedo! + mHealth program in Mexico City. A sustainable collaboration between Yale, Iberoamericana University, and the Seguro Popular clinics, will be established. This will enhance our future plans for evaluating the program in a full-scale pragmatic clinical trial, and disseminating the program to other clinics in Mexico City and beyond, ultimately improving health outcomes for adults with T2D in Mexico and decreasing societal costs of T2D. We will also learn about the feasibility and acceptability of theory-based pictorial text-messaging in a low health literacy population which has national and international implications."
"9152497","It is estimated that about 12% of reproductive age women in the United States have ever sought medical care for infertility. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) includes all infertility treatments to achieve conception; in vitro fertilization (IVF) is the process by which an oocyte is fertilized by semen outside the body; non-IVF ART treatments include ovulation induction, artificial insemination, and intrauterine insemination. In 2013 in the United States, there were nearly 68,000 babies born from IVF, accounting for 1.7% of all births, a proportion which has doubled over the past decade. To date, there has not been a population-based study of ART and IVF in the United States linking data on ART treatments, birth outcomes, registry-confirmed birth defects, and school performance. With this proposed study we seek to fill this knowledge gap. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of mortality, birth defects, and effect on grade school performance among children conceived through IVF and ART, their siblings, and controls in New York, Texas, Massachusetts, and North Carolina. This proposed study will be based on births from 2004-18, and will include an estimated 163,000 IVF children, 41,000 IVF siblings, and 1,250,000 non-IVF control children. Overall Specific Aim: To compare the rates of birth defects and mortality, and effect on school performance among children conceived with IVF, non-IVF ART, and spontaneously, including siblings. Hypothesis 1: Children born from IVF have higher risks for birth defects than the control group; the risk varies by treatments and parental characteristics. Primary Aims:1) To test whether the risk of birth defects in IVF and non-IVF ART births are higher than in spontaneously-conceived births; 2) To identify parental factors affecting risk within each group; 3) In the IVF group, to identify treatment factors that affect the risk. Hypothesis 2: Children born from IVF have higher risks of death compared to their siblings and non-IVF Control children, primarily due to plurality status (greater likelihood of being conceived as a twin, triplet, or quadruplet, but born as a singleton; or of having been born a twin, triplet, or quadruplet) and associated excess of growth restriction (small-for-gestational age) and prematurity. This greater perinatally-related mortality risk is hypothesized to be nonsignificant by two years of age, and varies by infertility treatments and parental factors (particularly reduced with older maternal age at delivery and higher maternal educational status). Hypothesis 3: Children born from IVF have greater risks of poorer educational performance and are more likely to need special education services compared to their siblings and non-IVF Control children, primarily due to their plurality status (greater likelihood of being conceived as a twin, triplet, or quadruplet, but born as a singleton; or of having been born a twin, triplet, or quadruplet) and the associated excess of growth restriction (small-for-gestational age) and prematurity. This greater perinatally-related educational risk varies by infertility treatments and parental factors (particularly reduced with older maternal age at delivery and higher maternal educational status)."

The system is designed to increase the translation of CFCCC discoveries from the laboratory into the  clinic and improve the efficiency of opening and managing clinical trials. Proposed protocols are brought  forward by individual investigators to either a Disease-Oriented Team (DOT) or a corresponding  multidisciplinary tumor board. These groups are charged with determining their level of interest in and  commitment to the trial, whether the scientific question addressed is of sufficient importance to their field, the  appropriateness of the trial design, the potential to accrue to the trial, any conflicts with existing studies and  prioritization, and possible correlative translation science that could be captured. The principal charge of the  Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) is evaluation of scientific quality and progress. For  scientific quality, the PRMC will evaluate only institutional, investigator-initiated trials (IITs) that have not  undergone this process elsewhere. Cooperative group and pharmaceutical industry trials, which have been  vetted on a national level, are exempt from this review. In addition to scientific quality, the PRMC assesses  whether the clinical trials office has the appropriate resources (e.g. data management, pharmacy, nursing, etc.)  to support the trial, how the trial fits into the broad interests of the Cancer Center (e.g. portfolio balance across  disease areas, potential for accrual of women and minorities, whether the trial is an IIT), and the track record of  the principal investigator in accruing to previous trials. The PRMC will continue to routinely review scientific  progress for all open trials and also consider data timeliness and quality. The PRMC may disapprove a trial,  approve a trial, or request additional information from the PI. The record of deliberations of the PRMC and  correspondence with the PI is documented in the clinical trials management system, OnCore."
"9344775","A poorly explored potential contributor to aging is the mobilization of endogenous transposable elements (TEs), which can be highly mutagenic and promote genomic instability. The goal of this proposal is to determine the functional link between activation of endogenous TEs by the transcription factor Myc and changes to lifespan and aging. Previous data showed that increasing or decreasing levels of the oncoprotein Myc in the model organism Drosophila reduced or extended lifespan, respectively. New data that forms the basis of this proposal show that Myc activates the expression of a subset of endogenous TEs. Because mobilization of TEs can cause insertional mutagenesis, genome rearrangements and DNA damage, they have been proposed to contribute to tumorigenesis and other phenotypes associated with aging. However, a significant hurdle to understanding the effects of transposon mobilization has been a lack of methods to identify de novo TE insertions, since they are unique to individual somatic cells so are extremely difficult to identify by sequencing bulk tissue DNA. Only a single cell approach such as the one described in this proposal allows the number and distribution of de novo TE insertions that occur with age in somatic cells to be determined. Significantly, whole genome sequencing of multiple individual indirect flight muscle (IFM) nuclei from young and old wildtype flies revealed that the number of de novo transposon insertions increased with age. The three most frequently mobilized TEs were also found to be induced by Myc. However key questions remain unanswered regarding the link between Myc levels, TE activation and aging. For example, it is not known where TEs insert within the genome during aging or the frequency at which they mobilize. Nor is it known how Myc activates the expression of a subset of TEs, or whether their activation is functionally important for aging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that is that Myc acts as a pro-aging gene by increasing and/or altering the distribution of de novo TE insertions in somatic cells, and that this adversely affects cell and tissue function leading to decreased lifespan. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1) Compare the genomic distribution of de novo TE insertions in wildtype flies and flies with increased or decreased Myc levels. Aim 2) Define the mechanism by which Myc activates the expression of specific TEs. Aim 3) Determine the functional link between Myc levels, TE activation and changes to lifespan. These analyses are significant because the activation of TEs by Myc could contribute to both cancer and non- cancer age related phenotypes, and suppressing their mobilization may provide a new therapeutic avenue to improve healthspan. The approach is methodologically innovative because it uses novel single cell genomic analyses to identify low abundance TE insertions that cannot be detected using whole tissue or organism approaches. It is conceptually innovative because interventions are tested that will for the first time define the functional contribution of de novo TE insertions to normal and Myc-induced aging."
"9286814","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In order to uncover novel genetic variants that influence tau toxicity, and also recapitulate the genetic diversity characteristic of the human population, Project 2 aims to take advantage of the observation that severity of tauopathy in transgenic mouse models is significantly impacted by altering genetic background. While most transgenic lines have been created on a standard genetic background, a single inbred strain does not incorporate one of the major sources of phenotypic variation in human populations: genetic diversity. The lack of genetic diversity also limits the translational utility of standard mouse models because it grossly underestimates the variation of responses that will be seen in the human population. Therefore a genetically- diverse mouse model of tauopathy will be created in the current study, using AAV to drive mutant tau expression in a panel of Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mice, as well as Diversity Outbred (DO) mice produced from random repeated outcrossing of CC strains. Collectively, the CC and DO mouse populations offer high mapping resolution and broad allelic diversity, carrying 45 million SNPs and structural variants and thus providing a unique opportunity to discover new genes that regulate tau toxicity in vivo. Although there are currently no genetically diverse models of tauopathy that are representative of the diversity present within the human population, the development of such a model would enable researchers to test the efficacy and toxicity of new therapeutic strategies, improving translational relevance by incorporating the genetic variation missing from traditional models. Here, based on the compelling evidence presented in Project 3 demonstrating that antibody-induced elevation of plasma tau fluctuates with disease progression, we will evaluate the extent to which genetic background and disease severity influence plasma tau levels in our AAV-injected, CC and DO mice. These findings will not only provide key insight into the potential significance of changes in plasma tau concentrations to progression of tauopathy, but also offer an indication of the magnitude of variability that could be anticipated in the human population. Collectively, the studies proposed will not only increase our understanding of underlying pathogenic mechanisms and pathways, but also drive the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of tauopathy."
"9230064","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing obesity, through improved nutrition and increased physical activity is one of the goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles initiative. Reducing obesity in rural residents is especially important since they are more likely to be obese than urban residents. Indeed, Iowa residents rank 33rd of 50 states in the percent of residents who are obese and half of Iowa's adults do not meet PA recommendations. Effective interventions to increase PA in rural micropolitan (<50,000 residents) communities are scant since most evidence-based interventions have been tested in urban or suburban areas. In the Midwest, these micropolitan communities are also new destination locations for an influx of Latino populations. The Prevention Research Center for Rural Health (PRC-RH), with a focus on obesity, addresses the health challenges of residents of micropolitan and other rural communities in Iowa through a variety of Center activities and resources as well as the implementation of an intervention research project, ActiveOttumwa. PRC-RH Center activities include maintenance of an infrastructure with cores focusing on community engagement, communication and dissemination of PRC-RH research and best practices, training of public health professionals, students and community members, and evaluation of PRC-RH activities. The PRC-RH has vibrant partnerships with the Iowa Department of Public Health, an active Community Advisory Board, with local health department and community organization representation, in Ottumwa, Iowa, a micropolitan new destination community. The PRC-RH intervention research project, Active Ottumwa focuses on increasing physical activity in Ottumwa by determining the effectiveness of a community-based PA intervention that uses a lay health advisor (LHA) approach - to implement evidence-based PA strategies. Based on the available evidence and strategies from the Community Guide, the Active Ottumwa will implement activities at three levels of influence: 1) community-wide campaigns (e.g. newspaper, TV, and radio announcements, website exposure and public health education programs; 2) behavioral and social support interventions (e.g. behavioral contracts, buddy systems, goal-setting to promote and support PA activities; and 3) land-use policies and access to places for PA, (.e.g. working with local governmental officials and agencies and community leaders to advocate, improve and create opportunities for access and use of facilities for PA). To evaluate Active Ottumwa, mixed methods will be used including a community-wide survey; longitudinal follow up of a cohort of residents that will complete accelerometry, physical and anthropometric measures and survey data; observational measures; key informant in-depth interviews; and project documentation. The research project and PRC-RH will address a major evidence gap in our PA knowledge by adapting intervention strategies tested in urban and suburban areas to a micropolitan new destination community in a rural state."
"9145182","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems improve patient care by reducing redundancy in prescribing and computerized ordering but paradoxically also generate other types of information redundancy that lead to information overload. This presents a challenge for clinicians in providing safe and effective care especially with complex patients requiring synthesis of many clinical elements across a lengthy medical history. We hypothesize that provider usage of clinical notes can be supported through refinement of automated methods to detect new information, facilitation of new information visualization in practice, and EHR clinical note interface optimization. While there is much interest in supporting evidence-based medicine, little attention has been given to assisting clinicians in navigating and synthesizing growing amounts of electronic data for individual patients. Unstructured narrative text is an important part of modern EHRs. Text allows clinicians to communicate complex and nuanced information in a manner that is easily comprehended by others. While analyzing a collection of patient's notes can be formidable, it is necessary for making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Currently, this process is hindered by many factors, including large amounts of redundant information in these texts, increasing numbers of documents, suboptimal user interface (UI) design, and limited time to interact with patients. There is a critical need to optimize the use of EHR clinical notes for providers, which we propose to address in three aims: 1) Refine computational methods to identify new information in clinical notes, 2) Assess the effect of visualizing new information in clinical notes in an inpatient hospitalist setting, and 3) Discover elements of a rationally designed EHR graphical UI to facilitate clinical document usage in practice. Successful accomplishment of these aims will lay a foundation to make clinicians more efficient, improve decision-making, decrease cognitive load, and potentially increase clinician satisfaction associated with using clinical documents in EHR systems."
"9352930","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is projected by 2050 to affect approximately 13.8 million Americans and cost 1.2 trillion dollars per year. Insulin resistance (IR), a reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin, is typically induced by obesity. In late middle-age, IR is associated with deficits in memory and executive function performance and increased AD risk. The applicant, Dr. Auriel Willette, recently found using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data that IR in late middle-aged adults is associated with atrophy, lower glucose uptake, and amyloid deposition in prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain area impacted by early AD that subserves executive function. He also previously found that long-term calorie restriction (CR) in aged rhesus macaques lowers IR, reduces PFC atrophy associated with IR, and improves cognitive performance. The goal of this project is to determine if a previously validated intermittent CR diet that reduces IR in late middle-aged adults, composed of five ad libitum days and two consecutive days of consuming 530 kilocalories (5-2 CR), improves executive function performance and changes PFC functional MRI (fMRI) activation during executive tasks. To accomplish this project, Dr. Willette requires additional supervised research training in human 5-2 CR, clinical trials, task-based fMRI neuroimaging, cognitive testing, AD neuropathology, and endocrinology specific to insulin signaling. Dr. Willette's primary mentor at the National Institute on Aging, Dr. Mark Mattson, is a leader in CR, neuroscience, and conducting CR clinical trials. Dr. Willette will work with a cross-disciplinary team of intramural and extramural co-mentors to gain the required training for performing this study. Specifically, Dr. Willette will add to his two years of clinical experience by being trained in conducting clinical trials through Dr. Josephine Egan, the NIA Clinical Director and Chief of the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation, Dr. Mattson, and Dr. Dimitrios Kapogiannis, a tenure-track Neurologist who has conducted several clinical trials. Dr. Willette will develop expertise in task-based fMRI and cognitive testing from Dr. Kapogiannis, Dr. Arthur Kramer, a leader in the field of cognition and aging with over 30 years of neuroimaging experience, and Dr. Richard O'Brien, Chair of Neurology at Johns Hopkins University. For AD neuropathology, Drs. Mattson and O'Brien are established experts in animal models and older adults respectively. For insulin signaling, Dr. Egan is a senior investigator and pioneer in the field of insulin regulation, incretins, and glucose metabolism. In Aims 1 and 2 (K99 mentored phase), 40 cognitively normal, late middle-aged women with IR on a given visit will engage in a battery of executive function tasks outside of the MRI scanner, perform a fMRI color-word Stroop task that induces PFC brain activity, and perform a fMRI energy-dense food preference task that also activates PFC through cognitive appraisal of food. This testing will occur at baseline and after 8 weeks of either 5-2 CR (n=20) or an ad libitum control diet (n=20). Compliance visits will be conducted every 2 weeks. This project will be conducted through the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation at Harbor Hospital, the NIA's clinical research unit. The NIA Scientific Review Committee has approved this project, and through the Intramural Research Program has adequate resources and dedicated personnel time to be completed in a timely manner. Additional training will include coursework in clinical trials, neurobiology of aging, ethics, management seminars, and workshops for prospective independent investigators including grant writing and tenure-track topics. In Aim 3 (R00 independent phase), Dr. Willette will combine his previous and new training to conduct a similar 5-2 CR intervention in aged patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and IR. In addition to cognition and fMRI, he will acquire and process fluorodeoxyglucose data (FDG-PET) to examine resting glucose uptake in PFC. He will gain FDG-PET training during the K99 phase from Dr. Bradley Christian, senior PET researcher and co-director of PET Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Given that IR is higher in MCI compared to cognitively normal adults, associations with cognition and brain measures may be stronger than in the late middle-aged cohort. The 5-2 CR intervention is expected to improve executive function, stabilize fMRI PFC activity, and increase PFC glucose uptake. These outcomes would have a substantial impact on possible interventions for early AD."
"9226431","PROJECT SUMMARY Human ?-Synuclein (h?S) aggregation is considered as a primary mechanism of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's Disease(PD). Accordingly, the theory of cell-to-cell propagation of h?S aggregates is well- accepted, as it can reasonably explain progressive propagation of h?S pathology and associated neuronal degeneration in PD. On the other hand, the theory does not account for trigger for h?S aggregation. Our recent study suggested that one possible explanation for initial h?S aggregation in PD and related disorders may be disruption of nuclear membrane integrity, as occurs during apoptosis. This exposes cytoplasmic h?S to proaggregant nuclear factors, which remain to be determined, but could include histones. Aggregates released in the immediate vicinity of the affected neurons may template h?S in nearby neurons that may then spread by cell-to-cell propagation, leading to more distant neurodegeneration. Conditions that limit clearance of apoptotic bodies (e.g., age-associated declines in immune competence) would be predicted to accelerate the process. Accordingly, pathological h?S might be at least, in part, a secondary phenomenon associated with loss of nuclear membrane integrity or neuronal apoptosis instead of primary event in the pathogenic cascade of PD. It remains to be seen if abnormal conformers of h?S may compromise nuclear membrane integrity.  In our previous study in support of our hypothesis, we have exogenously inoculated mice brains with h?S aggregates generated from apoptotic neuronal cultures to test neuronal uptake in vivo. In this proposal, we will introduce the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase(HSVtk)/ ganciclovir(GCV) system, a well- established strategy for drug induction of cell apoptosis in cancer therapy, to PD research for the first time and perform stereotaxic brain injection of lentivirus into bilateral substantial nigra (SN) of a mouse line to overexpress both HSVtk and Myc-h?S via lentivirus infection. The animals are from a human ?S transgenic mouse line without any observable pathology throughout the life cycle. Upon GCV administration, this mouse model is expected to self-generate transmissible filamentous Myc-h?S aggregates whose spreading can be tracked by histologically detecting Myc tag. We will investigate in vivo how the initial self-generated Myc-h?S aggregates seed subsequent aggregation of normal non-pathological h?S and whether such propagation of h?S pathology can cause further neuron loss beyond the SN regions. To our knowledge, this PD mouse model will be the first one able to conditionally generate transmissible filamentous h?S aggregates for spatio- temporally tracking propagation of h?S aggregates originated in SN regions. We expect that this study can provide more direct evidence to support our hypothesis, and Braak staging theory as well."
"9255977","Abstract Cell-based assays more closely mimic biology than direct inhibition studies. Therefore, drug discovery companies are increasingly utilizing cellular screening assays. Current reporter systems are unable to reliably measure in-cell transient protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, many are based upon split enzyme systems, which require long incubation steps, are not real-time and are typically low throughput. In order to improve on these existing technologies, we will develop a split SUMOstar system engineered to contain a tetracysteine recognition motif for a biarsenical-based fluorophores. There are several advantages for using split a SUMOstar fluorescent reporter system, including relatively small fusions (~6 Kda) to the target proteins of interest, lower non-specific interaction with native proteins and the ability to take real-time measurements in high-throughput applications. Furthermore, using structural based mutagenesis, we can engineer the kinetics and binding affinity of the split SUMO interaction, allowing us to fine-tune the reporter assay to measure transient protein-protein interactions."
"9150291","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in the US. Currently, it is thought that sporadic cases of CRC arise when mutations in the APC tumor suppressor/ß-catenin pathway occur in stem cells. Treatments for metastatic CRC largely target cells undergoing division, including healthy cells, resulting in side effects that greatly limit dose and, consequently, efficacy. Unfortunately, these  treatments are also rarely curative. There is considerable hope, however, that selective targeting of tumor- sustaining stem cell populations will induce fewer side effects and improve likelihood of complete responses. The immune system has an exquisite capacity for distinguishing subtle differences between antigens, like the differences between normal cells and cancer cells. Although cancer normally suppresses the immune system, this suppression can be overcome through immunotherapy. In the proposed experiments, we will utilize an immunologic activation mechanism of previously unrecognized potency for treatment of CRC. This mechanism is initiated by IgG binding to tumor cells to form immune complexes (ICs) that potently activate dendritic cells (DCs) to induce T cell-mediated tumor immunity. This mechanism of IC-activated immunity was discovered in our laboratory during studies investigating rejection of engrafted allogeneic tumors. We found that this IC- activated immunity could be applied therapeutically to treat melanoma in a clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model, as well as various epithelial cancer cell lines including breast, lung, pancreas. The purpose of Aim 1 is to assess one therapeutic strategy using IC-activated DCs to target the immune system against colon cancer stem cells. IC-activated DC vaccination using tumor stem cells will be compared with vaccination using bulk tumor cells. Tumor-bearing mice will be administered DCs and monitored by colonoscopy for responses to therapy. Aim 2 describes an independent strategy for using IC-activated DCs to target tumor stem cells. First, RNA sequencing will be performed to determine changes in the transcriptome of tumor stem cells. Both mutated and aberrantly expressed genes in tumor stem cells will be subject to T cell epitope prediction algorithms. The peptides constituting altered or overexpressed T cell epitopes in total tumor cells, as well as in tumor stem cell populations, will be chemically crosslinked wit IgG to form ICs. These artificial peptide-ICs will be used to activate DCs against desired target peptides in order to stimulate target peptide-recognizing T cells. We expect that in both Aims, targeting tumor stem cells rather than bulk tumor cells will confer additional therapeutic benefit.  The strategy developed in Aim 2 will also potentially help enable a novel, personalized immunotherapy for cancer."
"9242350","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Compelling evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is an early prominent feature in susceptible neurons in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo continual fission and fusion events. Most recent studies from multiple groups including ours suggested a likely involvement of abnormal mitochondrial dynamics in AD brain. Indeed, overexpression of APP mutant or A? treatment induces profound mitochondrial fragmentation, ultrastructural deficits and altered distribution which are likely causally involved in A?-induced spine loss and synaptic abnormalities in hippocampal neurons. A?-induced changes in mitochondrial dynamics and distribution are also early events in animal models of AD. However, molecular mechanisms underlying A?-induced abnormal mitochondrial dynamics remains to be determined. Mitochondrial dynamics and function may be modulated by calcium signaling. Notably, a critical role of intracellular calcium dysregulation in the pathogenesis of AD has long been postulated. It is well established that A? oligomers induce a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular calcium in neurons which mediate A?-induced neuronal abnormalities including spine loss and synaptic dysfunction likely through the activation of calcium- dependent signaling molecules such as calpain and calcineurin. Importantly, our pilot study demonstrated that soluble A? oligomers induce elevation in cytosolic calcium which precedes mitochondrial fragmentation, and elevated mitochondrial calcium coincides with a wave of rapid decrease in mitochondrial length, suggesting that A?-induced aberrant calcium signaling is involved in the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics. This is likely through the modulation of mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins since our preliminary studies demonstrated that ADDLs caused reduction in DLP1/OPA1/Mfn1/2 and dephosphorylation of DLP1 at Ser637. Therefore, we hypothesize that A?- induced aberrant calcium signaling causes posttranslational changes (i.e., modifications and/or degradation) in mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins that leads to abnormal mitochondrial dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we will characterized the causal role of aberrant calcium signaling in mediating A?-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and abnormal mitochondrial transport/distribution in details both in vitro and in vivo. Our proposed studies will provide mechanistic insights into mitochondrial dynamic abnormalities in AD by linking two important deficits (i.e., calcium dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction) involved in the pathogenesis of AD, which could serve as foundation for future drug development."
"9126255","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To respond to the HIV epidemic and reduce health disparities in HIV incidence and outcomes, we propose a Prevention Research Center (PRC) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) that facilitates significant and innovative health science research through partnerships with public health colleagues that ultimately improves public health. The HIV epidemic continues to be a major public health crisis in the U.S., with more than 1 million people living with HIV and more than 50,000 becoming newly infected every year1. Given the progress in preventing and treating HIV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified HIV as a winnable battle, Healthy People 2020 has included HIV as a topic area, sexual health is part of the National Prevention Strategy, and the White House has made HIV a policy priority with the release of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. HIV has had a disproportionate impact on African Americans, representing one of the largest health disparities in the U.S. While comprising just 13% of the total national population, African Americans account for 51% of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. While HIV disproportionately impacts African Americans, Black gay and other men who have sex with men (BMSM) are particularly impacted. In particular young BMSM (aged 13 - 24 years) are the only subpopulation where the rate of new infections continues to increase. These national data highlight the urgent need to focus research on eliminating HIV health disparities among African Americans in general and BMSM in particular. This application proposes to develop and implement authentic community engagement and support implementation of a research project that focuses on linking, engaging and reengaging in care young BMSM living with HIV. Our overall aims are to:  1. Establish a Prevention Research Center that focuses on appropriate adaptation, dissemination and  implementation of HIV health disparities research for application to policy, programs and practices;  2. Enhance collaborations with partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies,  institutions and universities to facilitate innovative, high-impact, multidisciplinary HIV research and  knowledge translation to training, programs, practices and policies;  3. Increase the capacity of partners in the community, health care systems, government agencies,  institutions and universities to understand and implement the findings from HIV research through  targeted training, communication and dissemination; and  4. Develop an implementation research portfolio that translates and adapts an evidence-based  intervention into practice settings. We propose to begin this portfolio by studying the implementation of an evaluated intervention to improve linkage of HIV-infected young Black MSM to clinical care."
"9242421","Abstract Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are a widely used class of sedative and anti-anxiety medications, and their usage increases with age (NIH news, 2014). While BZDs are powerfully effective for treating hyper-excitatory disorders, they can have serious side effects, such as motor deficits. The vast majority of elderly BZD users stays in BZD therapy for a prolonged period (NIH news, 2014), which exacerbates the motoric deficits. The adverse effects and long-term use of BZD are seen more in elderly women than other age/gender population groups. However, how chronic BZD (cBZD) usage impairs the motoric function of elderly women remains virtually unknown. The objective for this proposal is to establish a transgenic mouse model that is capable of identifying the mechanism by which cBZD induces motoric aging in female subjects. BZD binds to the GABA- BZD receptor complex, thereby eliciting CNS depressant effects. It is also well known that BZDs including diazepam, lorazepam, and alprazolam, bind to mitochondrial BZD receptors (mBZD-R), located in mitochondrial membranes. The excessive stimulation of mBZD-R damages mitochondrial membranes where mitochondrial respiration takes place, consequently overproducing reactive O2 species (ROS). The binding of BZD to mBZD-R was significantly increased in the cerebellum of the elderly with cognitive disorders (Yasuno et al., 2012), suggesting that mBZD-R plays a role in brain aging. In particular, mBZD-R activity involves pro- apoptotic protein p38 such that a p38 inhibitor attenuates the apoptosis induced by mBZD-R ligands (Sutter et al., 2004). Since ROS activates p38 by phosphorylation, the apoptotic effect of p38 would be more severe in elderly women who lack 17ß-estradiol (E2), which directly scavenges ROS. Purkinje cells are major cerebellar neurons that are particularly vulnerable to apoptotic p38 (see Approach, Guan et al., 2005). Purkinje neurons show an age-dependent accumulation of p38 in a manner that is mitigated by E2 (Jung et al., 2011). We have generated mice that lack p38 in Purkinje neurons, and observed that these mice are more resistant to cBZD- induced motoric deficit and mitochondrial respiratory suppression than wild-type mice. This protective effect of Purkinje p38 downregulation is more prominent in female mice than male mice, suggesting that a female hormone, especially E2, may play a role in that protection. These observations suggest that cBZD provokes an adverse interaction between the mBZD-R and p38 at an E2-deficient age, resulting in Purkinje apoptosis and motoric aging. We will pursue our objective by achieving Specific Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which cBZD induces motoric aging. We will test a two-step hypothesis: 1A) cBZD's binding to mBZD-R age- dependently suppresses mitochondrial respiration and 1B) cBZD induces Purkinje neuronal apoptosis and motoric deficit through ROS-activated p38 at an E2-deficient age. The proposed research is absolutely critical because it is expected to establish a solid model and foundational mechanism that will be a first step toward lessening the motoric deterioration of elderly women receiving cBZD."
"9170932","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progression to fibrosis after acute kidney injury (AKI) may result from maladaptive repair processes and can potentiate kidney dysfunction. The endothelium is the keystone of vascular homeostasis, and vascular insufficiency after AKI may result in a vicious cycle of tissue ischemia, tubulointerstitial damage and activation, and progressive fibrosis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 receptor (S1P1), a G-protein coupled receptor, maintains endothelial barrier integrity and function. The purpose of this project is to determine i S1P1 is necessary for endothelial function and recovery from AKI in prevention of fibrosis. In Specific Aim 1, our preliminary work using a Cre-loxP system to induce deletion of S1P1 in endothelial cells after AKI demonstrates that S1P1 is necessary for recovery of kidney function and prevents early onset fibrosis. We propose to clearly define the contribution of S1P1 in endothelial cells to recovery of vascular function after AKI. In Specific Aim 2, we propose that S1P1 protects kidney endothelial function and prevents a pro-fibrotic response by pericytes. We will manipulate S1P1 expression in endothelial cells in vitro to determine cellular mechanisms underlying its protective role in endothelial cells and their interaction with pericytes. The significance of this research is that it will provide the basis for using pharmacological activatio of endothelial S1P1 as a novel therapeutic strategy for preserving endothelial function during a critical period of recovery after AKI to prevent fibrosis."
"9220122","In order to qualify for substantial tax exemptions, nonprofit hospitals must provide certain types of community benefit in the jurisdictions they serve. Due to specific requirements associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as changing market conditions, it is anticipated that a significant portion of hospital community benefit expenditures will shift from charity care toward other activities. There are vast resources at stake, an excess of $60 billion annually is currently spent on community benefit activities and there is tremendous potential for those resources to serve an important role in integrating healthcare and public health infrastructure. Our proposed research targets a critical need to understand (1) how hospitals fulfill their community benefit requirements, (2) the ways in which hospital community benefit activities evolve in response to the ACA, (3) what factors facilitate authentic engagement with community and public health infrastructure by nonprofit hospitals, and (4) which community benefit activities are effective at improving the population health and well-being. We propose an iterative mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. The findings that emerge from the quantitative study will inform the design and sample of the qualitative study. The information generated in the qualitative study will be tested quantitatively to assess their generalizability to other hospitals and market areas. The ultimate goal is to develop evidence-based recommendations for hospital administrators and policy-makers about best practices with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of community benefit spending to improve population health and well-being.  The quantitative study is focused on analyzing the shift from uncompensated/charity care spending to the multitude of ways in which nonprofit hospitals respond to the changing community benefit landscape. We propose to apply econometric techniques to analyze pre- and post-ACA changes in the type and magnitude of spending by comparing pre-post changes in spending by hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid to those that did not expand Medicaid. This approach will be used to identify and characterize the substitution between types of spending and assess the degree that spending is responsive to local market needs. Our primary data sources include (1) IRS tax filings that provide qualitative and quantitative detail on the type and amount of community benefit spending and (2) hospital financial data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). The results will also be used to identify dynamic systems and hospitals for in-depth qualitative interviews. The qualitative analysis will identify innovative models and approaches to community benefit activities. This analysis is critical to understanding ways in which nonprofit hospital community benefit activities improve the health and well-being of the populations they serve. This knowledge will be useful to nonprofit hospitals and policy-makers at all levels as they consider potential alternative avenues for expending community benefit dollars."
"9352898","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The training and research plan proposed in this Pathway to Independence Award will propel the candidate to become an independent scientist in a tenure-track position at a research university. This award will support her investigation of novel questions regarding structural connectivity of neural networks that subserve episodic memory across the lifespan. She will be introduced to high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging and will receive training in corresponding advanced MRI and multivariate analysis techniques. The candidate's expertise in neurocognitive aging research will also be strengthened by the proposal's focus on component processes of episodic memory (i.e., pattern separation), the neural networks that support these processes, and how they are affected in both healthy aging and in individuals at increased risk for dementia. Importantly, this award will prepare the candidate to submit a major research proposal (e.g., R01) at an earlier stage in her career that would be possible otherwise.  Environment. The University of California, Irvine (UCI) offers a unique array of training and development resources to facilitate the candidate advancing to an independent scientist position. These include a collaborative group of distinguished researchers at the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory (CNLM) dedicated to understanding neural mechanisms that support memory, an exceptional mentor (Dr. Craig Stark, Director of the CNLM) and co-mentor (Dr. Claudia Kawas, Clinical Core director of the UCI Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders) whose pioneering research programs laid the foundation for the current proposal, access to state-of-the-art research and neuroimaging facilities, and a variety of courses and workshops that will accelerate both educational and career development throughout the duration of this award.  Research. The central aim of the current proposal is to investigate neural networks of pattern separation, a component process of episodic memory, across the life span using behavioral and high- resolution multimodal neuroimaging techniques. Episodic memory decline is a hallmark feature of healthy aging and age-related cognitive disorders such as amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Further detailing the neural mechanisms that support component processes of episodic memory may facilitate identification of neural markers associated with cognitive aging, and inform cognitive and neural interventions aimed at promoting successful aging. Episodic memory is a complex mnemonic ability that involves encoding and retrieval of discrete events, including details such as what, where, and when an event occurred. Successful encoding of new information requires that similar events get separated into distinct memory representations. This process, termed pattern separation, is known to rely on medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. However, neuroimaging studies have shown that prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum are also engaged during episodic memory performance. Whereas these distributed brain regions are frequently studied in isolation, a comprehensive understanding of the neural substrates of episodic memory in general, and pattern separation in particular, will require knowledge of how they interact as interconnected neural networks. In the mentored phase of this award, high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to identify more accurate models of MTL (Specific Aim 1) and striatal (Specific Aim 2) connectivity across the human lifespan than has been previously acquired in vivo. Expanding on our earlier work with the perforate path, the proposed study will assess the contribution of local tracts connecting MTL subregions (e.g., perforate path, mossy fibers, and schaffer collaterals) and large-scale tracts connecting MTL to PFC (e.g., fornix, cingulum) to pattern separation performance in healthy adults. It will also be the first to examine integrity of tracts connecting striatum to PFC (e.g., caudate-PFC, putamen-motor) in relation to these mnemonic processes. The independent phase of this award will assess interactions and dissociations between MTL and striatal memory systems, which are frequently regarded as being differentially affected by healthy and pathological aging. We will test the hypotheses that degradation of striatal versus MTL tract integrity accounts for pattern separation declines in healthy older versus younger adults (Specific Aim 2) and that degradation of MTL versus striatal tract connectivity accounts for pattern separation declines in oldest- old versus younger-old adults (Specific Aim 3). These data will directly test cortical disconnection theories, which propose that diminished white matter connectivity accounts for cognitive declines associated with aging."
"9352920","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of visual impairment among the elderly in the United States. This research aims to find its cause at the molecular level. In AMD, like many other age- related diseases, both genetic risk factors and environmental assaults are key contributors. A prominent genetic change in chromosome 10 has been previously identified to be strongly associated with susceptibility to AMD. This genetic variant is located in the promoter region of a protein, called the high temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1). This disease genotype results in an increased expression of HTRA1. We also performed functional studies using the HTRA1 knockout (htra1-/-) mice, and found that the loss of HTRA1 leads to decreased retinal vascular development along with a significant down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Conversely, our experiments show that increased expression of HTRA1 in RPE leads to an AMD-like pathology and elevated VEGF expression. High VEGF stimulates abnormal vascular growth in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer and Bruch's membrane of the eye, which can result in wet AMD. One of our more recent studies, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry revealed that the up- regulation of VEGF by HTRA1 is inversely correlated to the down-regulation of a member of the tissue growth factor-beta (TGF-? family called Growth Differentiation Factor 6 (GDF6). The long term objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which HTRA1 contributes to an increased risk of AMD, and to develop potential therapies for AMD. Our hypothesis is that oxidative stress can induce a higher level expression of HTRA1, which contributes to the risk of AMD by regulating signal transduction, vascular development, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix. Guided by this hypothesis, we propose to conduct studies in following areas: 1) We will investigate how genetic variants can influence the RPE cells to respond to oxidative stress for the expression of angiogenic factors and HTRA1. 2) We will determine whether HTRA1 and oxidative stress impact retinal and choroidal vasculature and pathology. We will also try to determine whether removal of HTRA1 in mouse is protective to oxidative stress enhanced neovascularization in htra1-/- mice and control mice, which will be used to examine morphology and gene expression in the retina and choroid. 3) We will utilize our cloned monoclonal antibodies against HTRA1 to investigate their therapeutic potential by tissue-specific delivery into the RPE cells, aiming to inhibit the abnormal vascular growth. In this scenario, the selected antibody will be converted into a single chain peptide, which will be further evolved to maximize its affinity to HTRA1 and ability to inhibit the protease activity while minimizing its cytotoxicity using a novel protein scaffold evolution technology. A gene therapy strategy will be used to deliver such antibodies into the RPE cells and test their ability to inhibit choroidal neovascularization (CNV) aiming to develop a novel approach to treat wet AMD."
"9145641","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative effectiveness research (CER) particularly that which focuses on patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR), has the potential to provide patients and providers with valuable information on what treatments and interventions best address specific clinical situations and priorities. While our institution has a great deal of experience in health services research, this work has tended to focus on traditional measures, such as presence or absence of a particular clinical event, physiological measures, and test results. While some investigators at the Indiana University School of Medicine (lUSM) and Indiana University Health (Lu Health) have included patient-centered outcomes in their research, patients' experiences and evaluations of their own outcomes are not a priority in most of our research. Additionally, our pediatric health services    research has been targeted at the general pediatric population, ignoring the great need for work in    subspecialty areas. Therefore, the specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) Build infrastructure o expand our research capacity into pediatric subspecialties, (2) Establish a rigorous research program that is focused on patient-centered outcomes and CER, (3) Build capacity and training for faculty who will engage in CER/PCOR in pediatric subspecialties, and (4) Develop methods for incorporating findings into the larger health care system. In order to achieve these specific aims, we will establish the Center for Pediatric Comparative Effectiveness Research at lUSM and lU Health. This Center will be comprised of four Cores (i.e., Faculty Mentorship/Development, Patient Engagement, Informatics, and Implementation Sciences) that will function together in a collaborative, integrated fashion for the development and conduct of CER/PCOR as well as the implementation and dissemination of effective, evidence-based practices. Our vision is that CER/PCOR in the center will be conducted across all pediatric subspecialty disciplines at lU Health. The environment in which we will establish the Center is ideally suited for achieving our specific aims, and active collaborations with existing organizations, resources, and leaders within lUSM and lUH will significantly increase the likelihood of success and sustainability for our efforts in the Center."
"9248725","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care informed by genomic information is beginning to move into clinical practice. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network through its initial phases has provided much of the groundwork for this transformation. The Geisinger Health System project, EMR-Linked Biobank for Translational Genomics intends to build on the knowledge and experience from eMERGE phase II to accelerate discovery and implementation while expanding our understanding of the sociocultural implications of genomics in medicine. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: 1) Use existing biospecimens, genotype and sequence data and EMR-generated phenotypes for discovery in the proposed disorders: familial hypercholesterolemia and chronic rhinosinusitis, 2) Develop and test approaches for implementation of genomic information in clinical practice, 3) Explore, develop and implement novel approaches for family-centered communication around clinically relevant genomic results. We currently have over 60,000 patients broadly consented for research with a large and increasing proportion consented for return of results and deposition in the electronic health record. Over 18,000 patients are genotyped on high density platforms. Our two proposed phenotypes, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) were chosen because both conditions have a significant public health impact in the United States, but they are also ideally suited to the specific aims of the project. They provide opportunities for innovation and extension of current eMERGE methods. While many of these innovations will take advantage of the sequencing done as part of the project, there are several other areas emphasized in the funding opportunity that will broaden the scope of eMERGE research. One of the areas of emphasis for eMERGE III is exploring the familial return of actionable results. FH is well suited to this, as the current clinical recommendation is cascade testing of family members for all diagnosed patients. Currently this relies on the patient to contact at risk family members, but this is less than optimal. We will explore this issue using qualitative and quantitative methods and use the results to design and test novel family communication strategies. Gene-environment interactions play an important role in the development and severity of disease. These are very difficult to study. We propose novel approaches that leverage the assets of Geisinger Health System and the eMERGE Network to develop and apply methods to extend existing projects that study the impact of environment on CRS. This would include the first large scale environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Finally, we propose to lead efforts to apply the tools of economic modeling and analysis to eMERGE projects to begin to quantify the value of implementation of genomic medicine in the US healthcare system. These proposed innovations will magnify the already significant impact that the eMERGE program has had in moving genomic medicine from a dream to a reality."
"9323624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strong social networks (e.g., family, friends, and acquaintances) exert positive effects on older adults' emotional, cognitive, and physical health. Social engagement theory suggests that interacting with close ties and social groups leads to everyday activities that benefit health. Yet, gaping holes remain in understanding how social networks foster well-being via interactions and behaviors in daily life. Different social partners may serve complementary functions. The proposed study addresses three important questions: 1) Do older adults who report a greater variety of social ties engage in more diverse social interactions throughout the day? 2) Do social partners serve distinct global (e.g., social support) and daily functions (e.g., conversations and physical activity throughout the day)? 3) Are these patterns of social networks and activities associated with daily and overall well-being? The proposed study includes an initial interview assessing global properties of close ties and well-being and daily processes among older adults (N = 300). The study will use cutting edge modes of data collection throughout the day over four days: self-reports of social interactions collected via handheld computers, recorded conversations (via electronically activated recordings, EAR), and physical activity measured via actigraphs. The proposed research will address older adults' social, emotional, cognitive, and physical experiences in the following three aims: Aim 1 will examine links between reports of the social network and social partners encountered in daily life. Individuals who report large social networks may interact with some of those social partners on a daily basis, but also report ties to social partners with whom they have infrequent contact. The study considers several modalities of contact (phone, in person, text). Aim 2 will assess how daily social interactions (incorporating relationship type, intimacy of tie, variety of interactions) are associated with daily cognitive, physical, and emotional experiences. A functionalist perspective suggests different social partners serve distinct functions. Aim 3 will examine associations between social networks, daily experiences, and daily well-being and global well-being. Interacting with a variety of social partners may be beneficial for daily mood, and physical symptoms. We also ask whether daily activities (e.g., conversations, physical activity) mediate associations between social networks and well-being. Across aims, we will consider correlates of social networks and daily activities: socioeconomic status (SES), gender, and age. Innovation and impact: Prior research has relied primarily on self-reports of close partners. This study will provide a novel investigation of how such reports are associated with daily social interactions, physical activity, and cognitive activity in everyday life. Researchers have documented the critical role of social ties on health for over three decades, but the proposed study will be the first to examine how social partners contribute to emotional, physical and cognitive experiences and to daily and global well-being. This study sets a stage for future longitudinal follow up of these participants and important information aimed at improving the social lives of older adults."
"9175600","Advanced non-small cell lung cancer is incurable with a median survival of 12 mo. Incremental advances have been made over the past 20 years when the median survival was only 9 months. A major advance was the discovery of driver mutations and agents targeting these have been highly successful, however a small percentage of patients qualify. Recently it was found that immunotherapy produces clinical responses in NSCLC, and the impact appears dramatic with significant improvements of median OS, and many of the responses remaining durable. This major advance came by disrupting a single immunomodulatory pathway (PD1 checkpoint). The prospects for continuing to improve this modality are great given the fact that tumors evade immune rejection in a myriad of different ways. Here we propose for the first time to target another immune checkpoint protein that produces immunosuppression within tumors, the adenosine A2A receptor. This protein is frequently expressed on human lung cancer TILs, and the tumor microenvironment has high concentrations of its ligand, adenosine. We will utilize an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist to prevent T cell inhibition through this pathway. Single agent anti-PD1 is well tolerated and produces a RR of 15% in NSCLC, therefore we will use this as the platform onto which we will add PBF-509, an A2AR antagonist. Safety and preliminary clinical efficacy will be assessed in phase I and two arm (immunotherapy-naïve, and immunotherapy resistant groups) phase Ib clinical trials.The resistance mechanisms operational in immunotherapy non-responders are currently unknown. We will perform pre- and on-treatment biopsies of the patients which will allow us to characterize the productive immune response in the clinical responders, and the nature of the resistance mechanisms in the clinical non-responders.Given the multitude of potential immunoinhibitory mechanisms co-opted by tumors, and the heterogeneity as to which of these are operational in individual patients, clinical response predictive tests are neceassary but do not currently exist for immunotherapeutics. Therefore we also propose to examine the expression of a variety of immune-related genes for preliminary performance as clinical response predictors."
"9360710","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with intractable epilepsy have a ~1% annual risk of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Pre-mortem risk factors are unknown; however, evidence suggests autonomic nervous system (ANS) failure, sustained apnea/hypoxemia, or some combination of respiratory and cardiovascular (CV) collapse underlies the fatal event. Adverse ANS signs are prominent in epilepsy, with ANS-driven cardiac arrhythmias (bradycardia, asystole, tachyarrhythmias) in ~72% of epilepsy patients, hypotension, impaired baroreflex sensitivity (potentially compromising cerebral blood flow), enhanced sympathetic outflow, expressed as increased sweating and decreased inter-ictal nocturnal heart rate variability (HRV) common. EEG characteristics, including post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) is suggestive of high SUDEP-risk, strongly correlate with increased sweating and decreased HRV, and is typically accompanied by profound hypotension. Neural mechanisms underlying these patterns need to be defined. Our findings of damage to pulvinar thalamic CO2 and O2 integration areas, and to left insular parasympathetic regulatory structures in SUDEP victims suggest that an impaired ability to integrate respiratory sensory signals, combined with exaggerated parasympathetic action, inducing hypotension, thus resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion leading to the EEG signs of PGES, contribute to a fatal scenario. Deficits in other respiratory and ANS regulatory areas may participate, but those sites must be determined. We propose to relate focal brain structural changes in persons with epilepsy to particular peri-ictal autonomic and breathing patterns recognized as indices of risk for death. We found, in other syndromes exhibiting sudden death, e.g., heart failure, significant lateralized neural injury in brainstem and forebrain ANS and respiratory areas. Such unilateral injury can induce asymmetric ANS, and especially, sympathetic drive, establishing a scenario for potentially fatal arrhythmia or hypotension. We will determine peri-ictal physiological pattern of EEG, and especially PGES, blood pressure, HRV, baroreflex sensitivity, cardiac arrhythmia, and breathing that lead to risk of SUDEP, collect high resolution T1-weighted, diffusion tensor, and kurtosis images, and relate extent and laterality of injury to the physiological patterns. The studies will provide insights into mechanisms of failure in SUDEP, and suggest pre-mortem indications of characteristics that lead to a fatal scenario that are suitable for targeted intervention."
"9173422","DESCRIPTION     The objective of this project is to develop a tissue-engineered construct including an engineered nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus to treat defects of the annulus fibrosus (AF) and degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Three Specific Aims are pursued:  Specific Aim 1 will consist of establishing in vitro tissue engineered NP fabrication from rabbit and  human NP and MSC cells in hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel constructs, and evaluation of cell  viability, gene regulation, ECM production, and biomechanical properties as a function of gel  biophysical properties, cell seeding density, and extended culture in a disc-like environment.  Specific Aim 2 will entail establishing and evaluating cellular infiltration and functional maturation  engineered AF-like structures starting from rabbit and human AF and MSC seeded nanofibrous  scaffolds in vitro.  Specific Aim 3 will combine the tissue-engineered NP and AF developed in Aims 1 and 2 to form a  composite disc-like construct, and to then apply this construct to an in vivo rabbit disc model of total  discectomy. Efficacy will be assesse via MRI T2 mapping and subsequent ex vivo analysis of motion  segment mechanical, biochemical, and histologic properties. Research Design: This study will utilize in vitro tissue culture for Specific Aims 1-2; Specific Aim 3 will utilize a rabbit animal model and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methodology: Specific Aims 1 and 2 are laboratory-based studies that will utilize in vitro tissue culture. Specific Aim 3 will be performed in vivo with a rabbit mdel for discectomy and tissue-engineered disc implantation with subsequent ex vivo MRI of the spine and tissue analysis. The primary study outcome measures for Specific Aims 1-3 are biochemical analysis of tissue culture and biomechanical analysis of tissue-engineered constructs. Additionally, Specific Aim 3 will utilize these same outcomes, as well as implement quantitative MRI T2 maps of the implanted tissue-engineered constructs with comparisons made to control (non-treated discectomy) and adjacent normal discs. Findings: n/a at this time. Clinical Relationships: The goal of this project is to develop tissue-engineered constructs to trea degenerative disc disease as well as to validate radiologic methods to noninvasively assess potential therapeutic treatments of degenerative disc disease. Impact/Significance: It is anticipated that the proposed study will offer an increased understanding of degenerative disc disease and potential novel therapeutic treatment to both reverse degenerative changes as well as decrease risk of recurrent disc herniation. Further, it will provide critical support for the applicant as he develops a research-intensive clinical practice in spine surgery at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania."
"9111756","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal proposal for the USC Roybal Center for Financial Decision Making will continue and expand upon the work that we have already done to improve our understanding of how people reach decisions about issues affecting their economic status in old age. Building on earlier work, the renewal proposal focuses on the issue of complexity: which decisions are particularly challenging for individuals, which simplifications would improve decision making, and which interventions would be most helpful in improving the capability to make better decisions? We will pay attention to the costs of sub-optimal choices, distinguishing between cases in which suboptimal decisions in a complex environment may lead to large losses in welfare and cases in which complexity does not have substantial consequences. Simplifications of choice environments may reduce the likelihood of errors, but at the same time may also carry its own costs, if for example it requires reducing the set of options available. Our approach will be both conceptual (what is complexity; what dimensions matter most) and experimental. We will conduct a series of pilot projects aimed at understanding the effect of the choice architecture on decisions and understanding how the choice environment can be changed to improve decision-making. For the experimental part, we will rely heavily on the RAND-USC American Life Panel, but we also take advantage of natural experiments, and conduct cognitive interviews and focus groups where appropriate. We aim to translate the findings of the pilot projects into the development of decision tools as well as concrete recommendations for simplifications of choice architecture and language used to describe decisions people have to make."
"9166218","Project Summary: Spatial navigation is a challenge that must be met by all mobile organisms. Although much is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie spatial navigation in animals, the neurocognitive basis of spatial navigation in humans is much less clear. This is partly because of technical limitations: the best tool currently available for noninvasive measurement of brain activity is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but traditional fMRI analysis methods are not well-suited for identifying representations elicited in dynamic, naturalistic situations such as unconstrained navigational episodes. The current project will attempt to overcome this limitation by using a recent technical innovation in fMRI analysis?voxel-wise encoding modeling?to identify the neural representations that mediate active navigation. Specifically, we will model the fMRI response during navigation within a virtual-reality city in terms of the spatial variables that are known to have known cellular coordinates correlates in rodents and non-human primates, and we will then evaluate the model by testing whether it predicts fMRI response in a held-out dataset not used to train the model. Additionally, we will explore whether the representations thus revealed suffice to solve the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM); that is, whether they allow one to keep track of one's position during exploration of a novel environment while simultaneously learning its layout. Aim 1 is to build the voxel-wise encoding model and to use it to identify the neural representations within specific brain regions that mediate dynamic navigation. Aim 2 is to examine generalization across environments by testing whether a model trained in one virtual environment suffices to solve the problem of SLAM in another. If successful, we anticipate that this project will have a major and sustained impact on the field by achieving a quantitative description of how spatial information is encoded in multiple regions of the human brain during dynamic real-time navigation. This will allow us to test specific hypotheses about spatial representations developed from the animal literature, and potentially allow this literature to be leveraged to better understand multiple cognitive functions that rely on the same underlying neural architecture, including spatial cognition, episodic memory, and imagination. Moreover, this project will provide the essential technical foundation for future tests of novel hypotheses about the physiological basis of navigation."
"9092880","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This study addresses research priority areas of patient-centered outcomes and health care efficiency in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Operating room (OR) scheduling is critical for OR management in any hospital setting, and this project utilizes information systems and industrial engineering technologies to address a critical health service need. The perioperative (peri-op) process encompasses three stages: 1) preoperative (pre-op); 2) intraoperative (intra-op); and 3) postoperative (post-op). Solutions to improving OR performance in the intra-op stage can only have negative impact on other stages and impair the performance of the whole perioperative (peri-op) process. OR management is complicated, involving two flows (information and patient) and three phases (OR planning, scheduling, and adaptive control). Because of this complexity in OR management, the standard practice is to use simple rules in scheduling and key performance indicators to evaluate performance. Our recent studies in production scheduling theory identified inconsistencies between every two adjacent stages in the peri-op process, which explains why the currently applied simple rules and key performance indicators (KPIs) are not suitable for OR scheduling. Solutions to OR management should be efficient at the unit level and effective at the hospital level. To achieve efficiency and effectiveness in OR scheduling, we will establish a scheme to evaluate the performance of OR scheduling across the peri-op process from the perspectives of time and quality. Specific Aim 1 (effectiveness of OR scheduling at the hospital level) smoothes the information flow between units across the peri-op process and reconciles conflicting incentives of local management of different units by identifying the relationship among units from the quality perspective. Specific Aim 2 (efficiency at the unit level) smoothes the patient flow from the time perspective by simulation and revising our former heuristics for flow shop scheduling. This simulation model will enable University of Kentucky (UK) HealthCare to carry out OR scheduling for elective surgeries, emergencies and coordination among its three hospitals. Moreover, the application of multi- objective optimization to the findings while extending statistic process control (SPC) technologies in manufacturing and industrial engineering to healthcare systems."
"8999528","PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1)  The mainstay therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) consists of agents targeting the  androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway and chemotherapies, which induce antitumor responses, and in  select men a vaccine and a radiopharmaceutical bone-targeting therapy. The responses with all of these  therapies tend to be short-lived. Conversely, treatment with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)?  targeting drug, ipilimumab, which promotes enhanced T-cell responses and generates memory immune  responses, has led to durable regression of metastatic disease and an overall survival benefit. A recent phase  3 trial of ipilimumab in patients with CRPC demonstrated dramatic responses in a subset of them  and improved survival in those with favorable clinical characteristics, who also tend to have good responses to  therapies targeting the AR signaling pathway. Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of AR signaling  has positive effects on the immune system. We hypothesize that patients with cancers that regress with  therapies targeting AR signaling will benefit from the addition of anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) immunotherapy. In  addition, given the lack of imaging capabilities to differentiate between tumor growth and tumor infiltration by  immune cells as a result of immunotherapy, we propose to develop radiolabeled antibody imaging to evaluate  tumor responses to immunotherapy. We aim to rationally integrate anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) immunotherapy  with agents targeting the AR signaling pathway to provide durable clinical benefit with improved survival in  patients with prostate cancer, and utilize novel imaging techniques to accurately identify tumor responses.  In this project, we will identify molecular changes associated with clinical outcomes of anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab)  immunotherapy for prostate cancer by examining matched tumor and peripheral blood specimens obtained in  recently completed clinical trials. We will perform in-depth examination of the specimens using  immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, gene expression studies, and serum cytokine  analyses. We will prospectively evaluate the most promising molecular determinants in our novel clinical trial  with the aim of linking the interactions between the immune system and the AR signaling pathway. Finally,  because our group has identified other immunologic molecules that may be targeted with radiolabeled  antibodies for imaging, we propose to evaluate this possibility in murine models to provide data for future  clinical trials. Our proposed studies will provide data to enable integration of anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab)  immunotherapy into a treatment strategy for prostate cancer that induces durable responses and improves  overall survival, with the goal of curing the disease."
"9071967","SUMMARY ? CORE C: MELANOMA SCREENING AND STRATIFICATION  The focus of this P01 is the biological interplay between metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and  mitochondrial biogenesis and function in melanoma. Alterations in these functions may promote therapeutic  resistance and at the same time create novel drug sensitivities. Thus, a goal of the P01 will be to understand  the mechanisms underlying deregulation of central metabolism, ER stress pathways, and mitochondrial  biogenesis and function, and their significance for melanoma development and response to therapy. These  studies will provide the basis for melanoma stratification based on changes in pathway activities, independent  of the BRAF and NRAS genotypes. The extensive collaboration among all programs and cores using well-  annotated melanoma cultures and tissues is essential for success of the P01. Core C will play a critical role in  association with Projects 1, 2, and 3 and Core B to achieve the goals of the P01. First, we will provide  biomaterials (melanoma cell cultures and tissue) for experimental use by each of the projects. Second, the  core will also carry out single-agent and combination high-throughput screening for sensitivity of melanoma to  select therapeutic agent libraries developed by the core. Third, we will integrate drug sensitivity data with  genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data on the cell cultures and tissues to be analyzed. Finally, we will  provide comprehensive pathology support and access to clinically annotated archival human melanoma tissue  for translational studies."
"9000518","CORE-019: EARLY PHASE CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT (EPCRS)  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  A major area of institutional support for clinical cancer research is for investigator-initiated trials. The arrival of  new investigators into the OSUCCC, the increased attention paid to translational research and changes in the  funding landscape of clinical trials requires that there be a mechanism for funding investigator initiated studies  of novel agents and/or novel design. The support of innovative Phase I trials and pilot studies was previously  supported by the CCSG-mandated Protocol Specific Research Support mechanism. With the recent changes  in the CCSG guidelines, the Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) mechanism has been employed  since late 2013 as a means of stimulating the conduct of early phase, investigator-initiated studies. The  EPCRS process is overseen by Dr. William Carson, the Associate Director for Clinical Research (ADCR).  Investigators are informed of this OSUCCC support mechanism via official communications from OSUCCC  administration and the Disease Specific Research Group (DSRG) leaders. There is a formal application  process which is conducted quarterly. Proposals are reviewed by a panel, chaired by the ADCR, Dr. William  Carson. Successful applications are selected for CCSG support in the form of research nurse or data  management assistance from the CCC supported Clinical Trials Office (CTO). On average 1-3 studies have  been approved for support each quarter. In the current funding cycle, a total of 13 studies have been  supported by the EPCRS and have accrued a total of 175 patients in the last year. In addition, to EPCRS, the  OSUCCC has a formal, peer-reviewed mechanism, called the Intramural Research Program (IRP), to channel  developmental funds from Pelotonia, our annual bicycle fundraising event, into bench to beside research."
"9162636","PROJECT SUMMARY It is largely unknown how biological complexity of organisms is achieved. Most cellular processes are carried out by proteins through interaction with other proteins. It has been thought that the information that determines protein-protein interactions is encoded within the protein itself. Therefore, it was initially surprising to find that the number of protein-encoding genes and the coding region length have remained fairly constant during evolution from worms to humans. However, the number of genes that produce alternative 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) has doubled and 3'UTR length has increased ten-fold during evolution from worms to humans. Furthermore, we recently discovered that 3'UTRs can mediate protein- protein interactions. We found that long 3'UTRs can act as scaffolds that bind RNA-binding proteins, which recruit effector proteins to the site of translation. During translation, the effector protein is transferred from the mRNA to the nascent protein, resulting in the formation of a protein complex that requires the presence of the long 3'UTR. Generalization of this finding suggests that, in the case of alternative 3'UTRs, translation of the short 3'UTR isoform generates the `naked' protein, which finds its protein interaction partners based on random encounters and will bind to the partner with the highest affinity in its surroundings. During translation of the long 3'UTR isoform, however, RNA-binding proteins serve as recruiters for a diverse set of effector proteins, including chaperones, to achieve alternative protein folds, enzymes that add alternative post- translational modifications, or protein binding partners that interact with the nascent protein to form alternative protein complexes. Thus, we propose that 3'UTRs can substantially increase the number of protein-protein interaction partners and may considerably diversify protein functions. With respect to the mechanism of transfer of effector proteins from the RNA to the nascent protein, we hypothesize that mRNAs with long 3'UTRs that are bound by many RNA-binding proteins may nucleate RNA granules whose hydrophobic milieu seems to facilitate electrostatic interactions, thus enabling the transfer of effector proteins. To identify the protein interactors that are recruited by 3'UTRs, we are developing a method called UTR-co-IP. We will transfect cDNA constructs of GFP fusions with the coding region of a candidate gene that either contains no 3'UTR, or its corresponding short or long 3'UTR. GFP-bound proteins will be obtained by co-immunoprecipitation and quantified using mass spectrometry. This will be the first step in investigating if alternative 3'UTRs may contribute to the emergence of biological complexity. Through 3'UTR-mediated RNA granule formation, they enable compartmentalization, through recruitment of binding partners they increase cooperativity, and through the generation of alternative 3'UTRs they facilitate multi-functionality of proteins."
"9196469","Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling directs the development of multiple organs and tissues in embryogenesis, and is the causative factor in multiple congenital and adult diseases, including cardiovascular and limb defects, kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, and is important in medical applications such as orthopedics, endodontics, and tissue engineering. BMP heterodimers have been shown to exhibit consistently higher signaling activity to BMP homodimers and thus are beginning to be used in therapeutics. To understand how BMP signaling can generate diverse cellular responses in a myriad of biological contexts and affect disease, as well as how BMP heterodimers can most effectively be used in therapeutics, it is imperative to understand the mechanism by which they signal. A key function of BMP signaling in vertebrate development is to pattern the cells along the dorsoventral (DV) embryonic axis during late blastula and gastrula stages. BMP signaling activity is thought to act as a morphogen, specifying distinct cell types at different activity levels. Dorsally-emanating BMP antagonists are important in generating the gradient of BMP activity with low levels dorsally and highest levels ventrally. The gradient of BMP signaling activity has now been visualized at high resolution across the DV axis of the vertebrate embryo. Using phosphorylation of Smad5 (P-Smad5) as a direct readout of BMP signaling, a quantitative method was established to measure P-Smad5 levels in all nuclei of the early zebrafish embryo. Using this highly sensitive, reproducible P-Smad5 immunofluorescence assay, the dynamics and overall properties of the signaling gradient have been determined with high precision. The role of the BMP antagonists Chordin, Noggin, and Follistatin in shaping the gradient are being investigated. The studies here will extend these to determine how the gradient is modulated during the extensive morphogenetic movements of gastrulation and how the Chordin inhibitor, the Tolloid and Bmp1a metalloproteases, and their inhibitor Sizzled, modulate the gradient to establish and maintain it throughout gastrulation as the embryo dimensions change dramatically. The exclusive ligand signaling in DV patterning is a Bmp2-Bmp7 heterodimer, which will also be investigated. This BMP heterodimer signals through two distinct classes of BMP Type I receptor, BmpR1 and Acvr1, that are assembled together in a signaling complex. In the previous grant period, it was found that the kinase activities of the Type I receptors differentially function in the signaling complex. The studies here will use the unique in vivo vertebrate model setting of zebrafish DV patterning to elucidate the mechanism of BMP heterodimer signaling, deciphering the specific roles of each Type I receptor in the signaling complex and the roles of the Type II receptors. Altogether the results will be broadly relevant to BMP heterodimer signaling and its modulation in other biological contexts, in their use in the clinic, and in modulating stem cell tissue differentiation in vitro."
"9219103","PROJECT SUMMARY Every year, seasonal influenza infects 5-15% of the human population, resulting in over 250,000 deaths worldwide. The annual influenza vaccine is the primary public-health intervention against these epidemics. The strains in the vaccine must be selected before the influenza season. Unfortunately, the selected strains sometimes fail to closely match those that end up actually circulating in the human population; such strain mismatches reduce vaccine efficacy. Methods for better selecting vaccine strains are therefore of paramount importance to public health. We will use innovative new experimental and computational techniques to guide better vaccine- strain selection. Two key properties determine which influenza strains dominate a season: successful strains have high inherent fitness (manifested by a low load of deleterious mutations) and an abundance of antigenic mutations in the epitopes recognized by human immunity. We will measure how each of these properties is affected by every possible amino-acid mutation to the viral surface protein hemagglutinin. To make these high-throughput measurements, we will generate pools of viruses carrying all possible codon mutations to hemagglutinin, and then passage these mutant viruses in the presence and absence of human serum. We will then use ultra-accurate deep sequencing to count the frequency of every mutation pre- and post- selection, enabling us to quantify how each mutation affects both deleterious load and antigenic recognition by serum from a cross-section of the human population. To improve vaccine-strain selection, we will use a real-time web platform to overlay our measurements of deleterious mutational load and the antigenic change onto an influenza phylogeny. This platform will enable decision makers to intuitively visualize the ?Big Data? generated by our experiments as they weigh all sources of evidence during the strain-selection process. In addition, we will make our data and computer code readily available, so that others can leverage our work for their own efforts to better predict influenza strain dynamics. This work has direct relevance to public health in that it will help guide better vaccine-strain selection at a fraction of the cost of current approaches, and thereby improve seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness."
"9225579","Abstract Age-related neurodegenerative diseases (ND), which affect the lives of millions of people, are caused by a progressive loss of neuronal function. This loss is associated with the accumulation of aggregated proteins, such as ?-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and APP in Alzheimer's disease. The pathogenic mechanisms underling these diseases, for which currently there are no cures, are not fully understood. Autophagy, a cellular recycling pathway, shuttles excess and damaged cellular components to the lysosome for degradation. We propose that constitutive selective autophagy pathways clear ND-related protein aggregates. In mammalian cells, autophagy has been extensively studied under stress conditions, but almost nothing is known about constitutive selective autophagy processes or their regulation in human cells. Here, we propose to extend our recent studies in yeast about two types of constitutive selective autophagy pathways and their regulation by the Rab1 yeast homolog, Ypt1, to human cells. Rab1 GTPase was implicated in ND and its activation was proposed to inhibit accumulation of ND-related aggregates. However, Rab1 regulates both secretion and autophagy and it is not clear through which process its activation affects ND. Moreover, Rab1 activation in secretion was implicated in oncogenesis. Thus, to elucidate through which process Rab1 affects ND, it is crucial to separate its functions in secretion and autophagy. In yeast, we succeeded in separating the functions of Ypt1 in secretion and autophagy using two approaches: generating autophagy-specific Ypt1 mutations and characterizing autophagy-specific Ypt1 activators. These activators stimulate Ypt1 in two constitutive selective autophagy pathways: clearance of excess membrane proteins and clearance of cytoplasmic protein complexes. Because all the players are conserved from yeast to human cells, we propose to determine whether our findings pertain to human cells. In Aim 1, we will attempt to generate autophagy-specific Rab1 mutations and in Aims 2-3, we will determine whether autophagy-selective activators stimulate Rab1 in two distinct constitutive selective autophagy pathways. If successful, these tools will be used in future experiments to determine whether autophagy- specific Rab1 modulation affects clearance of ND-related protein aggregates. Achieving the goals of this proposal and the future experiments would provide a novel regulation paradigm for clearance of ND-related protein aggregates. Moreover, identification of Rab1 regulators specific for constitutive selective autophagy would provide novel ND therapeutic targets, in line with the missions of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke."
"9169390","PROJECT SUMMARY Tobacco use remains the nation's leading cause of preventable death. The emergence of e-cigarettes and legalized marijuana use, and the increasing concentration of tobacco use among some racial and ethnic groups, poor people, people with mental illness, and young adults are all changing the environment in which tobacco control efforts take place. High quality state and local tobacco control policies and programs not only prevent tobacco use and disease, but can be an important component of health care cost containment, a key concern at all levels of government and in the private sector. The tobacco industry continues to work to stop or blunt these efforts' effectiveness. All tobacco control programs are not equally effective at reducing smoking and health care costs, making it important to quantify the effects of tobacco control policies and programs. Our research will inform the development and implementation of effective tobacco control policies and programs in this rapidly changing environment through three specific aims: 1. Identify and analyze the new challenges to state and local tobacco control policymaking and program  implementation to inform the development of effective responses to these challenges. 2. Identify policy and demographic determinants of smoking initiation, progression and cessation, including  smokefree policy coverage and cigarette taxes, as well as variation in these determinants by race/ethnicity  and socioeconomic status. 3. Quantify the magnitude and quality of tobacco control program spending across states and the relationship  between associated changes in smoking behavior and healthcare expenditures. We will pursue Aim 1 through a series of detailed case studies of the development and effects of state tobacco control policies and programs on tobacco use. For Aim 2 we will merge national datasets, beginning with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, with policy data on clean indoor air laws, tobacco taxes, price and demographic variables to develop new models of smoking behavior that will provide a framework for better understanding how these policies affect individual behavior and health disparities. We will pursue Aim 3 using modern econometric methods to quantify the effects of state tobacco control programs, allowing for differences in program effectiveness on smoking behavior and, in turn, the effects of both smoking and tobacco control programs on health care costs. This more sophisticated understanding of what tobacco control policies and programs are most effective, together with understanding the tobacco industry's evolving efforts to block these policies, will help public health professionals develop, implement, and defend effective tobacco control policies and strategies that respond to this changing environment.  "
"9301237","Project Abstract Understanding the influence of the neural efferent and afferent regulation of ?-cell health and function would be an important advancement. Although it is known that neural input plays a critical role in the health of the pancreas, details of the neuroanatomy and neurobiology of the human pancreas remains largely unexplored. It may be that T1D patients, wherein residual ?-cells continue to secrete C-peptide, could benefit from neuromodulation therapies that stimulate neurovascular regrowth and result in anti-inflammatory effects in the pancreas. Furthermore, neuromodulation therapies may help to improve insulin secretion in patients with T2D or perhaps delay onset of disease for those at high risk for T1D (e.g. first-degree relative with T1D, multiple islet autoantibodies, genetic risk factors). Both knowledge of the functional neuroanatomy and enabling technologies to test this hypothesis do not currently exist. This project brings together a potent combination of experts in islet biology, neurophysiology, bioengineering, and clinical endocrinology with an innovative approach to define the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the pancreatic neural network. A particular strength of our approach is the mapping and correlation of pancreatic innervation patterns with the islet microvasculature in both an animal model and human pancreas samples. Our hypothesis is that pancreatic ?- cells, functioning like peripheral neurons, maintain blood glucose levels, in part, due to the neural regulation of islet blood flow. This novel hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims: 1) To determine pancreatic neuroanatomy. These studies will enable understanding and mapping of the autonomic and sensory efferent and afferent networks in normal human and rat pancreas. Importantly, our studies will map the human pancreatic neural networks utilizing specimens already collected from human organ donors without diabetes and those with T1D or T2D using optical clearing methodologies and high resolution 3D microscopy. 2) To determine pancreatic neurophysiology. We will conduct neural stimulation and recording of autonomic and sensory networks in the normal rat to correlate neural activities with pancreas blood flow and endocrine functions following glucose challenge. Pancreas blood flow, serum cytokines and hormones (insulin, glucagon) will be analyzed. We will also establish a rat model to analyze islet blood flow using in vivo 2-photon microscopy and test neuroprosthetic implants for neuromodulation strategies of islet hormone secretion. The outcomes of these studies will provide critical design data for logical application of next-generation neuromodulation technologies to improve islet health. This proposed work is directly in-line with the SPARC program to understand the neurophysiology of the endocrine pancreas and enable neuromodulation testing."
"9151037","PROJECT  SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Aggression and violence are common symptoms of many psychiatric disorders, but the underlying mechanisms that lead to their expression remain largely unknown. The amygdala is a key region involved in the regulation of emotion and has been implicated as a primary locus of psychopathology.  The medial amygdala (MeA) is a major subdivision of the amygdala and is an important modulator of aggression and violence. Previous studies have shown that high-frequency stimulation of neurons at the MeA can enhance aggression during future social encounters, producing a phenomenon called aggression priming. The precise mechanism by which the medial amygdala mediates aggression and its role in psychiatric illness, however, requires further elucidation. The goal of this PRAT fellowship proposal is to define the role of the MeA in aggression. My preliminary results show that glutamatergic neurons within the MeA respond to stimulation in a frequency-dependent manner and that the MeA can regulate expressions of aggression and violence during a social interaction test. My central hypothesis is that potentiation of glutamatergic synapses at the MeA can prime aggression, leading to an increase in aggression and violence during social interaction. Firstly, I plan to determine whether high-frequency photostimulation (HFPS) using optogenetics can induce aggression priming during a social interaction test. I will test whether HFPS induces synaptic potentiation at the MeA using in vivo electrophysiology and whether synaptic potentiation is responsible for aggressive behavior by depotentiating synapses after HFPS using low-frequency photostimulation, a known protocol for inducing  depression  of synaptic activity. Secondly I will determine the role of serotonin in MeA regulated aggression by stimulating dorsal raphe projections, a primary locus of serotonergic neurons, at the MeA using optogenetics. Finally I will confirm the role of serotonin in MeA regulated aggression using genetic modifications to  the  serotonin releasing machinery in vivo and specialized sensors designed to detect serotonin binding at the MeA. The successful completion of this proposal will have a positive translational impact because preventative therapeutic strategies targeting the MeA can potentially be developed to curb  excessive  aggression  and violence associated with psychiatric disorders based on the findings of the proposed research."
"9163465","PROJECT SUMMARY This project proposes a comprehensive five-year mentored research development program with transition to independence. The research plan investigates the severe clinical problem of intestinal fibrosis and stricture formation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It explores the entirely novel concept of a direct effect of bacterial components on intestinal mesenchymal cells, the chief pro-fibrotic cell type, in vitro and in vivo. We found that human intestinal myofibroblasts respond to activation of bacterial sensing pattern recognition receptors, but only flagellin increases secretion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components fibronectin and collagen 1. This response is post-transcriptionally regulated and dependent on caspase 1, implicating the inflammasome in intestinal fibrosis. Therefore, we propose to explore the following hypothesis: the gut microbiota induces intestinal fibrosis through a flagellin mediated pathway. This hypothesis will be tested through three interrelated, but indepedent specific aims: (1) to define the mechanisms of flagellin- induced post-transcriptional regulation of ECM secretion in vitro (2) to determine the role of flagellin mediated inflammasome activation in the pro-fibrogenic responses in primary human mesenchymal cells in vitro and (3) to explore the effect of abrogating flagellin signaling in experimental fibrosis in vivo during induction and resolution of intestinal fibrosis. Post-transcriptional regulation and inflammasome activation via caspase 1 are two entirely original mechanisms of intestinal fibrosis. We will use a cutting edge transgenic mouse model that allows control of the timing of deletion of bacterial sensing in vivo specifically in mesenchymal cells. This enables exploration of microbial sensing in the prevention and resolution of intestinal fibrosis. The research will be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Fiocchi MD, Lerner Research Institute (LRI), Cleveland Clinic, and will be advised by a panel of international experts in human and experimental fibrogenesis, translational regulation and the microbiota. The advisory panel has worked out a structured career development program, including formal coursework in microbiology, translational regulation and statistics. An ideal intellectual and technical environment is in place locally in the LRI. My career goal is to build and lead an independent research program that will advance scientific knowledge and patient care in the field of intestinal fibrosis. My prior experience with primary human cell systems and animal models gives me the ideal basis to be a successful K08 awardee. The proposed study will provide novel evidence for the direct effect of the microbiota in intestinal mesenchymal cell induced fibrogenesis and stricture formation. These findings could lead to a completely novel approach of targeting the microbiota as a therapeutic strategy to abrogate fibrosis."
"9207385","Project Summary/Abstract  America's increasing HIV epidemic among youth aged 12-24 and our concurrent failure to identify, link to care, and achieve viral suppression among youth living with HIV (YLH) suggests the need to identify novel community-based strategies to leverage gateways and settings where high risk and infected youth can be engaged in HIV prevention and treatment. Scientific successes reducing HIV viral reservoirs among acutely infected infants, stopping HIV transmission from HIV-infected adults with undetectable viral loads, and documenting the efficacy of Treatment as Prevention (TASP) suggest strategies to reduce the trend of increasing adolescent HIV infections. This U19 will evaluate the usefulness of these advances for youth aged 12-24 at the highest risk of acquiring HIV- gay, bisexual, transgender youth (GBTY) and homeless youth (HY) ? as well as youth living with HIV (YLH) in two HIV epicenters (Los Angeles and New Orleans).  All GBTY and HY at five gay-identified community-based organizations (CBO) and homeless shelters will be screened over 18 months. From these screenings, a cohort of 220 YLH and 1,500 highest risk seronegative GBTY and HY will be formed. Over 24 months, this cohort will be repeatedly tested at four month intervals for sexually transmitted infections (STI) and serious drug use, and with 4th Gen HIV tests if seronegative, in order to identify acutely infected youth, engage youth in medical care, and monitor outcomes. Youth are triaged to:  Study 1: Acute infection. Using 60 ARV-naive YLH with established infection as controls, we expect to identify 36 YLH with acute infection. All youth with acute infections will be aggressively treated with at least four highly potent antiretroviral therapies (ARV) and repeatedly assessed to examine if prolonged viral suppression is achieved, with reduced viral reservoirs to potentially allow ARV- free HIV remission.  Study 2: Stepped care for YLH. Adapting strategies to manage chronic illnesses, we will conduct a RCT comparing a Standard Care Arm (repeated assessments every four month and an Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention [AMMI]) to Stepped Care. In the Stepped Care Arm, increasingly more intense interventions are delivered if viral load is detectable: a) the Standard Care Arm; b) an AMMI that is tailored to comorbidities of the specific YLH; or c) a Coach to support during crises, make treatment referrals, and brief interventions. Dried blood spots will monitor viral load and, on a small sample, ARV adherence over time.  Study 3: Engaging seronegative youth in the HIV Prevention Continuum. Youth will be randomized to either: a) an AMMI Arm; b) Peer-Support plus AMMI Arm; c) eNavigator and an AMMI arm; or d) Peer-Support plus eNavigator plus AMMI Arm. Each condition aims to optimize the HIV Prevention Continuum.  An interdisciplinary team of basic, clinical, and applied researchers with expertise in HIV, STI, behavioral interventions, biomedical interventions, CURE research, perinatal HIV, and a history of participating and coordinating multi-site RCT is participating on this U19 from six universities."
"9255397","Approximately 5.2 million Americans are affected by Alzheimer?s disease (AD), and up to 13 million will be affected by 2050. At present, there is no preventive or curative treatment for AD or in age-related cognitive decline and clinical trials of cognitive-modifying compounds have not succeeded in identifying an effective treatment. Despite a lot of efforts, no candidates are available to slow down the development or even cure this devastating disease. Although most of the efforts are focusing on the amyloid and the tau pathways, we have taken a different approach and targeted oxidative stress.  Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic mechanism that underlies both the pre-clinical development and subsequent progression of AD, and one that could potentially be targeted preventively as well as therapeutically. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase during inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metal redox cycling catalyzed by A?, all processes associated with AD development. ROS-catalyzed lipid peroxidation generates bifunctional electrophiles (BFEs). We have shown that BFEs generated by oxidative stress accelerate Aß oligomerization, generating oligomers that have similar neurotoxicity and immunoreactivity as the amyloid-derived diffusible ligands. They inhibit proteosomal activity, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and promote dendritic cell activation of T cells. Importantly, we have shown that levels of BFE adducts on proteins are significantly elevated in hippocampus of AD post mortem human brains, and correlate positively with both the CERAD plaque score and the Braak stage.  We have found that 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) reacts 1,600-fold faster with BFEs than lysine, preventing protein modification in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in hApoE4 transgenic mice, 2-HOBA inhibits all the effects of BFEs described above, and prevents working memory deficit.  2-HOBA, a natural product present in buckwheat seeds, has been developed for use in humans by Metabolic Technologies, Inc. (MTI, Ames, IA). The chemical, manufacturing and control data have been generated and pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology data are currently being collected. In this project, we propose to do single and multiple escalation dose studies necessary to characterize pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and safety of 2-HOBA. We also propose to establish brain penetrance of 2-HOBA and to determine whether it reduces blood and CSF markers of oxidative modification of proteins."
"9173423","DESCRIPTION:     Rationale and Preliminary Data: We will conduct a validation and characterization of the diffusion tensor imaging changes and histopathology of the cervical spinal cord following experimental thoracic contusion injury. Conventional MRI scans to detect edema using T2-weighted imaging are no better at predicting the degree of recovery in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) than a traditional neurological examination. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is showing promise as a prognostic imaging biomarker in SCI. However, DTI at the injury site is often hampered by artifacts from spinal fixation hardware. Our preclinical studies in the rat have demonstrated robust DTI alterations in the high cervical spinal cord (hcDTI) that correlate with injury severity and functional recovery. Thus, our preliminary data indicates that diffusivity in te high cervical spinal cord, as measured by DTI, is a potential biomarker of neural injury in SCI. While promising, a more comprehensive validation is necessary for accurate diagnosis in human SCI. To that end, we will employ our preclinical model of thoracic contusion injury to advance the understanding of the DTI changes in the cervical cord as markers of injury. Hypothesis and Specific Aims: We hypothesize that advanced MRI of the high cervical spinal cord is an accurate biomarker of tissue damage and injury severity that is prognostic of outcome. To examine this hypothesis, we will employ a rat model of thoracic contusion spinal cord injury and perform in vivo MRI, functional assessments, and histopathology. We will test our hypothesis by performing diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and quantitative T2 (qT2) to improve the prognostic ability in the acute setting (Aim 1), establish these measures as a surrogate maker of tissue damage at the site of injury (Aim 2), and elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of MRI changes remote from the site of injury using gold-standard histopathology (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, a multidisciplinary approach using in vivo DKI and qT2, quantitative histopathological analysis, and functional assessments will provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between noninvasive imaging markers and their biological underpinnings and functional implications. We hypothesize that detection of injury in the acute setting will be enhanced by DKI and qT2 MRI techniques. Furthermore, it is believed that the cervical cord DTI changes accurately reflect the degree of injury at the site of injury assessed by the amount of spared white matter. Finally, it is postulatd that in addition to axonal degeneration and demyelination, astrocyte reactivity is a prominent feature of injury that occurs distant from the injury and relates to the degree of functional recovery. Collectively, these studies will establish and validate hcDTI as a sensitive biomarker of SCI with the potential to improve prognostication and will guide translation to human SCI."
"9271842","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Attaining effective genetically encoded optical voltage-indicators has been a longstanding goal in neuroscience research and is a key near-term aim of the BRAIN Initiative. Unlike small molecule sensors or hybrids of fluorescent proteins with organic molecules, optical voltage-indicators that can be fully encoded genetically are readily combined with genetic tools and viral delivery methods that enable long-term expression and chronic imaging studies without addition of exogenous agents. Genetically encoded Ca2+-sensors offer similar targeting advantages, but Ca2+-imaging fails to reveal individual spikes in many neuron types, poorly captures sub- threshold membrane dynamics, and has insufficient temporal resolution to capture spike timing to better than ~50-100 ms. Voltage-indicators directly sense the membrane potential and promise faithful reporting of spike waveforms, spike bursts and sub-threshold dynamics, in cells targeted by their genetic class or connectivity.  An ideal voltage-indicator would produce large fluorescence responses, to facilitate spike detection, and have millisecond-scale kinetics, to study synchrony and spike-timing aspects of neural coding. However, prior protein voltage-indicators have generally suffered performance-limiting tradeoffs between modest brightness, sluggish kinetics, and limited signaling dynamic range in response to action potentials. To date, no protein voltage-indicator combines the attributes needed for accurate reporting of voltage activity in behaving animals. However, if such a sensor emerged, this would likely have even greater impact on brain science than the surge in research enabled by recent advanced versions of the GCaMP Ca2+-indicator.  This proposal seeks to create broad voltage-imaging capabilities and involves two Co-PDs who are highly experienced in fluorescence imaging of neural activity. Working collaboratively, we recently created two new classes of voltage-indicators, of distinct colors and voltage-sensing mechanisms, each of which has substantially superior signaling fidelity than earlier protein voltage-indicators while offering faster kinetics and higher brightness. Using thes two sensor types, we have imaged fast spike trains in cultured neurons and brain slices. Calculations using signal detection theory show our indicators are now on the brink of transitioning into a mainstay approach to monitor large numbers of individual neurons in behaving animals. To enact this, we will use novel massively parallel methods to screen variants of our protein indicators at 100-1000¿ greater throughput than screening methods used previously in the field. We will validate and iteratively optimize the resulting indicators in cultred neurons, mammalian brain slices, and behaving flies, nematodes and mice, by using signal detection theory to benchmark indicator performance. To accompany these voltage-indicators, we will also create imaging instrumentation custom-designed for high-speed (~1 kHz) voltage-imaging in awake head-restrained and freely behaving mice. If our work succeeds, it will be a game-changer for brain research, propelling studies of how cells and circuits function normally and go awry in disease."
"9172617","DESCRIPTION         Investigator Background: Dr. Kukla holds a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Purdue University (Indianapolis) and is currently a Research Scientist at the VA HSR&D CIEBP. Dr. Kukla has research experience and interest in psychiatric rehabilitation, and particularly, evidence based practices that improve functioning in adults with mental illness. Dr. Kukla's primary area of research interest is enhancing competitive work functioning in veterans with mental illness. Project Background: Veterans with mental illness are more likely to be unemployed than veterans without mental illness and persons in the general population. Consequently, these unemployed veterans often rely on government entitlements and suffer a range of deleterious outcomes. VA supported employment programs, which provide individualized vocational assistance, are partially effective in tackling this unemployment problem. Unfortunately, 40% of persons cannot find work even with this assistance and those who get jobs have difficulty keeping them, as the majority of people experience a job loss within 4 to 8 months. Past studies have linked self-defeating thoughts about one's ability to work and succeed on the job in persons with mental illness working in sheltered work. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated effective in improving other functional domains when combined with psychiatric rehabilitation approaches; however, no prior research has addressed whether CBT may be effectively adapted and applied to improve competitive employment outcomes in veterans with mental illness. Overall Goal: Dr. Kukla's overall goal for this CDA-2 is to acquire the skills and expertise necessary to become a productive independent VA researcher studying and implementing effective ways of enhancing vocational functioning in the community in veterans with mental illness. Specific Goals & Study Design: The proposed research aims to develop an effective and implementable CBT intervention tailored for competitive work functioning in veterans with mental illness. Training goals involve gaining expertise in qualitativ and mixed methods as well as implementation science. 1. Goal 1: Identify the barriers and facilitators to competitive work functioning in veterans with mental illness. The first project phae consists of online surveys and follow-up in-depth phone interviews of supported employment staff from VA medical centers around the country. This mixed methods approach will provide rich data that will help guide the revision and adaptation of the CBT program. 2. Goal 2: Adapt a cognitive behavioral therapy program aimed at improving competitive employment outcomes in veterans with mental illness. This second project phase consists of a formative evaluation used to tailor a CBT program to improve competitive work outcomes. First, the existing CBT intervention will be revised based on the results of staff interviews in Phase 1 and existing empirical literature. Next, two groups of veterans with mental illness will participate in and provide feedback on the 8-week group CBT intervention; the CBT intervention and treatment protocol will be revised after each wave of participants goes through the intervention. 3. Goal 3: Conduct a longitudinal pilot study using the newly adapted CBT program. To test the revised intervention and determine effect sizes in preparation for a large multi-site trial of the intervention, we will compare 25 participants who receive the CBT intervention and are engaged in supported employment services to a control group comprised of 25 participants engaged in supported employment services only. Primary outcomes will include competitive work outcomes (e.g., duration of employment); secondary outcomes will include psychosocial outcomes (e.g., quality of life, symptoms, psychiatric hospitalizations, work-related self-efficacy, work productivity, work effectiveness, veteran satisfaction)."
"9337916","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intraocular pressure (IOP) is arguably the second most important criteria used to assess visual acuity when eye care professionals are diagnosing, treating, and managing patients. The patented Intuor Applanation Tonometer (IAT) prism design is a novel and simple approach for improving the accuracy of IOP measurement in the eye. The proposal describes an inexpensive and easily adoptable approach to improving the accuracy of what has been considered the `gold standard' of IOP measurement for many decades: the Goldmann Applanation Tonometry (GAT). Experts in the field identified significant errors in patient variability in the GAT IOP measurements for corneal thickness, rigidity, curvature, and tear film. The combined error of patient variable parameters is potentially sight threatening to a large population of patients including those with glaucoma or undiagnosed ocular hypertension from other causes. However, currently this is still the best clinical method available. Attempts to develop other IOP correcting tonometers had limited success due to being cumbersome to use and expensive. In contrast, our approach, Intuor Applanation Tonometry (IAT), optimizes the shape of the GAT's prism surface, without any change in measurement technique or examination time, and addresses all known errors in GAT IOP measurements, and accomplishes this with minimal expense (less than $400). Preliminary mathematical modeling of the IAT indicates at least 50% reduction in each error parameter when compared to the GAT, significantly improving the fidelity of IOP measurement. Intuor's novel technology will support the NIH/NEI mission by improving human health and function through maximizing the care provider's ability to more accurately measure the patient's IOP, guiding both individual patient diagnosis and treatment as well as improved global evaluation of disease processes and treatment modalities. The IAT will also reduce healthcare costs through more timely diagnosis and accurate treatment. Intuor Technologies would utilize a Phase I award to accomplish three specific aims: 1. utilize an existing opto-mechanical mathematical model to optimize the design of our IAT, 2. build and verify a working ex-vivo optimized prototype to demonstrate substantial equivalence of the IAT prism to the GAT prism for medical device FDA 510(k) submission, and 3. demonstrate the optimized IAT prototype in-vivo comparing it to the GAT using a true intracameral IOP. Most importantly, after achieving these aims Intuor Technologies will be able to proceed directly to commercialization and marketing."
"9206210","ABSTRACT: Alternative splicing (AS) of human genes is pervasive and greatly expands the repertoire of protein and RNA products arising from the human genome. AS is fundamental to gene and genome function, and its dysregulation has been causally linked with a broad and expanding array of both common and rare diseases and cancers. Despite its central importance, we currently have limited insight into the occurrence and regulation of AS at both the local (gene) and global (genome-wide) levels, due chiefly to a lack of tools that provide direct, high-resolution, and quantitative views into the splicing process. This deficit has in turn roadblocked progress in characterizing the wealth of mutations affecting various components of the splicing machinery now emerging from genetic studies of disease. To date, global studies of splicing have relied chiefly on analysis of mature cytosolic RNA isoforms, which represent the combined result of transcription, splicing, nuclear export and degradation and thus a very incomplete view. For example, at least 1/3rd of splicing events are estimated to go undetected since the resulting RNA product is rapidly targeted for nonsense-mediated decay, and many others go undetected due to limited sensitivity of current sequencing-based approaches. Thus, it is critical to map splicing events rapidly when and where they occur. Here we propose to develop a novel approach that will provide a direct, dynamic, and global window into the alternative splicing of human exons. Our approach enables simultaneous determination of RNA polymerase position and the splicing state of individual RNA molecules. This will in turn open a new kinetic window on splicing that will have uniquely powerful utility for basic mapping and mechanistic studies, and for characterization and functional analysis of mutations affecting the splicing machinery. In Aim 1, we develop an approach that interrogates entire nascent transcripts, to simultaneously map 3' ends as well as the splicing state of the nascent RNA, in a strand-specific manner. We will then develop computational tools to quantify the average distance transcribed by Pol II when splicing occurs, and to integrate these data with average transcription rates and high resolution Pol II mapping to reveal mean splicing times ? thus opening a new and global window into splicing kinetics. This approach has a temporal resolution of tens of milliseconds that greatly eclipses other strategies to measure splicing kinetics, such as metabolic labeling of nascent RNA. In Aim 2, we apply this approach to characterize the global effects of recurrent mutations in 2 splicing regulators found in malignancies. An unexpected discovery from cancer genome sequencing studies has been the identification of frequent mutations in genes encoding splicing machinery components. As proof-of-principle for complex biological applications, we propose to apply our approach to characterize and gain functional insights into mutations in splicing regulators characteristic of several major malignancies. Our comprehensive approach for measuring global splicing kinetics has the positive impact of enabling rapid discovery and characterization of splicing regulation in health and disease."
"9054243","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By encapsulating therapeutic agents within biodegradable nanoparticles, it is possible to provide long-lasting delivery of molecules that are otherwise rapidly cleared or degraded. The purpose of this proposal is to continue evaluation and development of a nanoparticle platform with which to deliver antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (nano-SOD/CAT) to treat retinal diseases. Oxidative damage mediated via reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important driving force in photoreceptor degeneration as occurs in human retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). We have found that systemic delivery (intraperitoneal injection) of nano-SOD/CAT significantly slows the rate of photoreceptor cell death in a widely used very aggressive model of human RP - the Pdeb6rd10 (rd10) mouse. To build upon these promising results, we will test the hypothesis that nano-SOD/CAT is effective in slowing the rate of photoreceptor cell death for many genetic forms of RP and can be developed as a chronic therapy to slow down disease progression. In Aim 1, we will define the optimal dose of nano-SOD/CAT, determine which treatment schedule provides the best results, and will also examine whether the beneficial effect of nano-SOD/CAT application is dependent upon the age (disease stage) when treatment begins. In all of these studies, we will evaluate retinal function using electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and retinal structure using light microscopy and by counting the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. In Aim 2, we will inhibit two pathways that play major roles in cellular events initiated by oxidative stress. These studies will use the same outcome measures as Aim 1, and will clarify the mechanism(s) by which nano-SOD/CAT mediated reduction in ROS leads to preservation of photoreceptors. In Aim 3, we will expand this research strategy to three additional mouse models. While human RP is caused by mutations in more than 50 genes, mutations in rhodopsin and peripherin/rds account for a sizeable fraction of affected patients. Therefore, we will determine whether nano-SOD/CAT will slow the degenerative phenotype in three mouse models for autosomal recessive or dominant RP due to Rho or Prhp2 mutations. These mouse models were chosen due to their underlying genetics and their distinct rates of photoreceptor cell loss, all of which are slower than that seen in the rd10 model. Aim 3 will thus provide important information about the general potential for nano-SOD/CAT to slow the rate of photoreceptor degeneration in multiple genetic forms of RP with distinct phenotypes which are also commonly seen in humans. Although nano-SOD/CAT will not correct the underlying genetic defect, significant disease slowing would be meaningful, by allowing affected patients, particularly children to retain useful vision for a substantially longer period of time and potentilly throughout their lifetime."
"9230158","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Teich, Andrew Franklin Project Summary: This is a training grant that will give me the resources to develop into an academic physician-scientist. My long- term goal is to do research that focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegenerative diseases of the aging brain, and integrate this with my clinical role as a neuropathologist (with at least 75% of my time dedicated to research). This grant has a scientific proposal component as well as a training component. The scientific proposal component will ask two questions. First, I will ask if there are differences in gene methylation between AD patients and cognitively normal patients with a similar cortical ?-amyloid load (?pathological controls?). AD patients have been shown to have abnormalities in DNA methylation, and ?- amyloid has also been shown to cause alterations in DNA methylation. However, ?pathologic controls? have elevated ?-amyloid levels but are not demented. Since pathologic controls have elevated ?-amyloid levels, and ?-amyloid has been shown to cause altered DNA methylation, pathologic controls may have some DNA methylation abnormalities normally associated with AD that do not directly cause dementia. By comparing AD brain tissue to pathological control tissue, I hope to tease out changes in gene methylation that correlate strongest with the presence of dementia. Second, I will ask whether there are changes in DNA methylation that are predictive of worsening cognitive status in the setting of AD pathology, using a patient population that is being shunted for hydrocephalus. In all, these experiments will help to tease out the association of abnormal DNA methylation with impaired cognition in AD. My PhD thesis was in a computational neuroscience lab (i.e. ?dry-lab? work). I have spent the last several years after my clinical training becoming proficient in experimental neuroscience (i.e. ?wet-lab? work). This training grant will take advantage of this background and train me in computational techniques of analyzing genomic and genome expression data, with a focus on applying these techniques to neurodegeneration and the aging brain. In addition, this training grant is coinciding with my elevation to Co-Director of the New York Brain Bank at Columbia University. I will accomplish four training goals during the course of this grant; 1) Acquire a skill set to facilitate my new leadership role at Columbia, 2) Acquire the skills to perform computational analysis of genomic and genome expression data, 3) Deepen my knowledge of aging biology, 4) Acquire skills to succeed in writing my first R01 grant. In summary, this training grant, through the scientific proposal and the training plan, will give me the resources to flourish as a scientist and make a contribution to Alzheimer's disease research. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12) Page Continuation Format Page"
"9160161","ABSTRACT  For the past 15 years, we have chronicled the development of over 600 primarily low-income, first- generation Latino children born in the Salinas Valley, known as ?the nation's salad bowl.? The children of the CHAMACOS longitudinal birth cohort are now coming of age in a community identified by the Department of Justice as an epicenter of youth gang violence. Our previous research has shown that in utero exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs) was associated with impaired attention3 and lower IQ at school age for CHAMACOS children,4 both of which are risk factors for adverse behavioral outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Our data also indicate that CHAMACOS children have experienced considerable early life stressors, including poverty, food insecurity, housing instability, household overcrowding, family conflict and separation, maternal depression, and fear of deportation that may predispose them to adverse outcomes. We propose to investigate the interaction of in utero exposure to a host of neurotoxic pesticides with early life social adversity in association with behavioral outcomes during the transition from adolescence to early adulthood (age 16 and ~18 years): specifically, externalizing and risk-taking behaviors, delinquent and criminal activities, and school failure versus success/graduation.  Through our research, we will investigate developmental outcomes of exposure to the complex mixture of pesticides used in Salinas Valley agriculture, making use of geo-coded that allows assessment of chemicals that lack biomarkers. We will also collaborate with child development Pesticide Use Reporting data (PUR) experts to synthesize the wealth of data we have gathered on family-level and neighborhood-level adversities (e.g. poverty, crime) into cumulative adversity exposure variables corresponding to specific developmental windows (i.e. in utero, birth to age 5, and birth to age 9), and will do the same for protective factors (e.g. maintenance of positive cultural values, child-parent attachment).  We hypothesize that exposure to neurotoxic pesticides and early life adversity will each independently increase adverse behavioral outcomes in adolescence/early adulthood, and that early adversity may modify the effects of pesticide exposures. We further suggest that the decreased cognitive abilities and poorer attention observed in association with pesticide exposure in CHAMACOS children at school age may mediate this relationship. Thus, the goal of this project is to evaluate the neurotoxicity of current-use pesticides and early social adversity to human populations, assess effects of early life exposure to both these chemical and non-chemical stressors on adolescent/early adult behaviors of societal concern, and identify targets for early intervention to prevent longer term poor outcomes."
"9135155","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      After traumatic injury to peripheral nerves, recovery is poor. The current standard of care is coaptation of the proximal and distal ends of the nerve, or if the gap between the two ends is too large, the use of autologous nerve grafts. The insufficiencies of donor nerve in both diameter and number of available nerves has led to the development of nerve guidance channels, engineered constructs including both artificial and natural materials. However, most designs still underperform compared to autografts because they lack Schwann cells, the glial, or support cells of peripheral nerve. These cells deliver growth factors, substrate glycoproteins, and topographical cues that potentiate axon regeneration following injury, and nerve guidance channels that possess Schwann cells outperform those that lack them.  One of the recent advances in guidance channel design is the incorporation of longitudinally aligned, electrospun fibers on the cell-length scale that direct the growth of regenerating axons by contact guidance. Electrospinning is a method of fabricating nano- and microfibers that resemble native extracellular matrix, and the development of these biomimetic constructs has accelerated advances in engineering of multiple tissue types. Combining the directional guidance of micro- and nanofibers by pre-seeding them with Schwann cells seems a straightforward strategy, but electrospun fiber matrices are disadvantaged by small pore sizes that limit the depth of cell penetration to only one or two cell diameters, leaving much of the electrospun matrix devoid of cells.  Here we propose solving this problem by developing a means to integrate Schwann cells into fibers produced by a process similar to electrospinning, called jetting. Jetting eliminates th high forces that reduce cell viability when electrospinning cells into fibers. If successful, this process would disperse cells evenly throughout an aligned-fiber matrix. The goal of this project is to provide scientific evidence needed to allow for the rational development of microfibers with integrated Schwann cells. In specific aim 1, we fabricate and test a novel side-by-side biphasic fiber design. One layer encapsulates Schwann cells as the fiber is made and rapidly degrades to release them. The second layer, produced simultaneously in this biphasic jetting process, degrades much more slowly and remains to provide a topographical cue to the released cells. Fiber morphology, diameter, degradation, and cell viability and proliferation are tested at all stages of development. In aim 2, we test the ability of scaffolds containing prototype fibers with integrated Schwann cells to improve regeneration in a sciatic nerve gap injury model. After 1.5 or 4 months have elapsed following implantation, the number of transplanted versus native Schwann cells in each graft is determined. Then the number of axons and the distance they have grown in is assessed and compared to grafts containing both autologous nerve and aligned electrospun fibers.  It is hoped that this project will serve to develop an enabling technology toward the improvement regeneration in the nervous system."
"9239284","Project Summary Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the most common cause of diarrhea, afflicting millions of children in the developing world. However, the true burden of ETEC in young children and the role of acquired immunity remains poorly understood. Accurate estimates in different geographic regions will highlight the public health importance of a vaccine, and these data are critically important to reduce the burden and to facilitate vaccine development. A significant challenge to successful vaccine development is our poor understanding of the immune responses that correlate best with protection against ETEC illness. A better understanding of the interplay between local and serum responses to various ETEC strains in non-immune and immune subjects is needed since these data will provide important immunological benchmarks for the evaluation of ETEC vaccines and immunization regimens in the future. We propose to add studies of ETEC to an already NIH-funded newborn cohort study of norovirus and sapovirus infection in a peri-urban Lima community, where we have conducted child cohort studies for more than 20 years. By leveraging this study, we can gain information about ETEC at a fraction of the cost were it a stand-alone study. To facilitate this proposed work, we are collaborating with a JHU ETEC research team, which provides access to expertise and state-of-the-art techniques to evaluate ETEC disease and naturally-acquired immunity. As in the parent study, we will follow the infants through a longitudinal community cohort to fully understand the natural immunity to a disease that infects young infants multiple times early in life. We will address the knowledge gap of ETEC epidemiology and immune response in young children by addressing issues key to effective vaccine design and deployment: we will quantify the genotype-specific ETEC incidence and morbidity, and we will evaluate acquisition of protective immunity by correlating host blood group antigen, secretor status, and ETEC antigen specific antibodies in serum, fecal matter, and saliva with ETEC disease, infection, and shedding. Specific Aim 1. Characterize the epidemiology of ETEC in Peruvian children by conducting a longitudinal cohort study from birth to age 3 years including systematic collection of data and specimens. Specific Aim 2. Evaluate acquired protective immunity to ETEC in a setting of frequent exposure in a subset of cohort children."
"9221192","Heterogeneity is a hallmark of tumors and has a crucial role in the outcome of the malignancy, because it not only confounds diagnosis, but also challenges the design of effective therapies. Much attention has been placed on tumors as architecturally heterogeneous systems that differ regionally in vasculature, host infiltrates, and connective tissue components, but far less is known about bioenergetic heterogeneity and how cancer cells dependent on different bioenergetic pathways interact together to drive tumor growth. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that glycolytic chemosensitive glioma cells inhibit the expansion and growth of Oxphos-dependent chemoresistant glioma cells through a paracrine mechanism involving secreted insulin growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6). Two aims are proposed to: 1) Characterize the paracrine pathway between glycolytic chemosensitive cells and Oxphos- dependent chemoresistant cells, and 2) Determine the effect of TMZ treatment on the enrichment of Oxphos-dependent chemoresistant cells. In both aims, we will use genetic and pharmacologic approaches in human cell lines and patient?derived xenoline models. The work proposed is expected to identify a novel paracrine pathway between Oxphos-dependent chemoresistant and glycolytic chemosensitive glioma cells and demonstrate that standard of care TMZ, by interrupting this paracrine regulation, expands the pool of chemoresistant cells, leading to increased tumorigenicity. If successful, this study will define a novel tumor growth model where by intratumoral bioenergetic heterogeneity is critically involved in the growth of the tumor as a whole. Importantly, we propose that standard treatment modalities may selectively destroy this structured population and facilitate subsequent progression. Consequently, controlling tumor progression by maintaining rather than destroying this suppressive tumor layer may be more effective than conventional high-dose density therapy that aims to kill the maximum possible number of tumor cells."
"9180214","PROJECT SUMMARY Development, maintenance and plasticity of presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendritic spines are essential for learning and memory and require proper regulation of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. Tau is a microtubule associated protein (MAP) that binds to and stabilizes MTs but also interacts with actin filaments and may regulate actin/MT interaction. However, the normal functions of tau at the synapse are not well understood, which has hampered our understanding of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD) memory loss and cognitive decline are caused by synaptic loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The major hallmarks of AD are abnormal tau phosphorylation and accumulation of amyloid-?. In animal models hyperphosphorylated tau, mislocalized to postsynaptic hippocampal dendritic spines, caused impaired memory, synaptic dysfunction and disruption of physiological synaptic plasticity, even in the absence of overt neurodegeneration and spine loss. Phosphorylated tau also propagates transynaptically, causing presynaptic axon degeneration and synaptic loss. In cell free systems tau phosphorylation detaches tau from MTs, thereby decreasing MT stability and increasing MT dynamics. However, this has not been documented in living neurons. Thus it is not known whether a decrease in tau-MT binding induced by tau phosphorylation could contribute to impaired synaptic plasticity through changes in MT and actin dynamics. Given the importance of tau pathology in AD it will be important to address this question in human neurons expressing human forms of tau. Therefore, in this proposal we will use cortical neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from normal subjects and from patients with AD to determine the role of tau phosphorylation in plasticity of pre and postsynaptic structures. We will ask how tau binding to the cytoskeleton regulates MT and actin dynamics in presynaptic axon terminals (using growth cones as a model) and postsynaptic dendritic spines of these neurons during plasticity induced by growth factors. We will determine how changes in tau phosphorylation affect interaction of tau with the MT and actin cytoskeleton and how these interactions regulate dynamic cytoskeletal reorganization required for structural plasticity of neuronal growth cones and dendritic spines. Results from this work will not only provide new information about the normal function of tau in synaptic plasticity of human neurons but also shed light on how abnormal tau phosphorylation may contribute to altered plasticity in AD."
"9142379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelin is a fundamental component of mature neural networks that is affected in a large number of pathological conditions of the central nervous system (CNS). Critical for advancing knowledge about these conditions would be a better in vivo understanding of how oligodendrocytes and their respective myelin sheaths develop, are maintained throughout life and respond to injury. Growing evidence suggests neuronal activity and proper astrocyte function may play crucial roles in these processes. We have developed a new technique that allows high resolution label-free in vivo imaging of myelinated axons. This technique takes advantage of the high refractive index of lipid rich multilayered myelin and is based on spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe) microscopy. Using SCoRe imaging I have obtained for the first time long-term images of the dynamics of cortical myelin on the cellular scale in a living animal. Preliminary data shows this technique as well as fluorescence imaging of oligodendrocytes, axons and astrocytes are a powerful set of tools that in combination provide a wealth of information about fine structural dynamics of these structures in vivo. I demonstrate the feasibility to track long- term changes in internode length in addition to documenting the temporal dynamics of demyelination after single oligodendrocyte and astrocyte ablation. I propose to use these powerful techniques to address three fundamental questions concerning the in vivo plasticity and regeneration of myelin and oligodendrocytes. First, I will determine the long term plasticity of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the mouse cortex. Next I will determine the effects of neuronal activity on myelin formation, plasticity and oligodendrocyte  regeneration. Finally I will use single cell ablation techniques to determine if astrocytes are required for or alter the temporal dynamics of oligodendrocyte remyelination in vivo. Together these experiments will describe for the first time the longitudinal dynamics and regeneration capabilities of oligodendrocytes and myelin on the cellular scale. Furthermore these experiments will reveal how changes in axons and astrocytes influence these dynamics over weeks to months in the living brain."
"9211776","Rationale: The overall goal of this application is to advance the science of diagnostic error reduction. Diagnostic error (defined as the failure to provide the patient with an accurate and timely diagnosis or to communicate that explanation to the patient) is an important, common, and costly problem. These errors and their impact on patient outcomes, however, have been underemphasized until recently. Increased attention is now being paid to the problem as evidenced by the publication of the Institute of Medicine report Improving Diagnosis in Health Care. Much, however, remains to be learned about the best way to identify and measure these errors as well as what interventions are most likely to prevent them. Understanding the complex origins of diagnostic errors requires a multidisciplinary approach that coordinates the input of clinicians, educators, human factors experts, and cognitive scientists, as well as participation of important stakeholders such as payers, patient advocates, and accrediting/credentialing organizations. Previous Conferences and Impact: Previous conferences, all supported by AHRQ, provided forums for groundbreaking research as well as a means of bringing together researchers and experts to focus on issues that lie at the intersection of diagnostic reasoning and medical error. These prior meetings have had a significant impact on the field as a whole including the formation of a new organization (Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine) and the publication of multiple high-impact and influential papers. Conference Plan: The conference will be a 3.5-day meeting. The first day will center on summits designed to bring together key leaders in specific areas of the study of diagnostic error with research, patient and educational summits all planned. The subsequent conference will focus on the impact of the IOM report, including discussion and dissemination of the advances that have improved diagnostic performance and patient safety following the IOM report. There will be a concentration on promulgating interventions demonstrated to effect an improvement in diagnostic safety. An emphasis will placed on sharing research advances and delineating a research agenda. Attention will also be devoted to procurement of grants and funding, and promoting research capacity. Speakers will be internationally recognized leaders from diverse disciplines including cognitive psychology, patient engagement, educational reform and patient safety. Impact/ Deliverables: The conference will provide a forum to establish research priorities in the field, develop educational curricula and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The ultimate goal of the conference is the development and dissemination of strategies to reduce diagnostic errors that may be widely implemented."
"9144334","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a frequent, but preventable complication for hospitalized patients that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It has been estimated that more than 900,000 VTE cases occur in the US every year. A range of VTE prevention interventions have been evaluated, such as electronic reminders and clinical decision support (CDS) for VTE risk assessment. Health information (IT) may provide an opportunity for improving the prevention and management of VTE. However, studies of electronic alerts based on computerized VTE risk assessment have produced limited benefits. These studies have been restricted to high-risk patients, have focused on prophylaxis (i.e. VTE prevention) with little or no consideration for VTE diagnosis and treatment (i.e. VTE management), and have not addressed sociotechnical challenges related to CDS design identified in numerous reports. We propose to use a sociotechnical systems approach to the design of health IT specifically for preventing and managing VTE; this approach can address the range of sociotechnical system issues that have limited the effectiveness of health IT for VTE. Using the SEIPS model and the human factors multi-level system model, we will develop a deep understanding of the cognitive and team work involved in VTE prevention and management, and then use the outputs of this analysis to define sociotechnical design requirements for a CDS that supports cognitive and team work for preventing and managing VTE. Our specific aims are: (1) to evaluate the cognitive and team work involved in VTE prevention and management; and (2) to develop design requirements for a CDS that supports cognitive and team work for preventing and managing VTE. The study will be conducted in four hospitals of an integrated healthcare system. Methods for analyzing cognitive and team work will be diverse (i.e. observation, interview, focus group and survey) (Aim 1) and will produce a range of outputs (e.g., decision ladders, process map, information flow diagram) that will be used to define the CDS design requirements (Aim 2). Using a collaborative process between the human factors engineers and the physicians on the research team, we will develop preliminary design requirements that will be embedded in CDS mock-ups; the CDS mock-ups will then be evaluated through scenario-based usability evaluation and group debriefings. The results of this analysis will help to define additional questions to address in the data collection for Aim 1. When all Aim 1 data have been collected and analyzed, we will finalize the CDS design requirements (Aim 2). This research focuses on VTE, but the broader objective is to develop an approach to design health IT applications for healthcare quality and safety problems that can benefit from improved integration of guidelines in clinical workflows. This study is significant and innovative because we are (a) addressing a common, but preventable complication, i.e. VTE; (b) using a sociotechnical systems approach and human factors principles and methods to design health IT; and (c) involving a highly experienced multidisciplinary team of human factors engineers and physicians."
"9150492","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in eliminating health disparities requires interdisciplinary efforts among social and biological scientists, and population-based data sets through which complex hypotheses linking environmental, psychosocial, behavioral and biological processes can be tested. The proposed project is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort integrating expertise in population health disparities, molecular biology, and the statisticl impact of measurement error on parameter estimates directly pertinent to population health research. We will address the question of whether DNA from blood or saliva banked with large population based data sets is valid for use in population health studies of telomere length (TL) - an intriguing new biomeasure of stress- mediated health, development, and aging -- and, if so, what sample sizes are needed.  Research on population differences in TL is largely based on highly select, racially homogeneous, clinical, or convenience samples. Socioeconomic measures are often absent or rudimentary. The state-of-the-art approach to measuring TL is via leukocyte-derived DNA extracted from fresh venous blood samples. Launching new population-based data collection activities that include blood draws, molecular measurements and the broad swath of social, environmental, behavioral, and health variables needed is costly and takes years before data can be analyzed. However, extant population-based data collections are increasingly isolating blood DNA for storage in specimen repositories after the cells have been transformed and immortalized using Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) or storing DNA in saliva. Neither approach is ideal for TL measurement. The critical unanswered question for population research is whether the error introduced in these TL measures is random or systematic with respect to original TL or to populations of interest.  We propose to estimate the validity of using EBV-immortalized blood cells or saliva cells to estimate population differences in TL. We will collect blood and saliva from 150 adult black, white, or Mexican-origin women in Detroit and Ann Arbor and measure each woman's TL multiple times using DNA directly isolated from fresh blood cells, DNA isolated from cells that we will EBV- immortalize, and DNA extracted from saliva. By stratifying the sample along key axes of comparison - race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, stress- level, and neighborhood - and making within-woman comparisons on TL between immortalized and fresh blood samples, and between fresh blood samples and saliva, we will directly gauge the effect that immortalization or tissue type has on the validity and reliability o findings from TL studies that use stored specimens and on the future potential use of stored specimens for testing interdisciplinary hypotheses on population health disparities. Findings can be applied toward increasing the pace of health disparities research, whatever the conclusion on the validity of using immortalized blood or saliva cells to measure TL."
"9341653","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose a research-training program to prepare an independent young investigator focused on understanding the genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders. The candidate has expertise in the use of next generation sequencing technologies to identify coding variations that cause genetic disease, these skills will be applied to addressing the role of noncoding DNA variation in epilepsy. Epilepsy affects 1 in 26 individuals across the globe, including ~22 million people in the US alone. The epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) are the most severe of all epilepsies and most do not respond to current treatments, necessitating the need for novel therapeutic interventions. The first step towards designing new treatments is to identify the genetic mutations that cause this disorder. Significant progress has been made in this regard; a quarter of patients with EE have causative de novo mutations in the protein-coding regions of over 20 genes. However, while a number of genes are yet to be identified, these coding mutations are unlikely to account for all remaining cases. Recent studies, including the NIH-funded ENCODE project, have demonstrated the importance of noncoding elements in controlling how and when genes are expressed. We hypothesize that noncoding mutations cause EE by disrupting the expression of target genes that are important in neurogenesis. The most unbiased way to detect all noncoding genetic variation in the human genome is to perform whole- genome sequencing, this technique will likely be prevalent in the future of genetics. However, a major challenge to its success lies in ou ability to differentiate between the functional causal noncoding mutation and the millions of non-pathogenic variants identified. This challenge requires an understanding of how noncoding elements control gene expression during neurogenesis and neuronal function. This training program implements the use of epigenomic data and interpretation to identify important noncoding DNA regions in EE. Dr. Mefford is an expert in human molecular genetics research and has made a significant contribution to the understanding of genetic mutation in neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy. Dr. Mefford will serve as primary mentor for the scientific and professional development of the candidate. Moreover, the candidate has assembled an advisory committee of experts in the fields in which she requires training and mentorship; Dr. Stamatoyannopoulos will support generation of epigenomic data, as well as establishing novel computational pipelines for interpretation, Dr. Shendure will advise in the development of a novel targeted RNA expression methodology, and Dr. Doherty will assist in neuronal cellular differentiation techniques. Moreover, the Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, has an excellent track record of assisting fellows' transition to independence. Overall, the University of Washington School of Medicine is an ideal setting for acquiring new research skills, performing didactic training and benefiting from excellent mentorship from field leaders towards becoming a successful independent investigator. This career award will allow the candidate to develop a framework to identify candidate EE noncoding regions, using the genes that we have already defined as causes of EE as a model. First by identifying the neuronal- specific cis-regulatory regions around known EE genes. Second, using CHD2 as a model, we will identify the noncoding DNA targets of this protein, and examine how the function of these noncoding regions is affected by CHD2 loss. Together these noncoding DNA regions move towards the development of a 'regulatory epileptogenesis atlas' for prioritizing variants from whole-genome sequencing studies. This experimental model can rapidly be applied to other genes that cause neurodevelopmental disorders, contributing more broadly to our understanding of disease and laying the foundation for the candidate's independent research plan."
"9253597","Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to your limbs, thereby restricting blood flow. During exercise or simply walking there is not sufficient blood flow to keep up with the metabolic demand. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (intermittent claudication). PAD is also likely to be a sign of more widespread atherosclerosis which may be reducing blood flow to your heart and brain and other parts of the body, and not be isolated to just the legs. Therefore, improving blood flow to the legs in patients with PAD will likely improve blood flow to other organs as well. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) availability, or endothelial dysfunction, is a hallmark of a number of cardiovascular disorders including PAD. L-Arginine is the precursor of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, an endogenous vasodilator. L-Arginine supplementation improves vascular reactivity and functional capacity in PAD in small, short-term studies. However, long-term administration of L-arginine does not increase nitric oxide synthesis or improve vascular reactivity. As opposed to its short-term administration, long-term administration of L-arginine is not useful in patients with intermittent claudication and PAD. The objective of this application is to determine if restoring NO through an orally disintegrating tablet that releases authentic NO gas can improve blood flow and intermittent claudication in patients with PAD. The central hypothesis of this application is that a nitric oxide generating tablet can dilate blood vessels, improve blood vascular reactivity and functional capacity in patients with PAD. This same technology has already been shown to dilate blood vessels, improve vascular reactivity and functional capacity in hypertensive and pre-hypertensive patients. If successful, this non-prescription over the counter formulation can provide a safe, effective and affordable solution for patients with PAD and perhaps improve long- term outcomes in patients with vascular disorders."
"9224605","PROJECT SUMMARY The introduction of large-scale genomic testing in medicine promises to transform patient care. Cancer is at the leading edge of this revolution and hundreds of thousands of cancer patients receive tumor genomic testing yearly. Despite rapid adoption of genomic testing in cancer, many patients fail to comprehend basic genetic concepts and the defining genomic characteristics of their disease. Given that better-informed patients can more effectively engage in their care, and that greater knowledge is associated with improved cancer-related outcomes, there are significant concerns that patients' genomic knowledge deficits will contribute to poor quality care and outcomes. In this context there is an urgent need to educate patients about cancer genomics generally, and their sequencing results specifically, in a format that is usable, useful, and that easily integrates into existing clinical workflows. We propose to address this gap in care quality by identifying patients' needs for sequencing information and using that knowledge to design a dynamic, patient-facing, web-based cancer genome sequencing report that will integrate with the electronic health record (Aim 1). During the design process, we will elicit input from cancer patients, family members and clinicians to ensure that the web report is useful, usable, and that it easily integrates into clinical workflows. In the second phase, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering sequencing results and genomic education via the web report to cancer patients treated in academic and community settings (Aim 2). On completion of this project, we will be well positioned to test the effectiveness of the web-based patient sequencing report in a full-scale implementation trial. We hypothesize that when the web report is used to augment the return of cancer genome sequencing results, 1) it will increase patients' knowledge, their ability to actively participate in care, and their ability to share genomic information with family members; 2) it will increase oncologists' recommendations for genomically targeted therapies; and 3) it will improve patient-provider communication, care satisfaction and the efficiency of care delivery. This pilot and feasibility health IT project, addressing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Design Research Area, will leverage the IT network that we have developed which stores genome- sequencing data; generates dynamic, physician-directed reports; and matches patients to relevant clinical trials. Our commitment to open source development will allow universal access to the source code and facilitate widespread dissemination of the web-based patient sequencing report and IT network. By providing patients with direct access to their sequencing results, we aim to ensure that they understand the essential genomic characteristics of their disease and give them the knowledge that they need to actively participate in cancer care decisions. If successful, the project will facilitate patient engagement in care and serve as a critical step forward in the goal to improve the quality of cancer care delivery."
"9144767","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to mature as an independent health services researcher, with a focus on quality and palliative care, to improve the experience of patients with serious and chronic illness and their caregivers. Palliative care is a newer clinical discipline focused on improving quality of life for all patients, independent of prognosis. Palliative care has achieved remarkable growth, with clinical services present in 66% of all hospitals. Despite such growth, a standardized clinical approach does not yet exist. Such an approach requires evaluating which care processes, recommended by published quality measures, improve patient-centered outcomes the most. Then, the care processes and associated quality measures with the greatest impact can be prioritized. We have developed the infrastructure to perform this investigation. Specifically, I led the development of QDACT-PC (Quality Data Collection Tool Palliative Care), a point-of-care, iPad(tm)-based data collection system that simultaneously populates a registry of care processes, quality measure adherence, and patient and health system outcomes. In September 2013, we were awarded an AHRQ R18 grant to implement QDACT-PC nationally in the Palliative Care Research Cooperative Group (PCRC), the first national research collaborative for palliative care. Analysis aims were reserved by my mentor and the PI of that proposal, Dr. Amy Abernethy, for this K08 application. My research goal is to use this quickly growing registry to explore the impact of quality measure adherence on outcomes in the palliative care setting. Under the guidance of my mentors, I will first, I will describe variability in clinician adherence to a set of 20 core palliative care qualiy measures among 1000 patients. Then, I will use quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the relationship between adherence to a set of palliative care quality measures and patient-reported outcomes, including satisfaction with care, quality of life, and symptom relief. Last, I will investigate the relationship between adherence to a set of quality measures and health service utilization, as measured by 30-day readmission rates, length of stay, and overall health care costs. Together, these aims alongside a robust career development plan and dedicated mentorship, will prepare me for an R01-level submission prospectively testing the identified core set on patient-centered outcomes."
"9137504","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To stimulate health system transformation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the State Innovation Model (SIM) Initiative, which since 2013, has invested more than 1 billion dollars in state efforts to plan, piot test, and implement payment and delivery system reforms. The SIM Initiative is an ongoing, naturally occurring federal-state policy intervention that provides financial and technical support to states for development and testing state-led multi-payer health care payment and service delivery models. The goals of this federal-state program are to improve health system performance, improve the quality of patient care, and decrease health care costs for all residents of the state. As states are investing in transformational restructuring of incentives and  delivery systems, the SIM Initiative is anticipated to improve health status overall, including diabetes risk and health status in large segments of the community. In order to achieve SIM Initiative goals, most SIM states are focusing on chronic illness, in general, and diabetes, in particular. We propose a natural experiment rigorously designed to optimize the ability to draw causal inferences. Using diverse data from multiple sources we will assess this population-targeted policy to assess outcomes at multiple levels, including state, county, and physician organization and delivery system levels. From 2015 to 2019, we will monitor and track payment and delivery system reforms relevant to preventing, and managing complications of, diabetes. This will be done for 18 purposively sampled states: 6 Round 1 states, 6 Round 2 states, and 6 waiting control states. Using these policy data, we will develop a taxonomy of state SIM implementation to empirically examine how SIM implementation affects practice implementation of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model and participation in accountable care organizations (ACOs). We will use propensity score matching of patients in a stepped wedge research design to examine the impact of the staged implementation of SIM plans across the states. We will estimate the impact of the SIM Initiative on diabetes-related health behaviors (2011-2018) and hospitalizations due to diabetes (2011-2017) for Round 1 vs. Round 2 vs. waiting control states. The influence of delivery system and payment reform activities implemented as part of each states' SIM plan will be explored. Finally, we estimate the economic impact of the SIM Initiative's improvements in diabetes care prevention and management and explore heterogeneity in economic impacts across SIM states. The proposed collaborative project will yield actionable data and analyses to state and local health officials, and public health and health care delivery stakeholders on the impact of the SIM Initiative on improvements on diabetes prevention and management."

"9232346","Project Summary Factors controlling cell shape are crucial to cellular function. This is especially so in neurons, which need to extend axons over long distances in order to connect with their appropriate synaptic partners. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (EphRs) and their cognate ephrin ligands play key roles in many aspects of nervous system development and are particularly important for axon targeting. How EphRs and ephrins govern the final shape of a neuron and its subsequent synaptic connections is not well understood. We propose to investigate this using the nematode C. elegans as a tractable model for these studies. The C. elegans genome contains only a single EphA receptor and four ephrin-A genes, which greatly simplifies analysis of EphR/ephrin function. Also, the entire nervous system architecture has been determined, allowing one to make predictions of neuron function in response to changes in cell shape. Non-invasive optogenetic tools have been developed that allow the physiological stimulation of single neurons. Similarly, Ca2+-sensitive GFP and RFP variants have been developed allowing one to record changes in Ca2+ dynamics in response to stimuli. Finally, C. elegans exhibits specific behaviors, allowing us to understanding the consequences of cell shape change or physiology at the behavioral level. We recently identified novel roles for the C. elegans EphR gene vab-1, and it's ephrin ligand, efn-4 in controlling AIY interneuron shape. These cells function as a left-right pair and are required for the transduction of thermosensory information. Electron microscopy reveals that the AIYL and AIYR cells make a gap junction contact in the dorsal side of the nerve ring. Our fluorescence reporter data also reveals physical contact between AIYL and R on the ventral side of the nerve ring. Whether these contact points are required for normal AIY function is not known. We propose a genetic approach to assaying the role of AIY morphology in their physiology and behavior. efn-4 mutations cause defects in axon outgrowth, preventing the AIY cells from making dorsal contact. Conversely, efn-1 mutations prevent the AIY cells from making contact on the ventral side of the nerve ring. We hypothesize that AIYL/R communication will be blocked in one or more ephrin mutants. This also suggests that AIY-based behaviors such as isothermal movement will be compromised. This has important implications for predicting and modeling neural circuit function. Our approach will be broadly applicable to investigating the molecular, cellular and behavioral consequences of other genes involved in neural development. The strong conservation of neural function between C. elegans and humans indicates that information gained from a simple model system will have direct influence on the understanding of human neurodevelopmental disorders. This project directly addresses fundamental mechanisms in developmental neurobiology, and will accomplish both broad and specific AREA program goals, including enhancing Kennesaw State University's research environment and exposing students to high quality research through direct participation."
"9134737","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to obtain funds for the training of PhD scientists committed to academic careers that have a research focus integrating the interaction between nutrition and metabolism. More specifically to understand, prevent, and treat metabolic diseases which include diabetes, obesity and associated complications, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and kidney disease. The importance of training future researchers in these areas is evident due to the growing epidemic of these disorders in the United States.  The rationale for this proposal is based on the firm belief that nutrition is one of the most significant, if not the significant environmental factor that may be modified to prevent, delay or ameliorate obesity and metabolic disorders. This proposal therefore seeks funds to train the next generation of nutrition research investigators to address an understanding of metabolism and metabolic dysfunction at the molecular, cellular, whole body and/or population levels. Support is requested for five pre-doctoral training slots for each of the proposed five years.  All trainees are first admitted to a graduate degree program at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, located on the Health Science Campus of Tufts University, and, after one year of coursework and laboratory rotations are eligible to be admitted to the the proposed training program. Acceptance into the training program is predicated upon outstanding academic and research achievement during the first year. Each of the faculty mentors have appointments within the Health Science Campus and will provide exemplary research training to pre-doctoral students interested in the broad research areas of obesity, diabetes, metabolism, digestive diseases, endocrinology, genomics and gene therapy, epidemiology, and related diseases of the kidney and pancreas."
"9177428","PROJECT SUMMARY  Multiple human neurological disorders are associated with deficits in social interaction and communication. Although a genetic component of these disorders is well established, their inheritance is complex, and the identification of functional connections between disease loci and impaired behaviors has proven to be extremely difficult. Integration of human genetic studies with studies of animal models will facilitate advances in establishing the comprehensive molecular networks that regulate social behaviors and the identification of gene pathways disrupted in mental disorders.  The goals of this project are to dissect specific heritable behaviors segregating in the silver fox (Vulpes vulpes) into discrete interacting components that are understood at the molecular level with the intent of providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying a broad range of mammalian interactive social behaviors, including human psychiatric disorders. The specific fox strains developed at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (ICG) of the Russian Academy of Sciences exhibit markedly different, genetically determined behavioral phenotypes with significant parallels to typical and atypical human behaviors. The current proposal is a joint research project between scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the ICG, and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences to define the molecular mechanisms underlying these behavioral phenotypes.  To investigate the genetics of these behaviors we will 1) identify and compare the genetic architecture of aggressive, anxiety-related, and affiliative behaviors in foxes and 2) fine map fox behavioral loci and define candidate genes and molecular pathways involved in the regulation of these behaviors. The identification of loci and genes influencing social behavior in foxes is expected to provide new insights into, and candidate genes for, human disorders of social behavior. Furthermore, such a well-established large animal model, intermediate to rodents and primates in biological complexity, can serve as a bridge between humans and rodents for molecular studies of behavior, thereby leading to the development of potential therapies.  "

"9164617","Germline mutations are the cause of genetic disease, while somatic mutations can lead to cancer. Mutation rates are not uniform across the genome but instead vary by up to 6-fold from one region to another. One of the main factors underlying these regional differences in mutation rates is the time of replication of the underlying DNA. Strikingly, the replication timing program itself varies from one person to another at hundreds of genomic loci (Koren et al., Cell 2014). This project will demonstrate that due to genetic variation in DNA replication timing, every person carries an individual mutational landscape, which is encoded in the genome. We will use innovative experimental and computational methodologies to create a database of DNA replication timing in thousands of people and in three cell types. We will then use this database to identify precise genetic determinants of human DNA replication timing. This, in turn, will link replication timing variation, via shared genetic influences, to other molecular phenotypes such as chromatin structure and gene expression variation, and to human phenotypic variation, including disease susceptibility and cancer risk. Perhaps most excitingly, it will open the way to a new concept in human genetics and in eukaryotic biology in general: that mutation rates at hundreds of genomic regions are genetically encoded and vary in an individual manner. Moreover, linking DNA replication timing to both mutations and gene expression regulation would imply that mutation rates can vary among people in a functionally significant way, altering the risks of genetic diseases and cancer, and changing the evolutionary trajectories of families and populations. The methodologies developed and knowledge obtained through this project will add a new dimension to precision medicine and will transform the field of DNA replication timing, turning it into a mainstream discipline in human molecular, medical, and population genetics."
"9156038","Abstract Ultrafine particles (UFP) are elevated locally near areas of concentrated motor vehicles. Evidence is strong that living near highways or major roadways is associated with increased risk of respiratory, cardiovascular and other adverse health outcomes. In recent work, we have shown associations between chronic exposure to UFP and blood biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Our work has been conducted as community-based participatory research (CBPR) with involvement of community representatives in all aspects of the science. We have published almost 30 papers showing capacity for high productivity. This proposal builds on what we have learned regarding UFP characterization, risk assessment, and exposure mitigation. We propose a youth- engaged (N=45) project that translates our current knowledge base about use of air filtration in building ventilation systems into practice in two of our partner communities. We will use an adaption of the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation (ISF) as a guide and we map each step of the process for translation onto this framework. We start with research on the surprisingly understudied problem of benefits of reducing exposure to traffic pollution. We will conduct exposure experiments with 75 adult participants from our two partner communities. Participants will be exposed to unfiltered and filtered air from a building ventilation system while their blood pressure and heart rate are measured. We will evaluate air quality indoors and outdoors by measuring UFP, black carbon and PM2.5 concentrations. Next, we will translate our research results into practice using Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) and a community-engagement process. The HIAs will assess the potential health benefits of widespread use of improved filtration in building ventilation systems in the communities. The subsequent community engaged process will consist of design charrettes (architectural planning exercises) followed by attempts to influence actual building designs. The charrettes will engage multidisciplinary teams seeking to alter the design of new or retrofitted housing or schools so that they use more protective air filtration. The process of moving our research knowledge into practice will be the subject of social science studies. We will use validated and standard scales as well as qualitative data to assess whether youth participation increases active citizenship and environmental health literacy. There will be a qualitative evaluation of the community processes to learn more about how the relevant science can influence community-level practice. The use of design charrettes in public health research is, to our knowledge, novel. Our proposed research is highly significant and innovative in that millions of Americans live near heavy traffic and little rigorous work has addressed either the health benefits of air filtration or how to influence air handling system design in communities. The combined impact of this work will be improved understanding of how to mitigate the effects of UFP exposure in local communities which could contribute to improving public health."
"9228812","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a complex autoimmune disease that commonly afflicts children. We need to identify the underlying pathogenic cellular pathways in order to develop effective therapies for this disease. Human genetics has potential to provide an unbiased view of the causative disease mechanisms. T1D already has been the subject of intensive genetic investigations, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have uncovered dozens of risk loci. However, mechanistic understanding of these risk loci has been a challenge because the vast majority falls outside of genes, in non-coding regions of the genome. In contrast to protein-coding regions of the genome where we understand the amino acid code, we still do not have a clear framework to understand how non-coding genome variants alter cell function and contribute to disease. To learn how DNA variation throughout the genome affects cellular pathways and contributes to T1D, we now need a deeper understanding of the function of non-coding genome elements in the specific cell types that drive the pathology. We propose an integrated strategy to pinpoint the molecular and cellular effects of T1D risk variants. We will perform a population-based study of how natural genetic variation alters the transcriptional and epigenomic state of human immune cells in vivo. We have unique access to human T subsets sorted directly out of the pancreatic draining lymph nodes of organ donors with and without T1D. We will identify specific gene regulatory circuits in T cells that are disrupted as a result of T1D risk variants at the site of inflammation. These studies will be complemented by rigorous functional testing of candidate causal variants in primary human and mouse cells. We will leverage our recent genome editing advances to alter specific disease- associated genome sequences and directly test effects on gene regulation, cell differentiation and murine models of T1D. We will generate isogenic edited primary human and mouse T cells to validate mechanistic effects of T1D variants. To test the hypothesis that a subset of T1D variants impairs beta cells, we will also edit human ES cells and assess direct effects on in vitro beta cell differentiation and function. Understanding how causal non-coding T1D risk variants disrupt key gene programs in human cells has potential to accelerate development of targeted therapeutic approaches."
"9223456","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alterations in the dichotomy between initiation and resolution of the immune response is a primary contributor to the reduced quality of life reported with aging. As we age, the immune system becomes dysregulated and is characterized by persistent inflammation. Changes in the immune system contribute to the increased susceptibility of the elderly to innumerous diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A crucial aspect of this process is a failure to resolve inflammation, which normally involves the suppression of inflammatory cell influx, effective clearance of apoptotic cells, and promotion of inflammatory cell egress. Working under the hypothesize that the failure to properly resolve inflammatory pathways within the brain significantly contribute to the clinical manifestations of AD, our previous studies demonstrate that chronic inflammation mediated by interleukin-1? receptor 1 (IL-1R1), toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), and tumor necrosis factor-? receptor (TNFR), represents a key mechanism by which ?-amyloid (A?) drives the development of tau pathology and cognitive decline in AD. The potent pro-inflammatory activities of these receptors are counter-regulated by target of Myb1 (Tom1) and its interaction partner toll-interacting protein (Tollip) via endocytosis and lysosomal degradation mechanisms to ensure proper resolution of immune responses. Remarkably, our preliminary data show that levels of Tom1 and Tollip are significantly reduced in human AD brains versus respective aged- matched controls. Further studies using AD model mice, show that reductions in Tom1 and Tollip occur vary early in the disease, prior to tau deposition and cognitive disruption. Therefore, reductions in Tom1 and Tollip may result in excessive expression of inflammatory receptors that in turn lead to exacerbated neuroinflammation, and represent an as yet identified link between A?, tau and cognitive disruption. Here we hypothesize that changes in the resolution of inflammatory receptors are an early A?-triggered event that leads to exacerbated neuroinflammation, which in turn evokes tau pathology, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. To address properly our hypothesis, we will use cutting-edge in vitro and in vivo approaches, such as our novel APPKI-hA?wt that express wild-type human A? under the control of the endogenous mouse APP gene, to establish the connection between A? pathology and changes in Tom1-mediated endocytosis. Lastly, we will investigate the impact of persistent inflammatory receptor activation on tau pathology and cognition by using our innovative wild type human tau model (hTau). This research project will elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms linking A? to Tom1 signaling, tau pathology and cognitive decline in AD. As we gain a better understanding of the age-related changes in the immune system, our overall goal is to craft therapies to proper activate the resolution of inflammation, with the broader purpose of sharply reducing the number of people suffering and dying from AD."
"9172619","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are prevalent in veterans  from the Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) conflicts [1-4], and have been  associated with cognitive dysfunction, which may lead to functional impairment and poor community  reintegration [1, 2, 5]. PTSD can be highly debilitating not only due to emotional dysregulation, but also due to deficits in the cognitive control processes in areas of complex attention, executive functions and learning [5, 6].  Deficits in these cognitive control functions, important for goal-directed behavior have been linked with difficulties in community reintegration, and educational and occupational functioning in individuals suffering from both PTSD and TBI [7-9]. The combined syndrome of PTSD-mTBI is common, complex, debilitating, and requires special consideration beyond each alone. There is a need for empirically based treatment protocols to address the multiple impairments in returning Veterans with co-morbid PTSD and a history of mild TBI.  Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation (GOALS) is a therapist administered cognitive rehabilitation training that targets executive control functions of applied mindfulness-based attention regulation and goal management, and links them to participant-defined real-life goals [11]. In a prior study with individuals with chronic brain injury [11], this training has improved cognitive performance in areas of complex attention / executive function, memory, complex functional task performance, and daily functioning. Furthermore, functional MRI results after training indicated significantly enhanced modulation of neural processing in extrastriate cortex and changes in prefrontal cortex [12]. Preliminary results from an ongoing study with Veterans with a history of chronic TBI also support improvements post GOALS on neuropsychological measures of attention and executive function, performance on complex 'real-life' tasks, and self-report measures of functional performance. Furthermore, participants also showed improvement on the emotional regulation self-report measures. These findings suggest that improving cognitive control (attentional self- regulation in particular) may also improve functioning in other domains, including emotional regulation and functional performance in daily life.  The overall aim of this proposal is to investigate the potential effectiveness of a cognitive training program that targets executive control functions of attentional self-regulation and goal management, Goal-Oriented Attention Self-regulation (GOALS), in Veterans with co-morbid PTSD - mTBI and cognitive difficulties.  In a randomized, controlled intervention study design, 54 OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD,  history of mTBI and residual cognitive difficulties will participate in experimental (GOALS), and/or active  comparison (Brain Health Education - EDU) interventions matched for time and intensity. Participants will be randomized to start with either 5 weeks of GOALS or EDU training. Those who begin with EDU will cross-over to GOALS, while those begin with GOALS will have 5 weeks of self-driven practice only. Both groups will participate in pre and post intervention measurements at baseline, weeks 5 and 10. Long-term follow-up will be at 6 months. Pre- and post-intervention measurements will include performance on untrained: neuro-cognitive tests assessing targeted and non-targeted cognitive domains, complex functional task performance in  low structure 'real-world' setting, and self-report measures of daily functioning and emotional regulation/heath.  When completed, these studies will inform us whether a functional approach, training core attentional self- regulatory control functions, via personally-relevant activities, will be effective in improving functioning for individuals with PTSD and mTBI. The study design will provide a test not only of potential benefits on real life  functioning, but also determine to what extent the benefits are related to actual changes in hypothetically  targeted cognitive and emotional functions."

"9239832","Regular exercise exerts a profound positive impact on health and the quality of aging. Still, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate systemic exercise benefits remains surprisingly incomplete. In particular, details of how work in muscle translates to system-wide maintenance, disease deterrence, and even rejuvenation, are too poorly understood to be harnessed for therapeutic applications. We propose to address this knowledge gap from a new angle that features innovative technology, facile gene manipulation, and integrative in vivo neuronal assays over time. We have developed a C. elegans exercise model that uniquely positions us to address three aims that together will advance understanding of the fundamental biology of exercise benefits outside of the muscle domain, with a focus on neuronal aging. Aim 1 will: a) test C. elegans homologs of genes involved in classical mammalian exercise training pathways for roles in strength adaptation, b) address potential requirements for selected stress/longevity pathway genes in exercise-induced enhancement of muscle strength; c) define animal-wide transcription changes that accompany the trained state. Work will establish a deep mechanistic framework for analysis of exercise benefits and address the degree of conservation of exercise adaptation pathways from nematodes to humans. We will firmly ground a novel genetic model in which whole-animal benefits of exercise can be dissected. In Aims 2 and 3, we shift our emphasis to address impact of exercise on neuronal healthspan. Aim 2 will define the impact of exercise on neuronal healthspan while addressing the overall hypothesis that exercise induces functional, structural, and molecular adaptations in neurons, delaying their age-associated decline. We will conduct a detailed analysis of touch receptor neurons, characterizing how exercise changes neuronal function, morphological restructuring, susceptibility to neurotoxic disease protein toxicity, and mitochondrial status over adult life. We will apply selected assays to evaluate additional neuronal types to document in unprecedented cellular detail how exercise influences in vivo nervous system aging. Aim 3 will exploit unique features of the C. elegans experimental system to dissect the tissue network via which genes needed for exercise adaptation promote muscle and neuronal health benefits. We will: a) address whether selected key genes needed for muscle training act autonomously/nonautonomously to impact neuronal healthspan, and b) test exercise-inducible genes encoding secreted proteins for roles in promoting neuronal adaptations. We will gain initial insights into the tissue-interaction circuits involved in system-wide exercise benefits and we may uncover exercise-induced drivers of neuronal healthspan. Given unequivocal evidence that exercise is the most effective anti-aging, anti-disease, pro-health intervention known in medicine, genetic dissection of exercise's maintenance capacities in native context and over time should yield new insights that guide strategies for improving human health and the quality of aging."
"9251006","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia meeting entitled Neurogenesis during Development and in the Adult Brain, organized by Drs. Alysson R. Muotri, Kinichi Nakashima and Xinyu Zhao. The meeting will be held in Olympic Valley, California from January 8-12, 2017. The complexity of the brain, with thousands of neuronal types, permits the development of sophisticated cognitive and behavioral repertoires. Neurogenesis, the fundamental phenomenon that creates the brain, starts early during development and continues in the adult life, shaping our networks in close association with the environment. This unique meeting will explore neurogenesis from different perspectives, bringing new insights about the fundamental mechanisms that control normal brain development and that contribute to disease situations when this process is altered. This meeting will bring together scientists working on different aspects of neurogenesis to exchange ideas and facilitate novel collaborative projects. The pairing of this meeting with a concurrent meeting on Transcriptional and Epigenetic Control in Stem Cells will further enhance the opportunity for interactions among researchers from different fields pursuing similar questions."
"9161310","Project summary The effective and efficient utilization of the big data accumulated in biomedical sciences, including the genomic, imaging data collected from patients that are often integrated with their electronic health records represents a great opportunity as well as a big challenge for the biomedical data science. Because biomedical data are collected from individual patients, and thus carry identifiable information of the data donors, the projection of their privacy becomes an important concern in large-scale projects including the recently launched Precision Medicine Initiative. In the past few years, significant progresses have been made on cryptographic techniques, including the homomorphic encryption (HME) that enables a direct analysis of encrypted data without decrypting it, and the Secure Multiparty Computing (SMC) that allows two or more organizations to jointly compute a task without exposing to each other?s inputs. Here, based on these techniques, we propose to develop a suite of encryption protocols and open-source software tools that can be used by biomedical researchers in a plug-and-play manner for the statistical analysis of encrypted biomedical data. We note that our methods assume biomedical data will be protected by encryption once they are generated, and the subsequent analysis and sharing will always be performed on the encrypted form, which thus can achieve a high security standard for privacy protection."
"9004831","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advance care planning (ACP), the process by which individuals and their healthcare surrogate can prepare for future treatment decisions, remains underutilized. ACP addresses many of the issues that patients and their caregivers endorse as important in end-of-life care. However, there are many emotional, cognitive, and practical barriers to engaging in ACP. While it has been demonstrated that intervention can increase ACP engagement, this model require a skilled, well-trained moderator meeting with patients and caregivers in lengthy encounters. This type of intensive intervention may be best suited for patients with serious chronic illnesses who are ready to think about their specific disease trajectories and the decisions they are likely to face. The recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences near the End of Life proposes a continuous process of ACP, starting earlier in the lifespan with individuals in good health and an initial focus on identification of a surrogate decision maker and general communication about patients' goals with more in-depth and specific discussions coming later. This proposal describes the evaluation of an intervention to promote initial engagement in ACP. Taking a public health approach to ACP engagement, the intervention is designed to be able to reach a broad cross-section of individuals at modest expense.  The intervention considers ACP to be a health behavior, to which the Trans theoretical Model (TTM) of health behavior change is applicable. The TTM provides a framework for the delivery of tailored intervention materials based on an assessment of an individual's readiness to engage in ACP along with the attitudes and beliefs influencing the desire, motivation, and ability to engage. The PI and her co-investigators have developed a TTM-tailored expert system intervention with stage-targeted brochures and demonstrated the acceptability of these materials to a diverse cohort of older adults. The proposed study represents the logical next steps in this work, by examining the ability of the intervention to reach a wide audience and increase readiness to engage in ACP. The specific aims of the current proposal are:  Primary Aim 1: Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, to examine the effect of an individually TTM-tailored intervention on the proportion of middle-age and older persons who complete ACP, as compared with usual care.  Primary Hypothesis 1: The proportion of older persons completing ACP will be higher among those receiving the intervention compared to persons receiving usual care.  Primary Aim 2: To examine the ability to deliver the intervention to a wide cross-section of individuals.  Primary Hypothesis 2: Among eligible persons, ? 80% will participate in the intervention."
"9343327","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project seeks to develop and obtain regulatory approval for an innovative microtechnology- enhanced surgical device that solves a significant therapeutic bottleneck in the treatment of lens cataract in children and adults. As the leading cause of childhood blindness, lens cataract interferes with the optical performance of the eye and if untreated, can result in lifelong deficits in visual perception or blindness. Cataract surgey in adults, with 3 million plus cases per year, is the most common surgical procedure in the United States that, with the aging demographics, will continue to add to our healthcare burden. The first step in pediatric and adult cataract surgery is technically the most challenging and involves the creation of a hole in the thin lens capsule (capsulotomy) to provide access for the subsequent removal of the diseased lens and if needed, the implantation of an artificial intraocular lens. Due to the unique biomechanical properties of the immature lens capsule, current adult procedures for creating the capsulotomy opening, if applied to infants and young children, only have a 20% chance of success. As a result, pediatric cataract surgeons must make do using devices with tissue chopping functions originally designed for non-cataract surgical uses, resulting in suboptimal capsulotomies. In adults, capsulotomy complications manifest as approximately 24,000 cases of capsule tears each year, which mandate alterations in the surgical plan and produce less than ideal vision correction. Recent studies show that perfectly sized and circular capsulotomies produced by femtosecond lasers potentially lead to better clinical and visual outcomes. However femtolasers are extremely expensive for physicians to acquire and cost individual patients an additional $1,500 out of pocket expense, thus limiting the benefits of this technology to a small fraction of the 3 million cataract surgery patients each year. The overall goal of this project is to provide physicians with a low cost device that automatically delivers dimensionally perfect capsuotomies for all pediatric and adult patients undergoing cataract surgery.  In Phase I & II, we developed an easy to use disposable capsulotomy device that uses a novel microscale tissue cutting technology to provide quick, consistent capsulotomies across a range of surgical skills. The device is based on a microfabricated cutting ring element housed within a collapsible elastomeric housing to produce precise capsulotomies on a millisecond time scale. Our device is inserted through the standard 2.5 mm corneal incision and re-expands to produce a desired capsulotomy 5-6 mm in diameter. Under Phase IIB, we will perform the FDA mandated certifications and testing required for device regulatory approval. In particular, we seek support for transferring the manufacturing of this innovative microtechnology- enhanced capsulotomy device into a FDA certified production environment and the completion of pre-clinical and clinical studies to meet FDA regulatory requirements."
"9152201","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia is defined as cognitive loss severe enough to affect daily living and unlike other leading causes of death, the number of persons afflicted with dementia is increasing. The two most common forms of dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Although they have different etiologies, these two forms of dementia share some similar pathologies such as vasogenic edema and microhemorrhages. These pathologies were also exacerbated when anti- amyloid beta (A?) immunotherapy was used for treatment of AD causing termination of the clinical trials. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteases that can break down the blood brain barrier leading to vasogenic edema and microhemorrhage. The specific goals of this proposal are to determine the contribution of two specific MMPs, MMP2 and MMP9, to the occurrence of vasogenic edema and microhemorrhage, and to evaluate whether the presence of VCID will reduce the efficacy of anti-A? treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide possible targets for adjunct therapies with anti-A? immunotherapy and improve AD clinical trials by screening for VCID co-morbidities.  To achieve these goals, this proposal will utilize in vivo (Aim 1) and in vitro (Aim 2) methods. In Aim 1, the effect of VCID on the efficacy f anti-A? immunotherapy, vasogenic edema, and microhemorrhages will be determined. Transgenic mice with amyloid deposition will be placed on the hyperhomocysteinemia diet to induce VCID and then treated with an anti-A? immunotherapy. When VCID is pre-existing in a model of amyloid deposition, treatment with anti-A? immunotherapy will increase activation of the MMP2 and MMP9 systems, exacerbate microhemorrhages and vasogenic edema, and have reduced efficacy on cognition. Vasogenic edema, microhemorrhages, cognitive changes and MMP2 and MMP9 activity will be determined for Aim 1. Aim 2 will evaluate the role of MMP9 in the degradation of tight junctions in endothelial and astrocyte co-culture. The effect of inhibitio of MMP9 on tight junction degradation will also be assessed. Inflammatory- mediated activation of MMP9 will degrade tight junctions between cerebrovascular endothelial cells leading to vasogenic edema and microhemorrhages and inhibition of MMP9 will reduce tight junction degradation. Tight junction permeability and MMP9 activity will be assessed for Aim 2. Together these aims will offer valuable information on the contribution of MMP2 and MMP9 to vasogenic edema and microhemorrhage occurrence, and the effect VCID has on anti-A? immunotherapy.  These studies will provide training in new techniques. Specifically, the applicant will learn how t execute cell biology based assays such as the sodium fluorescein assay and the isolation of primary astrocytes along with data analysis and interpretation skills. These aims and the training potential provided by them will aid the applicant in achieving their long term career goals."
"9010167","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tear microbicidal activity protects the surface of the eye from environmental pathogens and may regulate levels of commensal bacteria. Human basal and reflex tears are enriched in lacritin. Lacritin is 10-fold less in tears from individuals  suffering from fungal keratitis and selectively downregulated in blepharitis an inflammation of the  eyelid associated with overgrowth of commensal bacteria. A cleavage potentiated C- terminal fragment of lacritin is bactericidal for gram negative and positive bacteria including S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P.aeruginosa and E. coli. Removal of lacritin C-terminal fragments from human tears by repeated passage over anti-lacritin C- (but not N-) terminal antibody columns depleted all antimicrobial activity. One possible implication is that lacritin via C-terminal fragment(s) might be the primary source of antimicrobial activity in tears, and that eyes with insufficient tear lacritin may have significantly increased risk of microbial pathogenicity. Furthe, topical lacritin C-terminal fragment may be therapeutic. The fragment is releasable by a serine protease and is active in buffers as high as 380 mOsm/l. Only 2 - 4 µM fragment is required, in keeping with 18 - 27 µM lacritin in normal basal tears that effectively serves as a lacritin reservoir. Lacritin deletion and synthetic peptide analysis has narrowed the activity to a 15 amino acid region, but with the largest active fragment 54 amino acids long. Although this latent activity promotes bacterial pore formation (but not hemolysis), a second death mechanism is involved. Lacritin bactericidal activity widely compromises bacterial metabolic capacity. It also promotes an accumulation of several amino acids and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate is beneficial to bacterial growth. Thus, disrupts bacterial membranes. It also promotes regulated cell death. Our working hypothesis is that lacritin's latent bactericidal activity may be the main regulator of ocular surface sterility, and that lack of lacritin's C-terminal fragment may be a ris factor for pathogenic infection. Our immediate goal is to explore mechanisms regulating this activity. Our long-term goal is to harness this activity as an ocular therapeutic. Our first aim ass how cleaved C-terminus targets bacteria and their comparative efficacy against a broad spectrum of clinical isolates and in vivo. Our second aim explores the mechanisms of bacterial killing. Our third aim asks how cleavage is regulated."
"9239478","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Providers' improved access to electronic patient information through health information exchange is a national policy priority and a key infrastructure requirement for the US health care system. Thanks to significant public investments, providers have access to different health information exchange approaches to meet their information needs. One approach is referred to as ?pull,? which allows providers to query community-wide, longitudinal patient records. A second approach is ?push,? where key information, such as test results, is automatically delivered to providers. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of either the ?push? and/or ?pull? approach in primary care. Furthermore, which approach to sharing information best fits into primary care is also unknown. Despite the lack of evidence, federal policy encourages the exchange of patient information based on the assumption that the two approaches are equivalent. The objective of this proposal is to address these shortcomings in the evidence-based by clarifying the relationship between ?pull? and ?push? health information exchange usage in primary care settings and by determining the impact of each approach on potentially avoidable and costly health care utilization. Aim 1, Determine whether primary care providers use ?push? and ?pull? as complementary or alternative approaches to health information exchange, leverages a novel dataset of individual provider and staff behavior tracked within an electronic health record system combined with detailed measures of ?push? and ?pull? health information exchange usage. These data furnish a complete, detailed temporal sequence of providers' behavior revealing how each approach to health information exchange is used during a patient visit. Aim 2, Quantify the effect of ?push? and ?pull? health information exchange on potentially avoidable health care utilization, tests the hypothesis that health information exchange usage will be associated with reductions in readmissions and hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. This hypothesis will be tested among patients attributed to a 7-year, retrospective panel of more than 240 ambulatory physicians. The differential timing of implementation will be used to identify the effect of ?push? and/or ?pull? with a regression model that includes physician and year fixed-effects. This approach allows physicians to serve as their own controls eliminating unmeasured time-invariant confounding. This proposed analysis of secondary data is significant because the US has invested billions on interoperable health information technologies, but there is very little evidence of health information exchange's effects on utilization and on how it is used in primary care practice. This proposal is innovative because it will be the first to examine the impact of ?push? and ?pull? health information independently, and jointly, in primary care. This combination goes beyond existing research to accurately reflect current approaches to health information exchange available to physicians and supported by health information technology policy."
"9189639","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropathic pain is a worldwide health problem with limited treatment options due to gaps in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this disorder. Nerve-injury induced neuropathic pain is associated with changes in the expression of channels, proteins, and enzymes within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Kv1.2, one subtype of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) that are responsible for neuronal hyperpolarization, was found to be down-regulated in the injured DRG following nerve- injury. This down-regulation contributes to neuropathic pain genesis, however, the mechanism of how nerve injury causes DRG Kv1.2 channel down-regulation is still incompletely understood. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism of gene transcription regulation that governs gene expression by interfering with interactions of transcription factors with gene promoter. The promoter of the Kv1.2 gene has the binding motif of Oct-1, a transcriptional activator. We recently found that DNMT3a, one of the enzymes that catalyze methylation at CpG islands in genes, was up-regulated in the injured DRG following spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Our preliminary data strongly suggest that DNMT3a is involved in nerve injury-induced DRG Kv1.2 downregulation and contributes to neuropathic pain.  This proposal will determine whether and how nerve injury-induced DRG Kv1.2 down-regulation is triggered by DRG DNMT3a and whether DNMT3a regulates Kv1.2 expression and function, and neuronal excitability in DRG and contributes to neuropathic pain. In Aim 1, we will first examine whether and how DNMT3a contributes to the nerve injury-induced downregulation of Kv1.2 in the injured DRG. We will determine if Kv1.2 reduction is dependent on DNMT3a methylation and decreased Oct 1 binding. In Aim 2, we will observe whether blocking the SNL-induced increase in DRG DNMT3a alters Kv1.2 expression, total Kv current and excitability in DRG neurons and behavioral responses. The proposed studies will provide major conceptual advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanism of neuropathic pain and might open a door for developing new strategies for treating neuropathic pain."
"9148236","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In developed societies, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of legal blindness in people over age 65. Emerging evidence demonstrates an important role for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mitochondrial dysfunction in dry AMD pathobiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by chronic overproduction of superoxide and diminished production of ATP, and it promotes activation of injury response pathways in RPE cells, leading to sub-RPE deposit formation (precursors of lipid-rich drusen) and dysregulation of extracellular matrix turnover, the hallmark features of dry AMD. Thus, mitochondrial-targeting drugs are emerging as an attractive class of potential therapeutics for dry AMD. Technologies to identify the presence of RPE mitochondrial dysfunction in living eyes are limited. Detecting mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo would enable selection of individuals who might benefit from mitochondria-targeting drugs and would accelerate mechanistic studies of mitochondrial dysfunction in dry AMD disease models. The goal of this project is to develop RPE flavoprotein autofluorescence as an imaging biomarker for mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is accompanied by an increased ratio in the oxidized to reduced forms of flavoproteins (especially FAD+), which are important components of the electron transport chain for ATP production. Increase in oxidized flavoprotein produces a characteristic shift in the autofluorescence emission spectra, which is easily measured in isolated cells or tissues. However, detecting this shift noninvasively in tissues of living animals or humans, especially the eye, is much more challenging. It requires both a specialized device to image the RPE and an analytical approach to detect the specific autofluorescence signature attributable to flavoprotein. In this project, we will design and build  prototype multispectral imaging device using a rapidly tunable excitation laser source, an acousto-optical tunable barrier filter, and a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope retinal imager, integrated with analytical software based on synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, to detect and quantify RPE flavoprotein autofluorescence. We will use cell culture and animal model experimental systems to develop and validate this technology, and we will adapt the integrated multispectral imaging device to initiate a pilot clinical study of RPE flavoprotein autofluorescence in human subjects without retinal disease and in subjects with AMD."
"8999526","PROJECT SUMMARY (Developmental Research Program)  The goal of the Developmental Research Program (DRP) of the MD Anderson Cancer Center Prostate  Cancer SPORE is to fund promising studies in translational prostate cancer research. It is directed by Dr.  Timothy C. Thompson and co-directed by Dr. Christopher J. Logothetis. As with our current SPORE, the DRP  in this renewal will emphasize the support of translational research studies that can generate clinically testable  hypotheses to help reduce the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer and/or improve the quality of life of  prostate cancer patients. The Prostate Cancer SPORE Administrative Core has established a broad-based  effort for solicitation of potential DRP projects. Letters of intent of no more than 2 pages for innovative  translational research are invited from MD Anderson and outside institutions and SPORE and non-SPORE  investigators, including participants in the SPORE Career Enhancement Program. These applications will be  screened by the program Director and co-Director (who also serve as the SPORE Principal investigator and  co-Principal Investigator) according to objective criteria. Investigators of selected applications will be asked to  prepare a 5-page proposal modeled after a National Institutes of Health R01. As appropriate, the  Administrative Core Directors and staff will assist investigators submitting proposals formulate translational  specific aims and research plans, as many of these investigators will not have expertise in these areas. The  process constitutes a major educational activity and will further stimulate the development of innovative  translational research concepts. The proposals will be reviewed and prioritized by the Prostate Cancer  SPORE Leaders (Principal Investigators, Project co-Leaders, Program Directors, and Core Directors). The  projects will be funded for 1 year and will be renewable for an additional year on the basis of established  criteria. Developmental Research projects will be evaluated ad hoc and annually by the program Director/co-  Director, SPORE Leaders, Executive Committee, and combined Internal/External Advisory Boards. The DRP  has established a mechanism for termination of projects that do not meet our criteria for continuation;  however, it has not been necessary to utilize this mechanism in the DRP to date.  Nine developmental projects were funded in the current Prostate Cancer SPORE. Investigators receiving DRP  grants wrote 29 publications related to the research supported by their grants during 2009-2014 and were  awarded 19 external peer-reviewed grants. Importantly, 2 DRP awardees are investigators for major projects  in the Prostate Cancer SPORE renewal application: Drs. Sue-Hwa Lin (co-Leader, Project 2) and Padmanee  Sharma (co-Leader, Project 1), highlighting the importance of the DRP in identifying projects and investigators  with potential value for translational research."
"9352929","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developing novel molecular therapies for eye diseases has been identified as a high priority research goal by the National Eye Institute. Infection of the eye and more specifically, the cornea, by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) results in epithelial or stromal keratitis and leads to severe inflammation, pain, corneal cloudiness and, in some cases, blindness. At present, this viral infection of the eye remains incurable and effective vaccines or prophylactic agents against HSV-1 do not exist. Many existing herpetic treatments including acyclovir fail to demonstrate high efficacy in the eye, and are therefore not commonly prescribed for controlling corneal infections. Emergence of drug resistance is also on the rise against acyclovir and similar nucleoside analogs that are currently used to control HSV-1 in general. This proposal will simultaneously test two alternate molecular therapies against HSV-1 using a murine model of corneal infection and examine their synergistic ability to control symptoms and reduce the spread of the virus in the eye and also to the trigeminal ganglion. The first therapy will originate from our hypothesis that high affinity inhibition of the interaction between HSV-1 envelope glycoprotein gD and its cognate receptors on the corneal cell surface can generate strong prophylactic as well as therapeutic effects. To prove our hypothesis we will test an RNA aptamer that binds to gD with nanomolar affinity and blocks the ability of HSV-1 to enter cells and spread from cell-to-cell. The gD/receptor interaction is essential to initiate viral entry and cell-to-cell virus transfer as these steps occr through the cooperative and fusogenic action of HSV-1 glycoproteins gD, gB, gH/gL and host cell receptors. The second molecular therapy will originate from a small molecule, which we have identified as a novel autophagy booster. Since HSV-1 tends to suppress autophagy, the molecules that moderately augment autophagy can show unprecedented promise as highly effective inhibitors against viral infections and their potential use as a topical agent to combat ocular infections can yield a very effective therapy. Our preliminary results show that the candidate molecule, Iazovir, enhances autophagy, which in turn, results in a significant loss of viral infection including an almost complete loss of viral proteins and DNA. Thus, the second goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that an autophagy enhancer will limit virus growth and demonstrate high therapeutic efficacy in the cornea. Ultimately, we will test the exciting possibility that a combination therapy containing the Aptamer and Iazovir will generate strong synergistic effects including higher efficacy and faster recovery time and define a new series of antiviral drugs against HSV-1 infection. To conclude, we propose to test a series of new and promising molecular treatments and define new and more effective ways to prevent and control ocular herpes symptoms and diseases."
"9356601","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Identifying potential targets for interventions to reduce age-related cognitive morbidity in diverse elders is of critical importance to the rapidly expanding aging population in the U.S. Substantial evidence from observational studies suggest that modifiable positive psychosocial factors (i.e., well-being, self-efficacy, social support) are associated with better cognitive functioning among older adults. These effects are independent of negative affect (e.g., depression). However, little attention has been given to subgroups of older adults who are particularly vulnerable to age-related cognitive morbidity: African Americans, Hispanics, and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In addition, it is unclear whether these positive psychosocial factors buffer against the negative cognitive effects of brain pathology, as measured with structural magnetic resonance imaging. This K99/R00 proposal lays the foundation for an independent research career focused on characterizing the mechanisms underlying psychosocial factors that protect against age-related cognitive morbidity among a diverse population. Together, the research and training plans will provide the applicant (1) supplementary training in modeling neuroimaging biomarker data in an aged population, (2) broader experience with psychosocial variables in aging, and (3) a strong foundation in cross-cultural neuropsychology. These experiences will supplement the applicant's strong existing background in geriatric neuropsychology and quantitative methods. The research plan expands an existing community-based longitudinal study of multi-ethnic older adults at Columbia University. This diverse population is followed every 18-24 months with cognitive testing, medical evaluation, health measures, and consensus diagnoses of MCI/dementia. A subset receives structural neuroimaging. This proposal adds well-validated, computer-based measures of psychosocial functioning and cognition from the NIH Toolbox. Cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models (SEM) will test relationships between positive psychosocial factors, cognition, and quantitated measures of hippocampal volume, regional cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity volume, and infarcts. The primary goal is to characterize the role of positive psychosocial factors in late-life cognitive decline and to determine whether they reduce the impact of structural MRI markers of brain pathology on cognitive functioning."
"9144670","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study evaluates a novel application of simulation to transitioning healthcare practices. Process gaps created by systems in flux are identified through immersive multidisciplinary scenarios followed by facilitated debriefing. This premise may be recursively tested where industry trends drive configured change in complex healthcare delivery systems. Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) have shifted towards single family room design, given descriptive reports on benefits for family privacy, patient environment, and staff communication. Hospital staff preparation for the marked culture change is conspicuously scarce in the literature. Prior to opening the nation's largest single family room NICU in 2009, Women & Infants Hospital (WIHRI) developed TESTPILOT: Transportable Enhanced Simulation Technologies for Pre-Implementation Limited Operations Testing. We modeled a functional, immersive, in situ single family room NICU, with the explicit focus of enhancing patient safety at transition. Simulation-based exploration identified 164 latent safety threats (LST) and inefficiencies without exposing a single neonate to risk. Practical changes were made to a) verbal and written communication protocols, b) admissions workflows, c) rapid team responses, d) family centered care e) scripting, f) facilities, g) supplies and equipment, and h) staffing and training issues. Many of these had not been anticipated prior to TESTPILOT, most notably the recursively remodeled systems for routine bedside assistance and emergency codes. A more focused, effective, customized orientation to the new service space was developed for all staff members, regardless of participation in TESTPILOT. In 2012 and 2013, three other institutions replicated TESTPILOT-NICU with our support. They learned simulation, discovered and corrected latent safety threats, and similarly improved systems readiness and staff preparedness. We hypothesize that other transitioning institutions will benefit from TESTPILOT content and methodology. This prospective study will evaluate whether TESTPILOT is generalizable based on a mixed methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative outcomes: Specific Aim 1: Demonstrate that TESTPILOT quantitatively improves systems readiness and staff preparedness across a spectrum of care delivery structures, simulation experience and magnitudes of culture change. LST discovery is accelerated by relevant scenarios, immersive simulations, and constructive debriefings. LSTs in each institution direct process improvement and training to improve patient safety. Staff reactions are conditioned and recalibrated for the new environment. Institutional improvement trajectory is quantified by surveying clinical experts regarding specific processes before and after NICU transition. Specific Aim 2: Assess saturation of latent safety threats over successive TESTPILOT implementations. LSTs identified in previous TESTPILOTs are openly disseminated in a consortium registry. The classification of LSTs evolves with subsequent implementations. Though novel institution-specific LSTs emerge, we posit a finite universe of novel discoveries. The collection of LSTs that saturates discoveries defines a blueprint for similar transitions. Qualitative outcomes will b based on naturalistic observations on the variation of macrosystems testing given a priori institutional phenotypes.  One of the key strengths of TESTPILOT is its ability to uncover safety concerns via human factors using in situ experts. It accomplishes beta testing without live patients. Local experts' systems knowledge is crucial to discovery, more important than previous simulation experience. The local team can readily assimilate the requisite simulation principles: safe environment, in situ, immersive simulation, native roles, progressive simulations, iterative improvement, and prior to move. Unlike previous simulation-based approaches, this study evaluates a process of macrosystems simulation across multiple institutions. To discriminate impact, the qualitative and quantitative measures are NICU-specific. For example, the saturated NICU blueprint would overlap only modestly with an equivalent LST collection for a transitioning Emergency Room. However, the means to optimize LST discovery-the TESTPILOT methodology-is not NICU-specific. We hypothesize the methodology will generalize to other clinical settings and this study will result in a broad blueprint for integrating simulation into oher services in transition."
"9301247","PROJECT ABSTRACT The peripheral and central elements of the respiratory control system are not ?fixed,? but undergo sustained (neuroplastic) circuit reorganization to optimize function. This system can selectively utilize unique afferent modalities and brainstem neural pathways to elicit episodic, coordinated airway protective behaviors (e.g. cough, laryngeal adduction). Neuroplasticity is induced and undermined by inflammation, transient afferent feedback, or CNS injury. As a result, breathing responses and airway protective behaviors are altered in ways that can be adaptive or maladaptive. Existing models of the brainstem network and sensory control system regulating breathing and airway protection do not explain changes in responses caused by neuroplasticity in sensory, central integrating and efferent motor elements of the control system. This knowledge gap concerning peripheral and central circuit-based processes increases the risk of inappropriate depression in breathing or airway protective mechanisms by the neuromodulatory approaches being investigated in the SPARC initiative. In this project, our goal is to understand fundamental principles of modulation and plasticity in afferent pathways, brain networks and efferent systems controlling breathing and airway defense. The proposed research will advance our understanding of circuits underlying respiratory control, laying the foundation for future neuromodulatory strategies to normalize lung function in vulnerable clinical populations. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team to utilize cutting edge genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological and computational modeling approaches to interrogate sensory, central and motor pathways of the respiratory control system. Complementary studies will be performed in human patient populations with various forms of sensory or motor dysfunction, including those with laryngectomy, double lung transplants and unilateral vocal fold paralysis. Through these parallel studies, we will reveal fundamental mechanisms of respiratory neuroplasticity resulting from injury, disease and/or afferent activation. New knowledge from peripheral and central circuits in animal models and humans with pathologies will be used to create an iterative, computational neuromechanical model that incorporates key elements of neuroplasticity. This model will enable predictions as we develop neuromodulatory approaches to inform novel treatments for respiratory dysfunction. The project is separated into four encompassing aims. Aim 1: Identify neuroanatomical and functional plasticity of lung sensory mechanisms that regulate brainstem pathways for airway protective reflexes. Aim 2: Identify short time-scale and sustained, circuit-based plasticity in airway motor, brainstem and spinal respiratory motor pathways induced by sensory feedback (airway and diaphragm) and/or injury/disease. Aim 3: Investigate key features of neuroplasticity in human respiratory behaviors. Aim 4: Develop a neuromechanical computational model of the neural system controlling breathing and airway defense that incorporates plasticity induced by sensory afferent feedback and injury/disease."
"9239084","Abstract Inactivity is a common problem among older kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and is associated with their high incidence of obesity and cardiovascular problems which are the leading cause of death for KTRs. However, the combination of SystemCHANGETM + activity trackers holds promise for increasing activity. The short-term goals of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) are to implement these interventions and obtain preliminary data on older adult KTRs. Sixty KTRs age 65 and older will be recruited from a Mid-South transplant center to determine: (I) if perceptions (usability, sustainability, and acceptability) of activity tracker use differ for older adult KTRs participating in a SystemCHANGETM intervention compared to a control group at 1, 2, 3, 6, & 12 months and (II) the degree to which a SystemCHANGE? + activity tracker intervention improves physical activity (steps per day), functional ability, health outcomes (blood pressure, heart rate, waist circumference, and body mass index) and quality of life for older adult KTRs from baseline to 3, 6, & 12 months compared to a control group using only activity trackers .

"9124811","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and severe type of brain cancer, are hierarchically organized with a small subpopulation of self-renewing highly tumorigenic cells, termed glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), important for tumor initiation, continued growth, and resistance to therapies. GSCs reside in perivascular and hypoxic niches that support their survival and the maintenance of their stem-like state. Like all cancers, GBMs display the Warburg effect, a preferential utilization of aerobic glycolysis for energy supplies. Reliance upon aerobic glycolysis reduces cellular oxygen requirements yet is highly glucose inefficient and requires a steady glucose supply. How GSCs residing in the nutrient-poor hypoxic niche can supply their increased glucose demands amidst local glucose scarcity is poorly known. We have recently shown that GSCs preferentially uptake glucose compared to non-GSCs or normal cells through expression of the specialized, high-affinity glucose transporter isoform, type 3 (GLUT3). GLUT3 is expressed in very few other cell types, including embryonic stem (ES) cells, and non-stem GBM cells cultured in low glucose can de-differentiate, gain stem cell characteristics, and express the ES cell factor NANOG, correlating with survival. The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that ES cell-like epigenetic reprogramming in GSCs allows resistance to extracellular metabolic stress, such as found in the hypoxic niche of tumors, through expression of the glucose transporter GLUT3."

Abstract. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of pain and disability[1-5]. Non-specific low back pain (i.e., without a known cause) is the most pervasive type of back pain [3]. Current therapies [4, 6-12] do not directly address the fact that pain sensation is processed in the brain [4, 6, 7] even though non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) symptomology can correlate with chronic pain induced changes in brain activity and/or structure [13-21]. Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) has been successfully applied for the treatment of chronic pain in some disease states, where treatment induced changes in brain activity revert maladaptive plasticity associated with the perception/sensation of chronic pain [14, 15, 22]. However, the most common NIBS methods, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), have shown limited, if any, efficacy in treating NSCLBP [23-28]. . It has been postulated that limitations in these techniques' focality, penetration, and targeting control limit their therapeutic efficacy [29-33]. Electrosonic Stimulation (ESStim?) is an improved NIBS modality that overcomes the limitations of other technologies by combining independently controlled electromagnetic and ultrasonic fields to focus and boost stimulation currents via tuned electromechanical coupling in neural tissue. This proposal is focused on evaluating whether our noninvasive ESStim system can effectively treat NSCLBP. First in Phase I, to assess the feasibility of the proposed work, we will follow 20 NSCLBP patients after giving a fixed dose of ESStim for 10 days, 20 min/day, over a two-week period (10 SHAM ESStim, 10 ESStim). We will assess a battery of safety, pain, quantitative sensory testing (QST), function, and global psychosocial self-assessments in the patients, evaluated over the treatment period and for at least six weeks following the last treatment session. Next in Phase II, we will follow 40 NSCLBP patients (20 ESStim, 20 SHAM) after giving a fixed dose of stimulation for 10 days, 20 min/day, over a two-week period, followed by three weeks of bi-weekly stimulation, 20 min/day (16 total stimulations). We will evaluate these patients with the same battery of assessments validated in Phase I, and compare the efficacy of the tested interventions for at least eight weeks following the last treatment session. In parallel with the NSCLBP treatments, we will build MRI derived models of the stimulation fields in the heads (electric and acoustic field models) of the NSCLBP patients to calculate the stimulation field characteristics at the brain target sites. Multivariate linear and generalized linear regression models will then be built and evaluated to predict the NSCLBP patient outcomes related to pain, physical function, and psychosocial assessments as a function of baseline disease characteristics and the MRI based dosing models. The computational work will be combined to develop an optimized NSCLBP ESStim dosing model. Overall, we hypothesize that the proposed experiments, computational studies, and technology development will allow us to optimize ESStim for NSCLBP treatment."
"9208079","Abstract This project will improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare for persons with sickle cell disease, an under-served and at risk population by implementing a co-management model of care. Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receive care primarily from specialty physicians and emergency departments (ED), thus resulting in a lack of primary care and a high number of ED visits and hospitalizations. Study team members will disseminate a toolbox of decision support tools, based upon the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) published ?Evidence-Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease: Expert Panel Report, 2014?, to primary care and emergency department providers in North Carolina and portions of South Carolina. The goal is to improve PCP and SCD specialist co-management. We will survey providers about their perception of the awareness, use and acceptability of the tools. We will survey patients about the awareness and acceptability of the co-management model. We will also conduct an exploratory cost analysis. The overall purpose of this demonstration and dissemination project is to evaluate patient and system outcomes associated with the dissemination of a toolbox of decision support tools to PCP?s and ED providers across NC and SC. The specific aims of the project are to: 1. Examine the effects of the decision support tools on study outcomes [ED visits, hospitalization, re-hospitalization within 30 days, PCP and/or SCD specialty visits, co- management, and HU prescription fills] during the 12 months prior to project start and across the 3.5 years of the project in NC and SC.  1.1. Determine which patient (age, gender, rural residence) and practice level (specific CCNC  networks, specific PCP practices) characteristics, and receipt of the dissemination tools)  predict study outcomes.  2. Evaluate individual provider-reported awareness, acceptability, and provider-reported use  of each of the health maintenance tables and algorithms in the toolbox amongst PCPs, SCD  specialists, and ED providers in NC and SC at project start and yearly across the project.  2.1. Explore patient-reported awareness and acceptability of a co-management model of  care in NC and SC. 3. Conduct an exploratory cost analysis of the dissemination and implementation of the SCD co- management model and its effect on healthcare resource utilization."
"9134661","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States. This disease is often detected at late stages after peritoneal metastasis, at which point prognosis is poor. Standard therapy includes combination platinum and taxane chemotherapy following the surgical resection of tumors. Unfortunately, ovarian tumors frequently present with or develop resistance to current chemotherapeutic regimens, and this drug resistance represents a major hurdle in the treatment of disease. The goal of this proposed research is to better understand how to target ovarian cancer and potentially impact clinical outcomes. The role of the Notch signaling pathway in the development of chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer will be explored. Notch signaling is characterized by juxtacrine interactions between Notch receptors and ligands on adjacent cells, and is known to play a role in many aspects of tumorigenesis. The Notch3 receptor is upregulated in ovarian cancer and is correlated with both worse prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. The effect of Notch3 activation in vitro will be assessed with a cytotoxicity assay to determine the dose response to cisplatinum therapy. A mouse model of ovarian cancer will also be used to determine if Notch3 activation in metastatic ovarian cancer will increase platinum resistance. In addition, studies will be performed to determine if the use of a novel Notch3 inhibitor is capable of reducing chemotherapy resistance in a metastatic ovarian cancer model. This will be the first study defining intraperitoneal metastatic ovarian growth with use of combination platinum and Notch inhibitor therapy using non-toxic Notch3-specific inhibition. In addition to its role in endogenous tumor signaling, Notch plays an important role in the establishment of tumor vasculature. Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessel from pre-existing vessels, is important in the development of ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis contributes to tumor cell survival and ascites accumulation. Notch1 signaling is required to produce functional tumor vasculature, and its inhibition is known to disrupt vasculature function. The effect endothelial-specific knock out of Notch1 on tumor vasculature will be assessed in a metastatic mouse model of ovarian cancer. These experiments will elucidate the effect of Notch1 signaling in the vasculature on the growth and development of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the effect of a novel, proprietary Notch1 inhibitor on the development of ovarian cancer and the resultant tumor vasculature will be examined. These studies will generate insights into the utility of Notch inhibition in the treatment for aggressive ovarian cancers."
"9136075","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Reducing the risk of food allergic episodes at retail food establishments. Food allergies are a serious public health concern. It is estimated that each year food allergies are responsible for roughly 30,000 medical emergencies and 150-200 deaths. Research suggests that food allergic episodes are significantly associated with eating at restaurants or other food service establishments. There is no cure for food allergens however, with a basic knowledge of what food allergens are, and how to avoid cross contact during food preparation, food allergic episodes can be prevented. This study will focus on food allergen educational and food preparation interventions that would increase the likelihood of food workers to engage in food allergen avoidance practices and thereby preventing or reducing the risk of food allergic episodes. The goal of this practice research study will be to design and implement evidence based, cost effective training strategy based on food allergy educational and practice needs at retail food establishments. The first objective of this practice research study will be to assess food allergen knowledge and avoidance practices at restaurants to better understand educational and practice needs of food managers, workers, and wait staff, design and implement an effective and practical training intervention, then measure the effectiveness of the training through the improved knowledge and practices at the facilities in food allergen avoidance. The second objective will be to provide a food allergen prevention training strategy to the local food regulatory communities to enhance their food allergen illness awareness and prevention educational efforts during the inspection process or in a classroom setting. To accomplish both of these objectives, CA EHS-Net will:  1. Establish strategic partnerships with food service industry and the regulatory community.  2. Increase awareness of food allergens, its associated risk and avoidance strategies.  3. Develop, design and implement evidence based, cost effective training strategy,  based on food allergy educational and practice needs at retail food establishments. The anticipated outcome of this practice-research intervention study and forthcoming food allergen training strategy, is that it will be used by local food regulatory personnel to enhance food allergen illness awareness and prevention educational efforts during the inspection process or in a classroom setting, and thereby increasing the likelihood of food workers to engage in food allergen avoidance practices. Measurable outcomes of this research practice study will be in alignment with the EHS-Net performance goals to prevent or reduce illness, injury and death related to environmental risk factors. The results of this practice research intervention study may also create a shift in programmatic focus for the food regulatory community, policy changes at local government level, and legislative changes at the state level to promote greater awareness, education and prevention regarding food allergens at retail food establishments."

"9143564","PROJECT SUMMARY  Accurate and efficient assessment of outcomes is central to medical device innovation, evaluation and surveillance. Administrative claims could facilitate prospective device evaluations in older individuals if health outcomes of interest (HOIs) are reliable. Various HOI ascertainment tools, including site-based reporting and patient-reporting are commonly used without rigorous evaluation. Each increases resource utilization vs. claims-based HOI assessment without a clear demonstration of added value, particularly in older cohorts.  Existing predicates using procedure-oriented national registries for evaluation of coronary stents, defibrillators and prosthetic heart valves already demonstrate efficiencies with high impact potential for device innovation over the total product life cycle. Extension of these efforts to long-term outcomes databases such as claims data, if reliable, would integrate these efficiencies for a far broader scope of device applications.  Recently, both the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and the Mini-Sentinel groups have highlighted limitations of existing claims-based HOI ascertainment algorithms. Previous HOI validation efforts for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and bleeding have had limited ability to distinguish between incident and prevalent disease, to establish accuracy estimates within subgroups, or to assess adverse events absent re-hospitalization. In addition, existing claims-based HOI ascertainment algorithms rely solely on diagnostic codes, and the extent to which procedural billing codes would enhance their precision and accuracy is unknown.  Enhanced efficiency cannot serve device evaluation without validated accuracy. This proposal applies a novel linkage of existing in-house clinical and claims data to provide a cost- and time-efficient evaluation of claims-based HOI ascertainment versus 'gold standard' CEC adjudicated outcomes. This study proposal is structured in 3 phases to progressively leverage deliverables through 3 potential years of funding.  In PHASE 1 of this study (year 1), we will refine and validate administrative claims-based HOI coding algorithms using a novel linkage between Medicare claims data and existing clinical trial and registry records. In PHASES 2 and 3 (years 2 and 3, respectively), we will apply these refined mechanisms of HOI ascertainment to the conduct of both 1) the longitudinal surveillance of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) prostheses using available unique device identifiers (UDI), and 2) a pragmatic registry-based clinical trial that builds on the successful piloting of the National Cardiovascular Research Infrastructure (NCRI) by the SAFE-PCI for Women Trial.  This proposal expands and strengthens existing research collaborations and infrastructure for the performance of medical device surveillance and registry-based randomized clinical trials."

"9148230","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that glutathione monoesters (GME) can be used as a first line of defense against ocular toxicity caused by the chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard (SM). This vesicant causes severe ocular injuries, including eyelid burns, pain, prolonged conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, corneal ulceratin and, in severe cases, blindness. Oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and proteolysis are among the known mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of tissue injury induced by SM. It is well established that SM-induced toxicity is associated with depletion of glutathione (GSH) and that supplementation with either GSH or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may prevent and/or protect against SM-induced cellular injury in cell culture experiments. While these findings are encouraging, the approach of using GSH or NAC as a treatment has several drawbacks, including the limited bioavailability of GSH and NAC as well as that the possibility of NAC acting as pro-oxidant. These inherent problems diminish substantially the potential of using either GSH or NAC as therapeutic agents for protection against ocular injury caused by SM. We propose to test the hypothesis that GME protects the eye against damage caused by exposure to SM. Monoesters of GSH, in which the glycine carboxyl group of the GSH tripeptide is esterified, have been shown to be effective GSH delivery agents. They are readily transported into cells and then enzymatically cleaved by intracellular esterases to release GSH. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that GME treatment results in elevations in total cellular GSH levels that exceed those achieved by GSH treatment alone. Hence, GME obviates the cellular uptake challenges associated with using GSH alone as a treatment strategy for chemical warfare agents. The specific goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of GME in treating ocular tissue damage induced by SM. This will involve the use of a novel ex vivo isolated rabbit eye (IRE) model to measure the effect of GME treatment on the depth of injury (DoI) following SM analog exposure. Successful completion of the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide important feasibility data that are anticipated to support the expansion of this project to examining the protective effects of GME against SM in live animals."
"9254114","Abstract Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. However less than 10% of patients are eligible for the current approved interventions of tissue plasminogen activator or thrombectomy. We seek to develop new therapeutics to reduce the extent of damage and functional impairment resulting from ischemic injury to the brain, an area of significant unmet medical need. We have found that interferon regulatory factor (IRF) mediated gene transcription may represent an endogenous mechanism of neuroprotection that is associated with a reduction in ischemic injury. Using both cell and mouse models of stroke we have demonstrated that administration of compounds following the ischemic insult, that are known to induce IRF mediated gene transcription, significantly reduces the extent of damage. These results indicate that activation of IRF transcription factors following stroke may be a viable therapeutic intervention for the treatment of stroke patients. The ultimate goal of this STTR program is to identify compounds that induce IRF transcription in both mouse and human cells but with minimal off-target immune activity. We will identify compounds with acceptable target specification, optimize these compounds through hit to lead protocols and ultimately test for efficacy in a mouse model of cerebral ischemic injury. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Identify lead compounds for therapeutic development of an acute neuroprotectant using an experimentally validated high throughput screening platform. Aim 2: Evaluate and rank lead compounds through hit to lead characterization. Aim 3: Evaluate PK and tolerability of lead compounds and determine efficacy in a mouse model of cerebral ischemic injury."
"9226932","Abstract  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a substantial health care issue affecting both civilian and military populations. Although extremes of head injury are recognizable, mild to moderate TBI (MMTBI) is more difficult to diagnose leading to a need for the identification of circulating biomarkers of brain injury that may facilitate early identification. Using a rat model of TBI we identified a novel marker of neuronal injury, visinin like protein 1 (VILIP-1), that is released into blood rapidly after injury. To facilitate rapid measurement of circulating VILIP-1 we developed a combined lateral flow device (LFD) that provides detection of the biomarker in less than 20 min. Although initial testing in human TBI patients are promising there is a need for further testing in blood samples drawn clinically well characterized TBI patients soon after injury. The aim of the current proposal is to further validate the use of our LFD as a point of care diagnostic for TBI using a combination of archived serum samples from normal control subjects as well as patients with systemic traumatic injuries but no TBI and subjects with mild to moderate TBI and whole blood samples from patients being evaluated in the emergency department of Orlando Regional Medical Center. If successful, the proposed studies will validate the use of our VILIP-1 LFD for rapid in field detection of MMTBI and will provide the preliminary data to support a larger clinical trial of the device that could ultimately benefit both civilian and military populations.  "

"9218097","Project Summary  Adult hippocampal neurogenesis recapitulates the entire process of neurodevelopment in a specialized neurogenic niche within the mature dentate gyrus (DG). The proper maturation and integration of these adult- born neurons are crucial for cognitive functions and mood regulation. Thus, dysregulation of adult-born neurons by developmentally-expressed genes, such as DISC1 (Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1), leads to cognitive and affective behavioral deficits. The DG neurogenic niche consists of multiple cell populations including a diverse group of local interneurons with distinctive electrophysiological, molecular, and innervation properties. However, the specific neural circuits that regulate various developmental processes of the newborn neurons are unknown, yet such knowledge is needed to guide rational therapeutic strategies to treat disorders arising from dysregulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Using optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches, we recently identified two genetically distinct local interneuron inputs onto immature neurons: perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin (PV) and axo-dendritic targeting somatostatin (SOM) expressing interneurons. How distinct local interneurons and their circuitry connections encode and regulate various developmental processes of newborn neurons during adult hippocampal neurogenesis is unknown. We hypothesize that genetically distinct interneuron circuits regulate discrete developmental processes of newborn neurons. Interestingly, we found that newborn neurons with DISC1 deficiency receive aberrant local interneuron inputs from PV and SOM neurons. Furthermore, we found that dendritic and spine development of newborn neurons with DISC1 deficiency were differentially regulated by local PV and SOM interneuron activities. Together, these data suggested that genetic dysregulation of DISC1 may drive aberrant development of newborn neurons in an interneuron circuit-specific fashion. We therefore hypothesize that manipulating activities of distinct local interneurons and their circuitry connections will exacerbate or normalize specific aspects of aberrant development in newborn neurons with DISC1 deficiency. Our results will reveal the role of distinct neural circuits for encoding specific aspects of normal and aberrant neurodevelopment, and guide treatment strategies targeting adult hippocampal neurogenesis."
"9332562","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Stroke, the leading cause of disability, cognitive impairment and death in the US, imposes significant financial and personal burden. The residual effects of stroke affect many aspects of life not addressed by traditional rehabilitation treatments. In particular, persons with mild stroke, typically defined as a stroke with no or sligh motor impairment and a high level of independence in basic activities of daily living, often experience emotional problems, subtle but significant cognitive impairment and decreased participation in productive, social and leisure activity. Despite these problems, persons with mild stroke are typically discharged to home without further referral to health or rehabilitation services other than follow-up with primary care physicians. This is a Fast-Track SBIR application based on the extensive research results from Drs. Baum and Edwards on developing and testing reliable and valid measures of activity participation (Activity Card Sort, o ACS) and cognitive skills supporting performance of simple and complex functional tasks (Functional Behavior Profile, or FBP). These measures have been used to guide treatments to help persons with mild cognitive impairment and their families support functional independence. These measures and the results of other studies will be used to build a dynamic online self-management tool designed to help persons with mild stroke develop individualized strategies that will support optimal recovery. We propose Better Living After Stroke through Technology (BLAST) to help stroke survivors and family members return back to their productive and meaningful lives by proactively 1) helping both the survivor and caregiver set their activity goals using ACS; 2) identifying and addressing the survivors behavioral/functional capabilities using FBP; 3) recognizing and managing stroke symptoms indicative of secondary stroke risks; 4) for both engaging support from online and community resources; and 5) offering tailored self-management recommendations using evidence-based strategies to help them both achieve their activity goals. Stroke survivors and caregivers using our BLAST system are expected to have better survivor self-efficacy and fewer caregiver concerns. In addition, both will have better life satisfaction and increased activity, and the stroke survivor will have better problem solving, task performance and social interaction. Specific Phase I Aims: 1) collect input from stakeholders on system features, perceived usefulness and adoption barriers via focus groups; 2) develop the Web-based mobile-friendly prototype with a user-centric design process; 3) evaluate system usability/usefulness/acceptability. Phase II Aims: 1) enhance and improve the Phase I prototype system; and 2) conduct a randomized controlled trial with 138 dyads of stroke survivors and caregivers to confirm our study hypotheses."
"9255198","Project Abstract The rates of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, unplanned pregnancies, and dating violence among adolescents indicate the need for evidence-based, medically-accurate, comprehensive sexual health education. However, both teachers and parents face challenges in effectively teaching about sexual health and relationships leading to students receiving incomplete or inaccurate information. Young people turn to the media for information about sex, and many media messages about sex are inaccurate and unhealthy. Consumption of unhealthy media messages (e.g., those that normalize or glamorize risky sex) is related to early and risky adolescent sexual behaviors. Media literacy education (MLE), which teaches critical analysis of media messages, has been shown to be an effective intervention for changing risky health behaviors including those related to sexual health. Thus, this Phase I application proposes to develop Media Aware Sexual Health - High School (MASH-HS), an interactive web-based comprehensive sexual health MLE program, designed to develop students? critical thinking skills and promote sexual health. It is hypothesized that this program will enhance adolescents? media literacy skills, sexual health knowledge, cognitions (i.e., attitudes, self-efficacy, and norms), and behaviors regarding healthy sexual decision-making. The program will be based upon the Message Interpretation Processing model, found to be a significant mediator of effective MLE programs in reducing sexual risk behaviors. If effective, this program would be the first comprehensive sexual health, MLE intervention and the first completely web-based program on the OAH list of evidence-based sexual health programs for male and female high school students. The proposed product is highly innovative due to 1) including a broad range of sexual health topics, 2) attention to media influence, a risk factor often ignored in sexual risk prevention programs, and 3) a paradigm shift for school-based sex education away from teacher-led programming towards a self-paced, online format that enhances student learning. Phase I of this project includes two aims. The first aim is to create a prototype of the program based on expert and stakeholder feedback, focus group discussions with target informants (i.e., adolescents), and usability studies. The second aim is to conduct a pretest-posttest feasibility study of MASH-HS in eight 9th and 10th grade classrooms in schools randomly assigned to intervention (i.e., MASH-HS) and control (i.e., typical health education curriculum) (N=136 students) conditions to assess if MASH-HS meets criteria for moving on to Phase II. These methods will provide feedback about the format, goals, and content of the program, and feasibility of the program?s effectiveness for improving adolescent health outcomes. The potential commercial applications include the creation of an engaging, effective comprehensive sexual health program that can be utilized in a wide range of educational settings. One of the added benefits is that while it enhancing sexual health, it will also develop critical thinking skills, highly valued in education settings, which should contribute positively to adoption and scalability."
"9235477","Project Summary Understanding subtypes of gastroparesis and the pathophysiology of symptoms associated with gastroparesis are required before improved treatments can be designed. Our aims are to 1) define major subtypes of gastroparesis using physiological testing for gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA), accommodation, and autonomic nervous system function and 2) explore pathophysiological mechanisms of meal-induced symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and gastroparesis-like syndromes. Variable depletion of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) creates a continuum of dysfunction of electrical and contractile activities of the stomach. Physiological tests to measure gastric emptying, gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA), and gastric accommodation reflect this continuum of ICC depletion from gastric dysrhythmias and normal gastric emptying to delays in gastric emptying. Our recent observations revealed two important subtypes of gastroparesis: 1) obstructive gastroparesis and 2) gastroparesis with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Preliminary studies show positive responses to pyloric therapies and to fludrocortisone and vitamin D in these subtypes, respectively. The important physiological differences in these subgroups of gastroparesis provide the rationale for more precise, individual treatments. Physiological testing during provocative test meals in symptomatic patients with normal gastric emptying (e.g. chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting, dysmotility-like dyspepsia, or postprandial distress syndrome) unmasks subtypes with: 1) gastric dysrhythmias or normal 3 cpm GMA and 2) normal or abnormal gastric accommodation. Our studies will utilize the database of Registry 2 of the Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium which contains extensive physiologic data in patients with idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis and in patients with normal gastric emptying and new data from patients enrolled in the continuation of the Registry. This project will characterize clinically important subgroups of symptomatic patients with or without gastroparesis, increase our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of gastroparesis-associated symptoms, and lead to more rational therapies based on physiological test results."
"9325870","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding mechanisms leading to decrements in lung function, the physiologic hallmark of obstructive lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are necessary to inform interventions to improve lung health. In this application, we propose to examine the role of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, in lung function impairment, respiratory infections and acute exacerbations of COPD as well as evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D levels. Our hypothesis is that reduced cathelicidin levels are associated with accelerated lung function decline though a pathway partially mediated by increased infections and COPD exacerbations. We hypothesize the effect of cathelicidin on lung function is greater in those with vitamin D insufficiency and that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin deficiency. Specifically, through longitudinal investigation nested within an ongoing cohort study of urban, predominantly African-American individuals at high risk for development of OLDs, we will characterize the rate of lung function decline in 380 participants followed with serial spirometry measures for up to six years. Baseline and repeated measures of cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as independent predictors of lung function decline and respiratory infections. Separately, using longitudinal data from 2100 participants enrolled in the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) study with established COPD, baseline measures of blood cathelicidin and vitamin D will be examined as an independent predictor of longitudinal FEV1 decline and COPD exacerbations over three years. In both cohorts, concurrent vitamin D measurements will permit evaluation of antecedent and modifier on the cathelicidin-lung outcomes relationships. Finally, we will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 40 vitamin D insufficient individuals before and after eight weeks of oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels. Completion of these aims will provide a robust determination of the role of cathelicidin in lung function decline and adverse pulmonary outcomes in unique populations of at-risk and diseased individuals. Moreover, the aims of this application directly or indirectly wor towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function."

"9203583","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 5 million people in the U.S. No effective treatments are available to prevent, halt, or reverse the disease. Although aging is the most important nongenetic risk factor for AD, young mice have been used for the vast majority of preclinical studies in AD-related mouse models, mainly for practical and financial reasons. Even at young ages, these models share several pathological features with AD. However, they clearly do not simulate the full complexity of the human condition. We hypothesize that aged mouse models will simulate the human condition to a greater extent than young mouse models and that assessing candidate therapies in aged mouse models will better predict the efficacy of these therapies in later clinical trials. In this UH2/UH3 proposal, we will elucidate the phenotypic impact of natural aging in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice from line J20?one of the most extensively used AD-related mouse models. In addition, we will compare the efficacy of promising candidate therapies in young and old mice from this line. While strategies targeting amyloid-? (A?) have justifiably received considerable attention over the past decade, it is still unclear whether they will turn out to be both efficacious and safe in ongoing clinical trials. We reported in well-cited publications that treatment with the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam and genetic reduction of tau ameliorate synaptic, network and cognitive dysfunction in hAPP-J20 mice, and these findings have been confirmed by other groups in independent mouse models. However, it remains to be determine whether these strategies also have beneficial effects in aging brains that have had longer exposures to pathologically elevated levels of A?. We therefore propose to investigate the efficacy of levetiracetam treatment and genetic reduction of tau in old hAPP-J20 mice."
"9288060","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large-scale protein-protein interaction assays are widely useful in studies of protein interaction networks, drug activity, and protein engineering. The protein-fragment complementation (PCA) assay screens for in vivo protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by converting the strength of an interaction to a relative fitness. For each PPI, protein-fragment-containing haploid yeast pairs are mated and the resulting diploids are tested one-at-a-time. We have developed three technologies that will make PCA more repeatable and higher throughput: 1) a random DNA barcode system that allows us to construct millions of uniquely barcoded yeast strains, 2) a double barcode system that translocates two barcodes on homologous chromosomes to close proximity on the same chromosome, and 3) a pooled fitness assay that allows for accurate measurements of the relative fitness of millions of barcoded genotypes simultaneously via next- generation sequencing. We propose to combine PCA with the above three innovations to generate a massively parallel protein-protein interaction sequencing platform (PPiSeq). Random barcodes are inserted into yeast and are mated to existing PCA strains. Mating of barcoded haploid PCA pools and translocation of barcodes in vivo and en masse yields diploid PCA strains, each with a double barcode representing a specific PPI. Growth of cell pools and sequencing of double barcodes yields an accurate fitness measurement of each double barcode in the pool, which can be translated to an interaction score for each pairwise protein combination. PPiSeq will have have several significant advantages over traditional PCA: it is fast, cheap, highly scalable, and has a low barrier to entry. Notably, PPiSeq throughput scales quadratically with the number of PCA strains, while its costs decline at the rate of next generation sequencing costs. Here, we will construct a large diploid PPiSeq library consisting of ~655,000 unique PPIs and ~6 million double barcodes and use this library to measure the interaction score of each PPI simultaneously via pooled growth (AIM 1). One additional major advantage of PPiSeq over traditional PCA is repeatability across perturbations. That is, once constructed, all pairwise interactions can be re-assayed in new environments easily. Here, we will assay how the yeast protein interactome changes in a heat gradient (AIM 2) and in the presence of three antifungal drugs (AIM 3). This work will provide the first genome-scale view of how the protein interactome changes across perturbations. The constructed PPiSeq library will be provided as a resource to the scientific community for future perturbation studies. Additionally, this work will set the stag for future large-scale PPI screens, such as those involved in drug discovery and protein engineering."
"9144751","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unintentional poisoning is the second leading cause of injury death in the United States. Collaboration between poison control centers (PCCs) and emergency departments (EDs) is dependent upon verbal, telephone communication that can lead to miscommunication, data loss, and error. (3, 4). Recent research has identified numerous vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in the current telephone-based system of collaboration, vulnerabilities that must be addressed in order to ensure patient safety. Health information exchange (HIE), the electronic exchange of patient information, could better support PCC-ED collaboration for poisoned patients during routine operations and in disaster scenarios, when telephone-based communication is fragile. However, we currently lack both process models and informatics tools (standards and software) for PCC-ED health information exchange and this poses a substantial barrier to HIE for U.S. poison control centers operating with limited resources. Moreover, there is no available information on the clinical effects of implementing this type of provider-to-provider health information exchange, including effects on workflow and patient care. The specific aims of this study are as follows: (1) Develop a model process for HIE supported ED- PCC collaboration, (2) Develop and implement informatics tools for HIE supported ED-PCC collaboration, and (3) Evaluate the effects of the model HIE process and informatics tools on workflow, communication, efficiency, and utilization. We will develop a replicable, scalable process for ED-PCC health information exchange and develop informatics tools that enable emergency departments and poison control centers to engage in HIE. We will also evaluate the effect of the prototype information exchange process on workflow and clinical outcomes including emergency department door-to-decision time, time to PCC case closure, and change in the number of telephone calls exchanged between EDs and PCCs. These innovations reflect patient-focused information management and are designed to ensure availability of poisoning-related information to support transitions and collaborations in care. !"
"9353614","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging research focuses the molecular mechanisms of age-related diseases and metabolic deregulation is now appreciated to be associated with and causal in several human diseases of aging. However, the mechanisms of how altered metabolism leads to age-related diseases are not known. Sirtuin regulation of mitochondrial protein modifications controls several aspects of metabolism and is emerging as important regulatory node in aging. The goal of this project is to understand how protein modifications are regulated by the NAD(+)-dependent sirtuin deacylase SIRT4, and how this sirtuin influence the diseases of aging. While all the other sirtuins have a robust enzymatic activity in vitro, SIRT4 so far has remained enigmatic. Recently, we combined phylogenetic, structural, biochemical, and physiological data and identified two novel enzymatic activities of SIRT4. This information provides a deeper understanding of metabolic regulation and the aging process. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the role of SIRT4 in aging; three specific aims will be pursued: 1. Determine the changes in two novel protein acyl modifications, using an innovative quantitative proteomic strategy; 2. Determine the effect of these acyl modifications on protein function by using a combination of cell and murine models, in order to measure the changes in protein activity of specific proteins, as well as the overall function of mitochondria; 3. Determin role of SIRT4 on aging by measuring several physiological parameters of aging using both in vitro cellular assays and in vivo assays in mice, with the overall goal to determine how SIRT4 maintains mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis during aging. This study combines a set of novel protein modifications, a comprehensive experimental design, and an innovative conceptual framework. Furthermore, this study will build a foundation of knowledge to further understand the cellular mechanisms of aging and disease. Importantly, the proposed research is significant to the field of aging because it is expected to advance and expand understanding how metabolic deregulation influences aging, and how this contributes to age-related diseases. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of new therapies against diseases of aging and the aging process itself."
"9154499","Cataracts, or eye lens opacities, form due to congenital abnormalities as well modifications to lens constituents upon aging. Cataracts afflict ~ 85% of the elderly and blind 17,000,000 people. The cyclic process of cell division is required to elaborate the embryonic lens and continues in germinative epithelial lens cells. In contrast, elongating epithelial cells cease division and begin the unidirectional process of differentiation into lens fiber cells. Removal of nuclei from maturing lens fiber cells is crucial for establishing a transparent, functional lens. Failure of denucleation is causally associated with some congenital cataracts, a major genetic cause of blindness. Incomplete cell denucleation is also observed in many animal models that are used to elucidate mechanisms of senile cataractogenesis. The molecular mechanisms that govern lens cell denucleation have remained an enigma for over a century. Elucidation of these mechanisms is critical for development of strategies and new drug targets for prevention of cataracts. The proposed research will break new conceptual ground by demonstrating how processes that are used to regulate the cyclic process of cell proliferation have been appropriated for removing nuclei in lens fiber cells. We will also add to fundamental understanding about ubiquitin, Cdk and p27 biologies as well as bring new technologies to eye research.  We will first corroborate our preliminary data indicating that the lens contains and appropriates the molecular machinery for denucleation from usual cell division or mitosis. Specifically, we hypothesize that cyclin dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1) that usually controls mitotic entry, also controls denucleation (Aim 1), and that Cdk1 is itself regulated by a recently discovered autoregulatory loop. We will both characterize the components of the Cdk1 autoregulatory loop that function in fiber cell denucleation, and utilize genetic and pharmacological approaches to inactivate and unambiguously identify the relevant Cdk1 regulators that initiate the denucleation process. Our published work suggests that Cdk1 activity in the lens is inhibited by the cell cycle inhibitor, p27Kip1 , in a location dependent manner. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that accumulation of p27Kip1 is a common governor of Cdk1 activity in mechanistically diverse models of cataract that involve failed lens fiber cell denucleation. In Aim 3, we will utilize novel 3D imaging capacities to learn how Cdk1 functions at the nucleus to allow entry of the degradative machinery that executes the final steps of lens denucleation.  None of these concepts or technologies have been previously studied or exploited within a lens context. To do this work we are also creating new animals that will be of great interest to cancer biologists and the drug developers charged with improving cataract surgery outcomes or delaying cataract. The information will also reveal new ways to control ?secondary? cataracts and cell proliferation, the latter also being of keen interest to cancer researchers. Additionally, our novel integration of pathways of control of cellular protein quality, cell replication and development/aging, will also find use in the neurodegeneration field."
"9136650","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare epilepsies are a devastating group of diseases that begin in childhood, and often cause profound neurologic, medical, and psychiatric disabilities. There are reliable epidemiologic estimates for only a few of these diseases. Tuberous sclerosis (TS), for example, affects 1 neonate per 5700 live births. However, for some diseases like Aicardi syndrome, estimates are limited to counts of known cases (900 in the US). And for others, such as MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers), there are no estimates at all.  Several obstacles have impeded surveillance and epidemiology of this vulnerable and medically complex population. First, identifying individuals in large datasets is difficult. Although some diseases have specific billing codes (i.e. ICD-9 759.5 TS + 345.x epilepsy = TS with epilepsy), most are coded with nonspecific diagnoses like 345.9 (epilepsy unspecified) or 780.39 (other convulsions). Second, although caregivers have formed advocacy groups for individual rare epilepsies, these groups only recently united to support research. Third, many individuals seek care at multiple centers, preventing a full assessment of their history from clinical data at a single center.  There are new opportunities to study these diseases. First, broad use of electronic health records (EHRs) now allows researchers to analyze large volumes of clinical notes with text processing tools. A regular expression, for example, is a robust, easy-to-share technique to specify a text search. Second, the Rare Epilepsy Network (REN) has unified advocacy groups for rare epilepsies into a federally funded research consortium. Third, multi-institutional clinical data research networks such as the New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN) are gathering medical records from multiple institutions.  The central idea of our proposal is that text processing of clinical notes ill improve surveillance and epidemiology of the rare epilepsies. We will use the NYC-CDRN to identify affected individuals using EHRs from multiple academic medical centers. We will describe the incidence, prevalence, comorbidities, mortality, and quality of ambulatory care for these individuals. Finally, we will develop, characterize, and disseminate specifications for searching text (a set of regular expressions) to find affected individuals in clinical notes.  Improved epidemiological estimates will guide clinical care, prioritize research initiatives, spur development of therapies by industry, and help caregivers understand these devastating diseases. The text searching specifications (regular expressions) will help centers identify rare  epilepsies to support surveillance, research, quality improvement, care management, and referral to advocacy organizations. This work aligns with recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations (1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13) and with the 2014 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Epilepsy Benchmarks (IC, IIC, IIF, and IVD)."
"9346152","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Human Genome Project and follow-on projects such as the International HapMap, 1000 Genomes, and ENCODE Projects are providing powerful resources for the identification of genes that predispose to human diseases. Along with these resources have come increasingly efficient technologies for genotyping and DNA sequencing. These resources and technologies will be critical as we continue to seek to unravel the complex etiologic basis of common human diseases.  In this proposal, I address a set of statistical problems that arise in human disease gene mapping. I describe how my colleagues and I will address these problems through analytic methods, computer simulation, and application to interesting complex disease genetics data, and how we will generalize these solutions through the production, distribution, and support of efficient computer software. Specifically, we will:  1. identify the range of genetic models consistent with available linkage and association information to aid in the efficient design of large-scale resequencing studies;  2. develop efficient multi-stage designs for large resequencing and follow-up association studies with a particular focus on the optimal combination of sequencing, genotyping, and genotype imputation;  3. identify the most probable set of causal variants among those tested in GWAS or resequencing studies;  4. develop methods for efficient association fine mapping of known causal loci and detection of additional causal loci given GWA and/or resequencing data on multiple ancestry groups; and  5. continue to develop, test, distribute, and support computer software based on the methods that arise from the other aims of this project, and update, distribute, and support our current software, including SIMLINK, RHMAP, RELPAIR, SIBMED, LocusZoom, Snipper, and Spotter.  In addition, we will continue to be opportunistic in identifying and addressing important statistical problems that are related to the goals of this project. Under separate funding, we will apply the resulting methods to the analysis of data from genetic studies of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative traits."

Outcomes of focus remain incident chronic disease and its progression, disability, retirement decisions, health in retirement, and mortality. Our unique data set has been augmented to include early life social context via Census data; personal and family work experience and income across the life span via IRS and SSA; post-Alcoa health and mortality via Medicare and the National Death Index (NDI) and contextual social environment from lifetime residential geocoding. Consequently, we propose in the next cycle to embrace a life course approach to study the social, environmental and behavioral determinants of the outcomes listed above The specific aims of this grant are: Aim 1: Link Alcoa workers to individual census records to examine how early life environment influences later life health outcomes. Aim 2: Assess the impact on health and function of adverse working environment as it accrues during work-life, with an emphasis on ubiquitous physical hazards. Aim 3: Identify antecedents of short-term and long-term disability across working life as candidates for subsequent hypothesis testing. Aim 4: Assess the impact disability benefits have on employee work function and health. Aim 5: Examine how injuries and health shocks affect retirement savings and subsequent health trajectories. Viewed altogether, continuation of the Alcoa study with the assembled team of investigators provides an unparalleled opportunity to address a host of critical empiric and methodologic issues previously unapproachable. In addition to understanding better which occupational exposures contribute to chronic disease and disability, these data will allow us to control for economic and other contextual factors to an extraordinary degree."

"9050034","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long-term monocular deprivation (MD) initiated before any visual experience leads to permanent loss of vision through the occluded eye, and is much more resistant to recovery later in life compared to MD initiated after a period of normal vision. At a functional and anatomical level, it is known that long-term MD leads to a shift in ocular dominance (OD) in the primary visual cortex (V1). In particular, V1 neurons lose responses from the deprived eye, which are thought to result from mechanisms resembling long-term depression (LTD). While recent studies have reported recovery from long-term MD using either genetic manipulations or invasive pharmacological interventions, these cases have been limited to long-term MD after about a week of normal vision during early development. Studies have shown that MD initiated before eye opening in diverse animal models is much more resilient to recovery, and is thought to involve changes in thalamocortical (TC) inputs to V1. Hence methods to recover plasticity at TC synapses would benefit recovery from chronic long-term MD without initial vision. We recently found that deafening adult mice for a brief duration leads to potentiation of TC synapses in layer 4 (L4) of V1. Here we propose to examine whether deafening adult ferrets for a brief duration would allow cross-modal potentiation of TC synapses in V1 to promote recovery from chronic long-term MD initiated before eye opening. Ferret V1 is organized similar to humans with OD columns and orientation pinwheels, which overcomes the limits of mouse V1 lacking such modular organization. To test our hypothesis that deafening promotes TC plasticity in adult ferret V1, we will utilize channelrhodopsin based optogenetic tools to quantitatively measure the strength of TC synapses in L4 of V1 with or without deafening (Aim 1). In addition, intracortical synaptic strength in L4 will be quantified. T investigate whether cross-modal potentiation of TC synapses promotes recovery from chronic long-term MD, we will compare V1 neuronal functions, including OD and visual acuity, using multi-site laminar recording probes (Aim 2). The results from our study will determine whether cross-modal sensory deprivation in adults would promote recovery from chronic long-term MD by restoring TC plasticity. Our results could be generalized to promote recovery from sensory loss in other modalities, and pave a way to develop non-invasive means to recover from deprivation amblyopia in adults."
"9337940","During pregnancy, dramatic growth of fetal and placental vasculatures is required for remarkable increases in fetal and placental blood flows to supporting the developing fetus. During these processes, vascular endothelial cells reside under physiological chronic hypoxia (pCH), which is critical for cell homeostasis as more severe hypoxia is known to be associated with many endothelial dysfunction related diseases such hypertension and preeclampsia. VEGF and FGF2, two potent growth factors actively regulate many endothelial functions via protein kinases and also via G proteins including GNA11 and GNA14. Specifically, GNA11 has been shown to be required for VEGF-simulated growth of new blood vessels. GNA14 has also  been implicated in human hypertension and preeclampsia. However, nothing is known regarding the actions of GNA14 in endothelial cells. To study the roles and underlying signaling mechanisms of GNA14 and GNA11 in mediating fetal endothelial functions, we propose to examine the roles of GNA14 and GNA11 in modulating pCH-enhanced vascular growth and vasodilatory actions in response to VEGF and FGF2 using primary HUVE and HUAE cell lines established under pCH (-20-25 days; 37 C, 5% C02, 3% 02) and standard cell culture normoxia (-20-25 days; 37 C, 5% C02, 95% air, SCCN). These studies are the first to systemically explore the role of GNA14 in mediating endothelial functions, and the role of GNA11 in mediating eNOS expression and activation. The findings of these studies will greatly advance our understanding of actions of GNA14 and GNA11 in human fetal angiogenic and endothelial vasodilatory  functions, particularity under pCH, which will provide clues about novel targets for therapeutic intervention in these hypertension-related diseases."

While antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy can virtually eliminate mother-to-child transmission, it increases the risk of PTB beyond the excess risk attributable to HIV itself. This has led us to the untenable place where, in too many instances, the price of stopping perinatal HIV is prematurity-related neonatal death. Prenatal progesterone reduces the risk of PTB among women diagnosed with shortening of the uterine cervix and among women who have experienced a prior spontaneous PTB. It is standard of care for these indications in the United States. This application has two specific aims. In Aim 1, we propose a placebo-controlled, double-masked randomized clinical trial of the drug 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17P) to prevent PTB among HIV-infected pregnant women initiating or continuing antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) in Malawi and Zambia. Because stillbirth and preterm birth are competing risks, the trial's primary outcome will be a composite of live birth prior to 37 weeks gestation or stillbirth at any gestational age. The trial is powered to assess whether 17P has the same prophylactic efficacy among HIV-infected women as it does among women with a prior PTB (an indication for which it is FDA approved). Our specific hypothesis is that 17P will reduce the primary outcome by 38% (i.e., from 24% to 15%). The trial will randomly allocate 800 consenting women in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly intramuscular injections of either active drug or matched placebo. We will follow women through pregnancy and mother-infant pairs to 42 days postpartum. In Aim 2 of this application, we will study the relationship between timing of ART initiation and the risk of PTB. Our hypothesis is that HIV-infected women who start ART during pregnancy will have higher rates of PTB compared to women who enter antenatal care on ART started prior to conception. This trial will take advantage of longstanding partnerships and robust research infrastructure in Malawi and Zambia. If our primary hypothesis is confirmed ? that 17P works as well among HIV infected women as it does among those with a prior preterm birth ? we will have identified an intervention that could prevent as many as 70,000 preterm births per year worldwide."
"8999051","Project Summary/Abstract  The Tumor Microenvironment Program at USC Norris was created in 2003. The concept behind this Program  is that the fundamental investigation of the mechanisms that control the interaction between malignant cells  and their nontransformed microenvironment should lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic  intervention and better prognosticators. The overarching goal is to make innovative basic discoveries on the  role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and by interacting with other Programs of USC Norris, develop  these discoveries into investigator-driven clinical trials. The Program has three scientific objectives: 1) to  investigate the fundamental mechanisms of communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment;  2) to understand the contribution of viral-induced lymphangiogenesis/angiogenesis to Kaposi sarcoma; and 3)  to understand the mechanisms of immune escape and develop new approaches to cancer immunotherapy.  The Program Co-Leaders Yves DeClerck and Martin Kast have complementary recognized expertise in the  tumor microenvironment and in immunotherapy, respectively. The Program brings together 28 members from  16 departments in four schools at USC with expertise and research interests in inflammation, tumor-stroma  interaction, metastasis, angiogenesis, Kaposi sarcoma-associated Herpes Virus (KSHV), human papilloma  virus (HPV)-mediated oncogenesis, and immunotherapy. The Program has obtained new funding in the tumor  microenvironment (one U54, three R01s, one DoD) and in viral-mediated angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis  (one P01 and one R21). A unique aspect of this basic science program has been its commitment to translation.  Over the last five years, the Program has been the hub where fundamental observations made by its members  have led to nine clinical studies/trials. Research conducted by members of the Program has a unique impact  on specific populations of the LA County catchment area, particularly children (neuroblastoma and childhood  ALL), women of low economic status (HPV-induced cervical cancer), and HIV-infected patients (Kaposi  sarcoma). During the current project period, Program members have published 319 papers, of which 40% are  inter-programmatic, 17% are intra-programmatic, and 28% inter-institutional. Program members have $11M  (direct costs) in peer-review funding, with 40% from NCI and 27% from other NIH sources, and 5% from other  peer-reviewed sources."
"9253129","Establishing the functional viability and dose-response of Duck, Duck Punch: A Stroke Rehabilitation Computer Game ABSTRACT Only 15% of stroke survivors experience full recovery of arm/hand movement. Long-term arm movement impairment restricts independence with self-care and vocational activities, increases caregiver burden and reduces quality of life. Strong evidence is emerging that traditional therapy programs do not provide adequate amounts of movement practice needed for motor recovery yet, current financial pressures increasingly limit stroke rehabilitation programs. Thus, there is a need for innovative technology to augment traditional programs to provide the necessary movement practice within the constraints of the current rehabilitation landscape. To meet this need, we developed a prototype Kinect-based post-stroke rehabilitation game called Duck Duck Punch (DDP). While maintaining the appeal of a game, DDP has a therapeutic focus because its unique design elicits an arm motor recovery process consistent with evidence-based stroke rehabilitation principles. The player moves his/her physical arm to control an avatar arm to reach and ?punch? virtual ducks. Custom features allow tailoring of the game so that patients' success requires ?therapist approved? healthy arm movements. Therapists can integrate DDP into in-clinic or in-home programs for additional quasi-supervised movement practice because a performance report quantifies and monitors progress toward motor recovery goals. We licensed DDP and formed a company, Recovr, which has received investment funding for initial start-up and market research. In a funded NIH/NIGMS CTR pilot project, we established the technical merit and feasibility of DDP as a tool to augment inpatient, outpatient and home-based stroke rehabilitation. Very promising results motivated the current project that seeks to test the functional viability of DDP and determine its commercial potential. In this project we propose to (1) evaluate whether home use of DDP for 6 weeks improves post-stroke arm motor ability; (2) examine the dose-response relationship by relating movement repetitions to arm motor skills; and (3) determine the treatment validity of the DDP report as a measure of impairment and response. We will enroll n=60 subjects with stroke to participate in a single blinded, parallel- arm study with blocked randomization according to arm impairment level to test the hypothesis that playing DDP facilitates improves arm motor skills more than playing a commercially available game. In addition stroke survivors (n=16), caregivers of stroke survivors (n=16) and stroke rehabilitation therapists (n=32) will participate in focus groups to guide further development of the DDP summary performance report in order to improve its validity for informing future treatment decisions. This project is important because there is a need to develop and market new options to extend post-stroke arm motor rehabilitation programs. This project will yield data regarding DDP's effect on recovery, dosing, and the translatability of its performance report. Thus, this Direct-to-Phase-II SBIR will set the stage for a future definitive study to enable clear decisions regarding the clinical utility and commercialization of DDP to therapists and stroke survivors."
"9263500","Project Summary The intestinal microbiota is extremely important to human health and development. Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous surge in the number of studies analyzing the gut microbiota; however, there are still relatively few mechanistic studies aimed at understanding basic biological properties of this ecosystem and its members. In recent years, our lab has been studying how predominant gut Bacteroidales members interact with each other in both beneficial and competitive/antagonistic relationships. These studies are essential to understanding how these bacteria become established in the mammalian intestine to form stable health- promoting communities. This proposal is a continuation of our studies of antagonism among these bacteria, specifically studying secreted antimicrobial molecules produced by the gut Bacteroidales. Under the initial project, we made unexpected findings regarding the types of secreted antimicrobial molecules produced, the range of Bacteroidales species that secrete antimicrobial molecules, and the mechanisms of resistance in producing strains. The goal of this renewal project is to understand the breadth of secreted antimicrobial molecules produced by the gut Bacteroidales, their targets and mechanisms of action in sensitive cells, and their importance in mediating competition, invasion and defense in the mammalian gut microbiota. In Aim 1, we will study a large class of proteins with membrane attack/perforin domains produced by diverse gut Bacteroidales using predictive data to determine which of these molecules have antimicrobial activity and how they target sensitive cells. In Aim 2, we will study a eukaryotic-like ubiquitin molecule with antimicrobial activity, likely acquired by B. fragilis by inter-kingdom transfer, and determine its target and mechanism of action. Aim 3 is designed to analyze the breadth of antimicrobial molecules produced by the gut Bacteroidales by studying diverse Bacteroidales species that produce potent secreted antimicrobial molecules of different classes. In Aim 4, we will use a combination of analyses, including computational modeling, experimental analyses in gnotobiotic mice, and analyses of human metagenomic datasets to understand the ecological relevance of secreted antimicrobial molecules of the gut Bacteroidales and how they contribute to ecosystem invasion, defense, and stability. Currently, we are the only group studying secreted antimicrobial proteins of the gut Bacteroidales and their ecological implications. The comprehensive analyses that will be performed in this proposal are unprecedented in the field and the ecological properties that we uncover will serve as guiding principles that can be applied to numerous human health applications such as restoring a healthy microbiota to dysbiotic patients, and the creation of improved probiotics."
"9167960","Vasculogenesis in Thyroid Eye Disease PROJECT SUMMARY In Graves disease, the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing abnormal levels of thyroid hormone production. For reasons that are unknown, one of the primary sites of the pathology that occurs in Graves disease is the orbit, including the muscles that move the eyes and the orbital fat. Additionally, the inflammation associated with this condition leads to extraocular muscle enlargement and adipogenesis, which results in proptosis and eyelid edema. Graves eye disease, also called thyroid eye disease (TED), is a potentially sight-threatening condition in which approximately 10-20 percent of patients with this systemic autoimmune disorder will develop severe inflammation in the eye sockets that can lead to disabling double vision or irreversible vision loss. Currently, there are no specific treatments for TED beyond steroids and/or surgical decompression of the orbits, which involves breaking of the bones surrounding the orbit. To date, research has centered on identifying what makes the orbit a unique, vulnerable environment for this systemic condition, as other areas in the body with fat deposits fail to exhibit similar inflammatory changes. Previous studies suggest that under normal conditions, orbital tissues have blood vessels, but there is an absence of lymphatic vessels within the orbital fat surrounding the eye. In contrast, other fat deposits within the body contain both blood and lymphatic vessels. Based on this, we hypothesize that the orbital inflammation and edema that occurs in TED may be caused by the inability to drain fluid from the interstitial space, as there are no lymphatic vessels within the orbital tissue. While TED is most often characterized by chronic inflammation, episodes of acute inflammation that may be vision threatening can occur. Preliminary data from our laboratory demonstrates that blood vessel proliferation and new lymphatic channel formation occurs within the orbit during the acute inflammatory episodes in TED. Thus, we believe that regulation of blood and lymphatic vessel formation within the orbit could ameliorate the effects of acute orbital inflammation. To test this, we propose to determine the novel molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of blood and lymphatic vessels within the human orbit (Aim 1) and to investigate whether the regulation of new blood vessel formation and/or promotion of lymphangiogensis can reduce the orbital edema phenotype observed in an oxazolone mouse model of acute orbital inflammation developed in our laboratory (Aim 2). At the conclusion of these studies, we will have expanded our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying vasculogenesis within the orbit by identifying potential targets responsible for the regulation of orbital vasculogenesis. It is hoped that the identification of these novel targets could lead to alternative therapies for the treatment of the acute inflammation that occurs in TED."

"9071070","Project Summary  Renal cell carcinoma of clear cell type (ccRCC), the most common type, is characterized by inactivation of  the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which is observed in >85% of tumors. Because no other  gene is mutated at a similar frequency, and VHL mutations are a known initiating event, VHL loss is regarded  as the governing event in ccRCC development. Loss of VHL activates HIF-2, which is sufficient to reconstitute  tumor development in ccRCC cell lines restored with VHL. Arguably, HIF-2 is the most attractive target for  drug development in ccRCC. HIF-2 is implicated in cell survival, proliferation, pluripotency and angiogenesis.  Among these pathways, only angiogenesis is targeted clinically, today. Targeting HIF-2 would disrupt multiple  pro-oncogenic pathways simultaneously, but as a transcription factor, HIF-2 is considered undruggable. HIF-  2 is an obligatory heterodimer of a constitutive HIF-1? subunit?and a regulated HIF-2? subunit, which was  discovered at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). Detailed structural studies of HIF-2??at UTSW  identified a 280Å3 cavity within the PAS-B domain, a domain implicated in heterodimerization. Despite the  fact that this cavity is buried, UTSW investigators determined that it was accessible and hypothesized that it  may provide a foothold for a small molecule. Such a molecule may induce conformational changes  transmitted to the surface of the domain disrupting the interaction with HI F-1? and antagonizing HIF-2  function. Proof-of-principle experiments confirmed this idea and an ingenious high-throughput screen  involving 200,000 compounds led to the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of HIF-2  heterodimerization. The lead compound was optimized through medicinal chemistry efforts at UTSW and was  subsequently licensed to Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., a company founded by UTSW investigators and located  in the UTSW BioCenter. Peloton has developed this compound into a highly-potent and selective inhibitor of  HIF-2 (HIF2-I) with appropriate pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability. This drug induces  regression of established ccRCC cell line xenografts, and preliminary experiments show remarkable activity  in some patient-derived xenografts (PDX)/tumorgraft models. However, not every ccRCC tumorgraft  responds. The aims of this project are: (i) to identify a biomarker of HIF-2 dependency in ccRCC, (ii) to  anticipate mechanisms of acquired resistance to HIF2-I, and (iii) to evaluate multiparametric MR imaging as  a pharmacodynamic biomarker in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of this first-in-class HIF2-I in metastatic  ccRCC patients. The successful development of an inhibitor against HIF-2 serves as a paradigm for  innovation. To our knowledge, this is the first isoform-specific inhibitor of a transcription factor of the non-  nuclear hormone receptor family. This illustrates how ground-breaking basic science discoveries can be  translated into innovative drugs through successful academic-industry partnerships."
"9357856","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a progressive and tiered training program that will develop researchers and research teams able to carry out the research agenda in the linked UO1 application (1/2 - GEOHealth Hub for Research and Training in eastern Africa - Ethiopia) and to facilitate the translation of the evidence into impactful actions. The training program will be implemented in collaboration with Addis Ababa University (AAU) in Ethiopia, the Hub institution for the linked application; the Spoke institutions are in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The training program will build the competencies needed to address the research themes identified as most critical in the Situational Analysis and Needs Assessments (SANA) carried out during the planning phase: indoor and outdoor air pollution as the leading theme; occupational health, particularly in regard to temperature and air pollution, and climate change and health as secondary themes. The team assembled for the U2R application includes experienced researchers and educators from the University of Southern California and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M), both groups having collaborated with AAU previously. The SANAs document a shared need across the Hub and Spokes for enhanced research capacity, along with skills in policy translation in the domestic and regional context. Our approach responds to these broad needs and involves a tiered training program that will create scientific leaders (Lead Scientists) at the national level who can function as principal investigators for research that provides evidence relevant to national and regional issues. They will also be expected to take leadership for locally developed training and to help to assure sustainability. Three cohorts of four will be identified and trained. Beyond these national leads, we anticipate a broad array of shorter-term training opportunities that will prepar the research teams to address the thematic areas of the Hub's research program. The national lead investigators will play a collaborative and progressive role in the design and implementation of the national and regional training initiatives. Given the feasibility restraints posed by financial resources, distance, and the need to integrate training into the ongoing responsibilities of trainees, we plan to use a flexible array of educational modalities that will include stays of limited length at USC and the UW-M; in-country workshops and short courses; distance-based approaches that are both asynchronous and synchronous; and use of selected local courses, e.g., in epidemiology or biostatistics. We will also use innovative approaches to facilitate translation that involve education and engagement of stakeholders. Evaluation will track the success of the participants in meeting their development goals on the short-term and, for the longer-term, successful completion of the proposed research, scientific presentations and papers, and successful funding applications. Through careful case-studies, we will examine the impact of the trainees on policy indicators, such as new air quality standards and guidelines, regulations, and changes in practices."
"9239865","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a competing renewal application of R01 AI51622 entitled ?Chemical Mycobacteriology?. The broad objectives of this project are (1) to study the effects of tuberculosis drugs on mycobacterial cell wall dynamics by in vivo imaging in the Mycobacterium marinum/zebrafish infection model; and (2) to develop a new point-of- care method for clinical detection of live Mtb in patient sputum samples.  Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic pulmonary disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). A variety of drugs have been identified that rapidly kill Mtb and its relatives in vitro, yet clinical treatment requires at least 6 months of combination therapy and resistance is rampant. The reasons that antibiotics are less effective in vivo remain unclear, and this knowledge gap is exacerbated by our inability to directly study the molecular effects of TB drugs on bacteria during infection. To do so would require an infection model amenable to noninvasive monitoring, and probes that report on bacterial systems affected by drug action.  In the previous granting period, we developed chemical methods for imaging components of the mycobacterial cell wall, a target of several frontline TB drugs. We used metabolic and bioorthogonal labeling methods to image trehalose glycolipids of the mycomembrane, an essential cell wall layer disrupted by the TB drugs isoniazid and ethambutol. In parallel, we developed reagents for imaging newly synthesized peptidoglycan (PG) in bacteria residing within human host cells. These methods offer a newfound capability of monitoring how the cell wall responds to drug treatment during the course of infection.  Our proposal for the next granting period comprises three specific aims. Aim 1: We will investigate the effects of TB drugs on cell wall dynamics in vitro and in vivo, with an eye for identifying stages of infection that perturb drug responses. We will image changes in trehalose mycolate production, subcellular localization and mobility as a function of infection stage and drug treatment using the M. marinum/zebrafish infection model, a natural and experimentally tractable host-pathogen system. Aim 2: We will develop a new method for point-of- care detection of Mtb in patient sputum samples using solvatochromic mycomembrane imaging agents. In collaboration with Prof. Bavesh Kana at Univ. Witswatersrand, South Africa, we will field test the method by analysis of sputum samples collected from HIV-1 coinfected and uninfected TB patients as well as naïve and drug-treated TB patients. Aim 3: Finally, we will explore how mycobacteria's unusual property of asymmetric growth contributes to virulence and drug sensitivity in vivo by imaging PG in the M. marinum/zebrafish infection model. Achievement of these aims will provide new insights into TB drug action and resistance, and deliver a new clinical tool for accurate diagnosis and drug efficacy monitoring."

"9047656","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary etiologic factors leading to the sporadic (non-familial) form of the lethal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain unknown. The National ALS Registry collects information on environmental risk factors from patients who register through the on-line portal. However, it is not known how representative the risk factor data in the National ALS Registry are in comparison with the population of ALS patients as a whole. We will develop a surveillance program that will achieve complete ascertainment of ALS cases in Northern / Central Ohio (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct a population case control study of risk factors for ALS based on data collected with a specially designed environmental questionnaire from the patients collected in the Ohio surveillance program and randomly selected population control subjects from the same region (Specific Aim 2). We will compare ALS patients to random controls with regard to levels of exposure to the cyanobacterial neurotoxin, ?-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), and other environmental toxicants, including lead, mercury and pesticides, as potential risk factors for sporadic ALS. The central hypothesis is that the risk of developing ALS increases with dose and duration of exposure to these risk factors in susceptible individuals. Exposures will be determined by: (i) history of exposure to cyanobacteria and involvement in at-risk occupations, using questionnaire data; (ii) dietary intake of mercury, using questionnaire data on fish consumption and databases of methylmercury in fish; and (iii) the geospatial distribution of residential exposure to environmental toxins/toxicants. Mapping of at-risk exposures will include: (i) lifetime residential histories; (ii) sources of potential environmental toxicants (Brownfield ad Superfund sites, hazardous waste sites, agricultural pesticides) and cyanobacteria in waterbodies (Specific Aim 3). The geographical mapping program will be a case control study of exposures in Ohio ALS surveillance program patients and random controls from the general population. The content of cyanobacteria in waterbodies throughout Northern / Central Ohio will be determined using a combination of direct sampling and aerosol collections from waterbodies, and calibrated satellite remote sensing. Our approach is innovative; it is the first comprehensive ALS surveillance program in Ohio, a state with many hazardous waste sites that also borders Lake Erie, which has massive cyanobacterial blooms; it is the first in-depth analysis of exposure to cyanobacteria as a risk factor for ALS in Ohio; and it is the first comprehensive analysis of th relative risks of the full range of incriminated environmental risk factors for ALS using geospatia mapping. Identifying the specific environmental toxins/toxicants that increase risk of ALS will enable exposure reduction initiatives to prevent this debilitating and lethal disease."
"9145480","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autoimmunity, the aberrant regulation of the immune system, affects an astounding 23.5 million Americans. Autoimmune disease such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are major causes of chronic illness and are expected to rise with increasing prevalence across all ethnic groups. Disruptions in gut microbial communities (dysbiosis) are highly associated with both T1D and IBD; however, the importance of gut microbes as regulators of disease pathophysiology has only recently been highlighted. The interleukin-10 deficient (IL10KO) mouse is a well-established model of IBD; however germ-free (GF) IL10KO mice never develop colonic inflammation. We made the novel discovery that GF IL10KO mice instead develop pancreatic infiltration that remarkably resembles clinical T1D insulitis. The IL10KO model is an exciting opportunity to investigate the role of gut microbes as regulators of immunopathology that mediate T1D and/or the complex interplay between host-microbial interactions and immunological regulation in disease. Determine whether GF IL10KO mice exhibit an increased risk for insulitis associated with Type 1 diabetes and identify the immune mediators in GF IL10KO compared to conventionally-raised counterparts ; [2] Determine the role of gut microbes and mucosal immune function in protection against insulitis in IL10 KO mice. A multidisciplinary approach using immunological, histological, and molecular strategies will identify (1) the window of time insulitis is initiated, (2) specific immune cell types involved in immunopathology, as well as potential biomarkers of disease, and (3) the impact of insulitis on islet architecture and host blood glucose homeostasis. In vivo approaches will test the IBD phenotypes, demonstrating Two central aims are proposed: [1] transferability of autoimmune-mediated pathophysiology via adoptive transfer models and whether introduction of specific microbes at an early window of life protects against insulitis. This model has the potential to open many avenues to discovery in the fields of metabolism, autoimmunity, genetics, and microbiome; and warrants further characterization to investigate mechanisms of disease. The proposed research will provide fundamental information about autoimmune initiation and progression in the pancreas and the premise for preventative probiotic therapies to decrease the incidence of T1D."
"9227704","Summary/Abstract What is known: Liver-to-body mass-ratio is held constant by a phenomenon named the ?hepatostat? [1]. When liver is damaged, an ensuing state of systemic hepatic insufficiency induces regenerative proliferation. A regulatory axis has been uncovered that is dependent on levels of circulating bile acids (BA), which are both synthesized and recycled by hepatocytes. BAs reclaimed from the gut enter the circulation and activate the farnesyl-X-receptor (FXR) in enterocytes (mice) or other cells (human). This induces secretion of FGF15/19 into the enterohepatic circulation [2-4]. At the liver, FGFR-signaling in hepatocytes feedback-regulates BA production by repressing CYP7A1 expression [5] and modulates bioenergetic pathways [6]. In a less-well understood process, BAs and FGF15/19 also coordinately regulate pro- and anti-regeneration activities in the liver. The balance of these activities determines whether the hepatocytes proliferate [7-9]. New insights: It is becoming increasingly recognized that redox signaling participates in many physiological functions. We recently reported that livers of mice in which hepatocytes lack both thioredoxin reductase-1 and glutathione reductase (TR/GR-null) - the entry points to the two major cytosolic antioxidant systems - are 2.1- fold larger than normal [10], suggesting these mice have a mis-calibrated hepatostat. These mice also have elevated BA levels. Surprisingly however, neither cholesterol-free diets nor inhibition of cholesterol synthesis to limit BA precursors, nor treatment with cholestyramine to increase fecal BA excretion, normalize circulating BAs. This suggests that, along with having a defective hepatostat in which pro-regeneration activities predominate, systemic feedback regulation of BA synthesis is disrupted in mice with TR/GR-null livers. What is proposed: Because the TR/GR-null condition is restricted to hepatocytes, we predict that FXR- induced production of FGF15 in enterocytes is normal. We hypothesize that hepatostat- and BA feedback- signals are redox-regulated and therefore disrupted in TR/GR-null hepatocytes. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: Aim 1, to assess enterocytic FGF15 production and hepatocytic activity of FGF15- induced signaling cascades in WT or TR/GR-null livers. Aim 2, to assess protein-Cys modifications on components of the FGFR4-dependent pathways in these livers and determine which of these affect signaling and gene expression outcomes that regulate the hepatostat. Anticipated outcomes and value: BAs function in lipid digestion, toxin-excretion, and the hepatostat. In turn, lipid catabolism, toxin exposure, and regeneration are each associated with increased oxidative stress. In this Exploratory Project, we hypothesize that there are previously unrecognized redox-regulated components on the BA/hepatostat axis that ensure appropriate coordination of these activities with the cellular redox status. Modulation of this could be helpful in therapies addressing liver injuries or toxic exposures."
"9174559","7. Project Summary/Abstract The mechanism of DNA packaging for double-stranded DNA viruses will be studied in the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage ?29, the most efficient in vitro viral packaging system known. Using an integrated genetic, biochemical and structural approach, we will characterize protein conformational change and movement in the transiently assembled packaging motor during DNA encapsidation. The mechanism of packaging in ?29 will serve as a model for animal virus packaging in the analogous herpesvirus and adenovirus systems, and aid in the search for new antiviral therapies. Due to similarities between the ?29 ATPase and other ring translocases, insights gained from the study of ?29 packaging will also provide insight into the basic principles of macromolecular motor function in higher organisms. To interrogate the mechanism of DNA packaging we will: complete and validate the atomic structure of the ?29 packaging motor using X-ray crystallography and cryoEM analysis (Aim 1); elucidate the mechanisms of force generation and intersubunit coordination during DNA translocation in a complex motor using integrated structural, genetic and biochemical approaches (Aim 2); and characterize the molecular events that culminate in termination of packaging using mutagenesis and biochemical analysis and cryoEM analysis (Aim 3)."

The mentoring team is comprised of experienced faculty who possess the necessary expertise to assist the candidate in accomplishing the proposed research. The significant institutional commitment on the part of the Departments of Ophthalmology and Neurobiology and ongoing mentoring from scientists and clinicians who are dedicated to his long term success will ensure a successful transition to an independent R01-funded research program. Research: Retinal edema (RE) causes vision loss in numerous retinal disorders including diabetes, vein occlusion, and uveitis. While anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents and corticosteroids often improve RE, they are not universally effective, often resulting in incomplete vision recovery. Retinal edema results from a combination of leaking retinal blood vessels and loss of MG pump function which removes fluid from the retina. The central hypothesis is that cysts seen in RE represent swollen MG and that this swelling is caused by inability of MG to export fluid, termed MG pump dysfunction. To explore our conceptual hypothesis, we have developed a mouse model of cystic RE in experimental laser-induced retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Preliminary data demonstrate that RVO produces retinal thickening and development of cystic spaces in the retina. MG in the RVO-affected area show redistribution of water (AQP4) and potassium (Kir4.1) channels and increased cellular cross sectional area, suggesting intracellular fluid accumulation. These features occur in association with mitochondrial dysfunction, and we find that prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction reduces AQP4/Kir4.1 redistribution. Based on these observations, the model of RVO-induced retinal edema will be used to test two specific hypotheses (1) AQP4/ Kir4.1 redistribution following RVO causes MG swelling, which is driven by the inability of MG to export imbibed fluid; and (2) RVO causes MG mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in AQP4/Kir4.1 redistribution and MG pump dysfunction."
"9154868","Project Summary/Abstract Human stem cells have the power, or ?potency? to turn into any type of cell in the body (Noggle, et al. 2005). Because many conditions or events, such as Parkinson's disease and heart attacks, are characterized by damage to or death of specific cell types, it may be possible to use stem cells to treat these conditions (Edlinger, 2015; Pantcheva, et al. 2015). However, there is a great deal about stem cells that needs to be understood before these advances can be made, and this project addresses questions about how stem cells turn into other cell types. One major hurdle in achieving the full power of stem cell therapies is to understand how stem cells transition from one cell type into another. We know that a major part of this process is that different genes, parts of your DNA that control how a cell functions, are active, inactive, or somewhere in between. We also know that whether a gene is active or inactive depends on other segments of the DNA called enhancers, which act like dimmer switches for how active a gene is (Kaikkonen, et al. 2013). Although we know that enhancers regulate genes, we do not completely understand how enhancers themselves are regulated. There are groups of molecules, or protein complexes, in the cell that function at enhancers like the finger on a dimmer switch, changing how much an enhancer activates or inactivates a gene (Hu, 2011). One of these complexes is referred to as the SWI/SNF complex. How the SWI/SNF complex targets specific enhancers, and how it makes enhancers more or less likely to activate a gene, are largely open questions. What makes the problem more complicated is that the specific components of the complex are not always the same (Wang, et al. 1996). Our lab thinks that the specific proteins that make up the SWI/SNF complex help target it to certain enhancers and affects whether the enhancer causes the gene it regulates to be more or less active. If we can understand how enhancers are affected by the SWI/SNF complex, we will have a better understanding of how a cell activates and inactivates certain genes and therefore how stem cells can be changed into one cell type versus another. Therefore, the aims of this proposal are as follows: Aim 1: Test whether the different components of the SWI/SNF complex differentially regulate human stem cell enhancers. Aim 2: Determine the specific roles of SWI/SNF components in regulating enhancer characteristics that make them more or less likely to regulate gene activity. Aim 3: Design a computational model to predict in what way enhancers are regulated by the components of the SWI/SNF complex."
"9320318","Project Summary Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are plasticizers used in the manufacturing of many household and personal care products (e.g., BPA is used in the coating of the inside surface of metal cans). These compounds can have estrogenic and inflammatory properties that could increase the risk of breast cancer. Breast density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. In a recent study, high circulating levels of BPA and monoethyl phthalate (MEP) were significantly associated with higher levels of mammographic breast density. For both compounds, breast density was about five percentage points higher among women with serum levels above the median detectable level compared with women with undetectable levels. A comparable percentage- point difference in breast density has been linked with a 5 to 10% increase in breast cancer risk in other epidemiologic studies. Concerns about the serum assay used in the BPA/phthalate-breast density study and the single time-point exposure measurement have led to controversy over its findings although it is not clear how a spurious positive association could have emerged. Further research is clearly needed to verify the findings, especially since the underlying mechanism is not understood. The fact that high MEP urinary levels were also associated with a four-fold increased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women in a case- control study conducted in Mexico, and that a recent case-control study conducted in Canada observed striking associations between breast cancer risk in premenopausal women and employment in plastics manufacturing and in food canning further underscore the need for research in this area. We hypothesize that high exposure to BPA and some phthalates results in increased inflammation in the breast microenvironment that contributes to increased breast density and breast cancer susceptibility. In an innovative study approach, we will examine the relation between urinary and milk levels of BPA/phthalate metabolites, inflammatory markers in the breast, and breast density in 250 nursing first time mothers. Urinary levels of BPA and 12 phthalate metabolites will be measured at two time points: six weeks after birth [T0] and six months after cessation of breastfeeding [T1]. Breast milk levels of BPA and key breast inflammatory markers will also be measured at T0. Non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to assess percent dense volume at T1. The unique strengths of this study are the multiple time-point exposure measurements, the selection of accepted matrices to measure these chemicals, the ability to examine the potential inflammatory effects of these chemicals directly in the breast microenvironment, and the opportunity to examine risk in a diverse population of young women."
"9146902","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Workers under the age of 25 have an increased risk of workplace violence compared to all workers combined. Given their predominant employment in the high-risk retail and service industries, the lack of violence prevention programs in these industries, and the fact that youth may be uniquely affected by workplace violence due to their ongoing physical and psychological development, young workers are a vulnerable population at risk. Our current understanding of workplace violence in this population largely comes from occupational injury surveillance data. However, data from these systems underestimate the prevalence of violence and lack information about perpetrators, event circumstances, psychological harms, distal consequences of violence (e.g., job loss, poor academic achievement) and exposure to workplace violence prevention training. Therefore, to adequately investigate workplace violence among youth, alternative methodological approaches are needed. We propose a national telephone survey with a representative sample of 1000 US youth 15-24 years of age to accomplish the following aims: 1) to estimate the prevalence of workplace violence victimization among young workers and characterize cases by employment-, worker-, and event-characteristics; 2) to characterize employer-provided workplace violence prevention training received by young workers; 3) to identify risk factors for workplace violence victimization among young workers; and 4) to describe the employment and educational consequences of workplace violence victimization among young workers and examine associations between these outcomes and worker and event characteristics. The proposed work addresses the NORA cross-sector program on Traumatic Injury (Goal 3: Reduce occupational injuries and deaths due to workplace violence; Goal 5: Reduce occupational injuries and deaths among high risk and vulnerable worker groups). It also addresses NORA's Service sector program (Goal 11: By 2015, reduce the frequency of workplace violence events by 20% in restaurants and food delivery services.) The following are the major contributions of the proposed study, several of which will directly contribute to the achievement of the above NORA goals: 1) this study will produce a more accurate estimate of workplace violence victimization prevalence among workers under age 25 than surveillance methods have been able to achieve; 2) it will provide the first workplace violence risk factor data focused on young worker populations; 3) it will provide details on the content and quantity of workplace violence training young workers receive from their employers; and 4) it will generate some of the first data on the more distal consequences that experiencing workplace violence can have on youth's employment and education. Near-term outputs from the proposed work will include presentations at national conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and access to the national survey data."
"9272242","Cognitive impairment and dementia are common and disabling problems in patients with neurodegenerations characterized by intraneuronal ?-synuclein (?-Syn) aggregates. These patients are classified clinically as either Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) or as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). This labeling distinction is based on the order of presentation of parkinsonism versus dementia ? in PDD, the movement disorder occurs first, while in DLB, the cognitive impairment occurs first or within 1-year of parkinsonism onset. PDD and DLB exhibit virtually identical pathological findings at autopsy. Abnormalities found include pathological depositions of ?-Syn, A?-amyloid, and tau proteins, the latter as intraneuronal paired helical filaments or ?neurofibrillary tangles? (NFT). In individual brains, ?-Syn alone may be present in cell bodies (Lewy bodies) or in synaptic terminals (Lewy neurites). In other brains, ?-Syn deposits are present together with A?-amyloid plaques. In still other brains, ?-Syn, A?-amyloid and tau NFT pathologies are all present, often diagnosed neuropathologically as Alzheimer disease (AD) with PD. The neuropathologic findings do not, however, correlate substantially with subject clinical classification as PDD versus DLB. The future development of effective therapy for dementia in ?-synucleinopathy will likely require targeting of the pathologic pathways involved, and this in turn, necessitates ability to determine the type(s) of pathology present in individual patients and assessment of which pathologies most strongly drive progression of cognitive impairments. To be effective in disease modification, therapies will require testing and application in patients with only mild symptoms. In the present proposal, we will determine endophenotypes of mild dementia in patients with ?-synucleinopathy, employing multi-tracer molecular brain imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). We will determine the presence of ?- Syn neuropathology on the basis of [11C]dihydroteterabenazine (DTBZ) PET imaging of nigrostriatal projection integrity. We will identify the presence of A?-amyloid plaque deposition with [11C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET imaging, and the presence of tau NFT pathology with [18F]AV1451 (formerly designated T807) PET imaging. Together, these imaging results will permit classification of each subject as: ?pure? synucleinopathy, or synucleinopathy with A?-amyloid, or as synucleinopathy with both A?-amyloid and tau. We will test the hypothesis that the progression of cognitive decline will be more rapid in the synucleinopathy with both A?-amyloid and tau endophenotype, and that the progression of cognitive impairment in subjects with this endophenotype will correlate with the progression of NFT pathology as determined in follow-up [18F]AV1451-PET. The development of reliable trait biomarkers of neurodegenerative pathologies in PDD and DLB will enable progress in the development and assessment of new therapeutic interventions desperately needed in these syndromes."
"9339441","Complete annotation of all functional sequences in the human genome remains a major challenge a decade after its initial sequencing. This pertains in particular to gene regulatory elements, many of which are located far away from their target genes, but play fundamental roles in human biology. Significant progress towards annotation of the gene regulatory architecture has been made in recent years predominantly using cultured human cells. However, large-scale studies in mice, as well as anecdotal examples identified in human studies, have indicated the existence of large populations of gene regulatory sequences with very restricted temporal and tissue-specific activity during mammalian development. Despite their critical importance in human development and disease, this set of regulatory sequences will likely be missed by approaches restricted to cell lines or adult tissues. To fill this gap, the major objective for this U54 application is to generate catalogs of developmentally active gene regulatory sequences using existing high throughput data production pipelines for genomic approaches including ChlP-Seq, MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq on embryonic tissues. Performing such studies directly on human tissues is not feasible due to limited availability of human embryos at relevant stages of development. We will therefore in this study exploit the laboratory mouse, a widely used animal model that shares a similar embryonic developmental program and gene regulatory architecture with humans. In addition to embryonic development, our studies will also generate a complementary reference dataset from postnatal and adult mice to better understand the dynamics of gene regulation over time. Furthermore, we will assess the biological authenticity of identified regulatory sequences by in-depth functional validation using an established transgenic mouse pipeline. It is anticipated that generation of these datasets will fill a major void in the functional annotation o a mammalian genome and help to complete the catalog of gene regulatory sequences in the human genome."
"9179019","PROJECT SUMMARY Owing to the heightened risk of medication errors during patient care transitions, the ?meaningful use? of the EHR Medication Reconciliation functionality, has potential to significantly improve quality & patient safety, and reduce healthcare costs. Despite the federal policy impetus towards EHR Medication Reconciliation however, hospital adherence has lagged for one chief reason?low physician engagement?which in part, stems from lack of professional consensus about which physician is responsible for managing a patient's medication list and the value of medication reconciliation as a clinical tool for improving quality of care.  GR Health has recently launched certified EHR technology throughout its health system. Like many hospitals, a key challenge faced by GR Health is that physicians who did not place the original order for a patient's medication, are resistant to completing EHR Medication Reconciliation at discharge, leading to frustrated patients with incomplete medication lists and higher-than-expected medication error rates.  This pilot/feasibility project seeks to implement a Social Knowledge Networking (SKN) system to enable GR Health to progress from ?limited use? of EHR Medication Reconciliation technology, to ?meaningful use.? Step 1 (Development Phase) will be to enhance an existing SKN system (Microsoft-Yammer's) capability to promote EHR medication reconciliation; and integrate the tool into the EHR workflow at GR Health. Step 2 (Pilot Phase) will be to conduct a pilot/feasibility test of the SKN system in the outpatient & inpatient settings at GR Health. Specific aims are to examine: 1) user-engagement in the SKN system through SKN user surveys & SKN usage analytics; and 2) preliminary associations between ?SKN use? and ?EHR meaningful use.?  The rationale is that an SKN system would bring together a diverse group of practitioners (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, IT specialists, and administrators), to facilitate the exchange of tacit knowledge (practice- based knowledge) on the problem of interest. Tacit knowledge exchange in turn, is expected to increase practitioners' engagement in solving the problem, promote learning, and enable practice change (i.e., EHR meaningful use). The pilot study would include 6 SKN Moderators (senior administrators & MD champions) and 60 SKN Users (practitioners) from the outpatient & inpatient medicine service. The hypothesis is that proactive, periodic ?top-down? efforts of SKN Moderators to promote EHR Medication Reconciliation would synergize with ?bottom-up? exchange of tacit knowledge by SKN Users, to enable engagement, learning, and meaningful use.  The project is highly responsive to the FOA, since it seeks to test a strategy for health IT use, implementation, and design, which in turn is aligned with three of AHRQ's five health IT research priorities. If the hypothesis holds, federal EHR vendors could be encouraged to incorporate SKN features into EHR systems. The study will utilize a range of quantitative, qualitative, and social network analytic techniques to examine SKN user engagement, SKN usability, SKN usage analytics, and EHR meaningful use."
