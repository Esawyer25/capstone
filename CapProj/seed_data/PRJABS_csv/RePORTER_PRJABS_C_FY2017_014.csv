"9372331","Title: Southeast Regional Center of Excellence in Vector-Borne Disease: The Gateway Program SUMMARY This Center of Excellence initiative is led by renowned, highly collaborative investigators from four major partnering universities in Florida with strong vector biology programs (University of Florida, University of Miami, University of South Florida and Florida International University). This integrated academic network carries the full support of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Florida Department of Health, and the Florida Mosquito Control Association, representing a vast system of 59 Mosquito Control Districts. Collaborating institutes include Florida A&M University, Georgia Southern University, the USDA-ARS Center for Medical, Agricultural & Veterinary Entomology, the Naval Entomology Center of Excellence, and The Scripps Research Institute-Florida. Our proposal leverages the expertise across a broad remit of vector biology and epidemiological disciplines to achieve the following overarching objectives: (1) Conduct an innovative, applied research program to develop novel control interventions and optimize surveillance paradigms that would allow mosquito control associations throughout Florida and the US to better anticipate and respond to vector-borne disease (VBD) outbreaks; (2) Establish an integrated research and training network between academic institutions throughout Florida and the Southeast and the local, state, and federal public health agencies, to facilitate existing and future efforts in VBD surveillance and control; (3) Expand an effective University of Florida-led training program in basic public health entomology and advanced vector biology to augment the cohort of personnel who are trained with the requisite knowledge and skills to quickly detect and respond to VBDs; and (4) Provide an evidence-based set of recommendations and a tailored template of a ?surveillance-response program? to ensure that local mosquito control associations can better predict and address VBD threats in the US. The proposal is extremely timely as Florida is currently ?ground zero? for transmission of Zika and Dengue and offers an opportunity to examine the biocomplexity of such diseases in real-time. As such, the partnering research powerhouses in the State stand ready to tackle the problem through an integrated, data-driven, applied research and training program; designed to produce maximal output in novel control interventions and training paradigms within a 5-year period. Importantly, there is strong vision for this Center of Excellence in VBD. Through a multi-tier training program, we not only tackle the shortage of individuals trained in public health entomology today, but effectively lay down the framework for developing the leaders in this field over years to come. The ultimate goal is to establish a bona fide, comprehensive, applied and basic research program that fully addresses the epidemiological triad that will underpin our understanding of vector borne disease transmission. This is embodied in the proposed Gateway Program; the ?Gatekeeper template? for effective control and prevention of VBD establishment and spread throughout the United States."
"9245975","PROJECT SUMMARY More than 2 million infants die every year from infections, particularly the very young in resource-poor settings. Moreover, due to distinct immunity, newborns are less apt to mount protective immune responses to most vaccines. Improvement of newborn immunization thus requires a better biological understanding of vaccine- induced immune responses that correspond to protection. HIPC Project 1 proposes an innovative systems biological investigation to gain a more holistic view of vaccine-induced immunity. We will use novel advanced statistical and computational approaches to analyze very large and unbiased datasets of molecular and cellular information measured from small samples of blood obtained from newborns undergoing immunization with hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), given with or without Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). The molecular datasets will consist of precise measurements of tens of thousands of gene expression read-outs (gene transcripts [RNA] and proteins) that will be generated using state-of-the-art methods and instruments, such as next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) and mass spectrometry (Service Cores 1 & 2, and Data Management Core). Our preliminary data, derived from analyses of West African cohorts in Guinea Bissau and MRC-Gambia, demonstrate feasibility of measuring transcriptomic and proteomic endpoints in small volumes of newborn peripheral blood and suggest Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccine-induced molecular signatures in early life. Molecular response signatures and biomarker classifiers that predict subsequent immunogenicity, especially correlates of protection (CoP) against infection, will be identified. Innovative bioinformatics-based and data-driven biomarker integration approaches will reveal patterns of gene expression, bionetworks, molecular pathways and biomarker classifiers associated with successful immunization, and/or sub-optimal immunogenicity. We will achieve our goal by pursuing the following Specific Aims: in Specific Aim 1, we will identify blood transcriptomic signatures in human newborns that correlate with effective immunization, using pre- and post-vaccine whole blood RNA-Seq datasets both in vitro (in vitro modeling HIPC Project 3) and in vivo; in Specific Aim 2, we will identify human newborn blood plasma and cellular proteomic signatures in vitro and in vivo that correlate with effective immunization, using proteomic datasets that are study participant- and time-matched to the RNA-Seq datasets (Specific Aim 1); and in Specific Aim 3, we will further develop and use statistical and computational approaches to allow integration across the in vitro and in vivo transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, including with the high-end flow cytometry analyses that will define cellular subtypes in blood (HIPC Project 2). Innovative bioinformatics and biostatistics will further refine and discover new molecular/cellular signatures associated with HBV CoP, mechanisms of action of HBV and potential adjuvanticity of BCG vaccine, thereby informing future development of neonatal vaccines."
"9124294","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Along with the proposed research project, the training plan will address gaps in immunology training and aid in development of professional skills needed to become an independent research scientist. Didactic courses in immunology will address gaps in basic knowledge, while quarterly meetings with a mentoring team comprised of faculty members with a focus in vaccine research and immunology will help guide my work. Attending vaccine and immunology focused conferences and discussion of current topics in immunology with peers will further strengthen immunology skills needed to be successful in vaccine research. Additionally, feedback from quarterly meetings with a mentoring team, participation in several professional development workshops and programs, and presenting research at multiple conferences will aid in development of professional skills necessary to conduct independent research.  Moraxella catarrhalis is a leading cause of otitis media and exacerbations of COPD, two diseases that cause tremendous human suffering and economic burden worldwide. PCR-based detection has revealed severe underestimation of M. catarrhalis in otitis media. Furthermore, the lack of identified correlates of protection against M. catarrhali and lack of groups working on this organism has contributed to the delay in the development of an M. catarrhalis vaccine. The proposed project will address this gap in the field by examining the role of humoral and cellular immunity against M. catarrhalis following vaccination with OppA, a promising vaccine antigen. Therefore, the goal of Aim 1 is to identify protective B cell responses by assessing the antibody response to OppA in humans and OppA-vaccinated animals; the goal of Aim 2 is to identify protective T cell responses in mice immunized with OppA. The completion of the proposed studies will advance the field and aid in development of an M. catarrhalis vaccine to prevent otitis media and exacerbations of COPD."
"9245195","Millions of infants are born to women who experience infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria during pregnancy. Although repeated malaria infections during childhood promote the acquisition of immunity to malaria, exposure to malaria antigens in utero might have the opposite effect. Observational studies suggest that malaria detected at delivery either from the maternal blood or the placenta is associated with increased risk of malaria in the infant. Conclusions from previous observational studies are limited because they cannot control for potential confounders, such as risk factors common to mother and infant such as environment and genetic factors that may impact the risk of malaria infection and severity of disease. Alteration in infant susceptibility to malaria is attributed to the development of fetal immune tolerance in response to in utero exposure to malaria proteins and characterized by increased frequency of T regulatory cells and a Th2-skewed cytokine milieu. This tolerant phenotype could have important health implications for infants by increasing susceptibility to malaria infection and interfering with infants' ability to respond to a malaria vaccine. We will study the infants born to mothers who participate in a clinical trial comparing sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, a drug compromised by widespread resistance, to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, a highly effective, long acting therapy, for the prevention of malaria during pregnancy. The former treatment arm is likely to allow women to develop malaria infection during pregnancy and the latter is expected to prevent all infections. Thus, the in utero exposure of the infants to malaria differ randomly. By examining cord blood responses and the subsequent risk of malaria during infancy, we will determine if prenatal exposure to malaria is responsible for increased susceptibility to malaria during infancy and if the perturbation of the neonatal immune response is the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. The results will be timely. Alternatives to the currently recommended regimen for preventing malaria during pregnancy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are currently being evaluated and the impact existing or new interventions have on infant health and survival may be important factors to consider. In addition, understanding the maternal conditions that prime the fetal immune system to develop a tolerant response may improve our ability to develop vaccines to protect against malaria and other infectious diseases for children in malaria-endemic countries."
"9372282","Northeast Regional Center of Excellence in Vector Borne Diseases. Project summary/abstract Over the decades, strong training in medical entomology and vector borne disease epidemiology has waned, limiting the number of knowledgeable and well trained professionals available to respond to vector borne disease emergencies in our constantly changing world. In addition, resources and organization of basic applied research that could lead to improvements in vector surveillance and control has been limited, and public health programs have been fractious and often uncoordinated across regions. In this proposal, we outline a research and training agenda that will address these gaps and fill critical needs through the development of a highly integrative Regional Center of Excellence in Vector Borne Diseases. We will accomplish these goals across 3 Specific Aims to (1) conduct applied research to develop and validate effective vector borne disease prevention and control tools and methods necessary to anticipate and respond to disease outbreaks; (2) train a cadre of public health entomologists with the knowledge and skills required to rapidly detect, prevent and respond to vector-borne disease threats in the United States; and (3) build effective collaborations between academic communities and public health organizations at federal, state, and local levels for vector borne disease surveillance, response and prevention. Innovations for our Center include an integrated degree program, postdoctoral cross-training and needs assessment-driven workshops. In addition, our collaborative applied research efforts, decades-long surveillance efforts and biological data records, combined with new research approaches proposed herein, will enable us to address important problems in a new and unique way. We have assembled a highly accomplished and talented collaborative team of experts representing the spectrum of essential skills necessary to carry out our proposed goals for the CDC Northeast Regional Center of Excellence in Vector Borne Diseases."

"9406519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rotator cuff tears of the shoulder result in annual economic burden of $3-4 billion in surgical expenses alone and have major impact on individual quality of life. Suture repair is the standard of care but high re- tear rates have been reported. Extracellular matrix (ECM) augmentation scaffolds are used to try and improve outcomes for massive tears because they contain bioactive molecules that stimulate cell migration, proliferation and ECM synthesis. However, there are limitations to all the currently available scaffolds and they do not recreate the native tendon-to-bone interface, a graded tendon-fibrocartilage-bone composite tissue which functions to reduce stress concentration at the tendon insertion. Therefore there is a need for a device that more closely recapitulates structure and function of the native tendon-bone interface. Our overall goal is to develop a biomaterial scaffold that promotes integrated tendon-to-bone formation for use in rotator cuff repair. To achieve this goal, we will take an innovative approach to challenge the current paradigm for scaffold development. In addition to ECM cues, other microenvironmental factors such as scaffold microarchitecture can control stem cell differentiation and the formation of complex tissues. For example, electrospinning can be used to form fibers with controllable fiber alignment patterns and diameters, each of which induces specific differentiation responses by stem cells. The current paradigm of scaffold development involves selecting several candidate scaffolds, examining cell behavior in response to culture on these scaffolds, and then modifying scaffold design based on the results obtained before repeating the process. With this approach, there is limited ability to independently manipulate and integrate microenvironmental variables (e.g. scaffold fiber diameter and anisotropy, cell-adhesive ECM ligands) that critically affect cel differentiation and the functional properties of resulting tissue. Therefore, our understanding of how scaffold microenvironments affect functional outcomes remains limited, and identifying scaffold conditions that promote functional composite tissue formation is a highly inefficient process. To overcome these limitations, we intend to use an in vitro micro-photopatterning (microPP) technique to systematically screen scaffold fiber diameter and anisotropy for desired effects on stem cell differentiation towards tendon, cartilage and bone. We will then further functionalize the microPP architectures with tendon-, cartilage- and bone-specific ECM to evaluate additional benefit conferred with the integration of ECM specific ligands. Finally, we wil apply these findings to a multi-layered electrospun scaffold that will be evaluated in vitro for it ability to promote development of a vertically graded tendon- fibrocartilage-bone interface, similar to that seen at the normal tendon-bone interface of the rotator cuff. These findings will improve understanding of microenvironmental cues for tendon-bone tissue engineering and are expected to improve tissue engineered regeneration of the rotator cuff tendon-bone interface."
"9387555","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  All blood cell types that make up the adult cardiovascular system are created and maintained by self-renewing, multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Conserved across vertebrates, HSPCs are specified early in development, arising from a unique population of vascular cells called the hemogenic endothelium. Given the difficulties in the ex vivo differentiation and expansion of HSPCs from pluripotent stem cells for regenerative therapies, it is readily apparent that knowledge about HSPC specification is significantly lacking. This gap in understanding stems from the challenges in visualizing HSPC emergence in mammalian embryos that develop internally. The proposed study will address these biological problems with the zebrafish model because the transparency and external fertilization of zebrafish embryos will allow for the molecular dissection of the mechanisms that control this dynamic endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) in vivo.  Small, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of stem cell and cardiovascular biology because of their ability to post-transcriptionally silence a diverse array of target genes.  While miRNA regulation is crucial for HSPC self-renewal, maintenance, and differentiation into multiple lineages, the role for miRNAs in hemogenic endothelial specification and HSC emergence is largely unexplored. From a reverse genetic screen to identify the cardiovascular function of endothelial-enriched miRNAs in zebrafish, mir-223 was identified as a novel candidate regulator of HSPC specification because the loss of mir-223 led to an expansion of HSPCs at the onset of HSPC induction. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to directly test the hypothesis that mir-223 functions to negatively regulate the transition from endothelial to hematopoietic cell fates. By employing an innovative strategy to create a mir-223 fluorescent reporter, mir-223 localization patterns will be assessed for the first time in vivo and correlated with the dynamic emergence of HSPCs from the hemogenic endothelium in zebrafish. The proposed research will also examine whether mir-223 functions in HSPC production by visualizing changes in hemogenic endothelial specification and cellular behaviors of emerging HSPCs when mir-223 activity is lost or elevated. Finally, the genes that are directly targeted by mir-223 during EHT will be identified by their upregulation in mir-223 mutants compared to wildtype hemogenic endothelial cells. Altogether, this proposed work will implicate miRNA regulation as a fundamental mechanism of HSPC specification, and will better define the genetic network regulating this process. Importantly, these studies will establish the zebrafish mir-223 mutant as a new leukemogenesis animal model, and will have the potential to instruct regenerative medicine approaches in the ex vivo production of HSPCs for the treatment of leukemia and other blood disorders."
"9307266","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regulation of chromosome structure is important for normal cell function and is often disrupted in disease. Condensins are evolutionarily conserved, multi-subunit protein complexes that are essential for chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division and play key roles in transcription regulation and DNA repair. Most organisms contain two types of condensins, which perform different functions and localize to different chromosomal regions. C. elegans contains a third type of condensin that specifically binds to and represses X chromosome transcription to accomplish dosage compensation within the dosage compensation complex (DCC). It is not known how condensins are targeted to their binding sites, and how they regulate chromosome structure and transcription. Our goal is to address this significant gap in our knowledge by determining the mechanism of DCC binding and function in C. elegans. C. elegans DCC serves as an excellent experimental model to study condensin binding and function. DCC is recruited specifically to the X chromosome and represses transcription of both X chromosomes in XX hermaphrodites to equalize overall X-linked transcript levels to that of XO males. DCC is first targeted to X- specific recruitment site, and then spreads onto physically connected chromatin. Spreading gives rise to ~90% of the DCC binding sites along the X. Majority of these sites are at active gene promoters. There is no direct relationship between DCC binding and repression, thus DCC may regulate genes at long-range. Important gaps in our understanding of DCC mechanism is the relation between DCC binding and transcription at the local and global level, and the molecular mechanism by which the DCC spreads onto the chromosome. The objective of this application is to 1) test if DCC binding is sufficient and required for repression, 2) determine the role of H4K20me1 in DCC binding 3) determine how the DCC affects chromosome structure of the X. We will accomplish these objectives by analyzing the effects of ectopic DCC binding, DCC binding site deletions, X chromosome duplications and measure DCC localization, gene expression and chromosome structure genome-wide using ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and 4C-seq, respectively. At the completion of our project we will have a better understanding of a persistent question: how do condensins bind to chromosomes and affect its structure and function. This is relevant to health, because chromosome structure and condensin function is essential for proper chromosome segregation, transcription, and DNA repair, processes that are disrupted in cancers and developmental diseases."
"9186981","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Administrative Core provides administrative services to the three projects and two other cores of this program project. The program project proposal brings together the unique talents of several groups to perform an integrative and interdisciplinary analysis of the mechanism by which p66Shc-deficiency extends lifespan, across several levels of biological organization, and utilizing analyses of many different types that generate data in multiple formats. The Administrative Core is central to the synergistic interaction of the projects and cores, and in fact has demonstrated the facilitation of research transactions between these groups since the proposal's original submission. As a result of this synergistic interaction, the program has generated multiple new hypotheses for She function. Through this coordination over the last 4.5 years, the research conducted by the program project has demonstrated that Shcs control adiposity, metabolism, insulin signaling, and stress resistance, and the Administrative Core has facilitated the publication of >64 manuscripts from our laboratories. The Specific Aims of this core are: to 1) provide an organizational structure to expedite and coordinate research and promote interactions among investigators; 2) monitor and regularly review the quality of research and prepare progress reports; 3) manage the fiscal components of the program project; 4) facilitate publications, presentations, and the dissemination of research results; 5) organize annual meetings by project members and an external review committee; and 6) coordinate and monitor data and resource sharing. Central to how these Aims will be achieved, Core A will organize and manage the monthly teleconference, the weekly lab meetings, the annual External Advisory Committee meeting, and the web-based server for data interchange between the seven units."
"9236548","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and squamous precancers in-situ (CIS, also known as actinic keratoses), are the most common of all human neoplasias and contribute significantly to the national healthcare burden. While existing techniques such as cryoablation or surgical excision are generally curative, those treatments cause scarring that can be especially disfiguring in patients at high risk for skin cancer (i.e., patients with chronic severe photodamage; immunosuppression due to organ transplantation; or Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, BCNS). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin PpIX, induced by the administration of aminolevulic acid, ALA) with activation by visible light, and is a completely nonscarring technique. PDT is approved by the FDA for field treatment of widespread cutaneous precancers, and in European countries PDT is also approved for treating SCC and BCC. In the U.S. however, approval of PDT for SCC and BCC will require further clinical trials to demonstrate an efficacy similar to existing techniques (destructive ablation). As a new way to increase PDT efficacy, we showed that in animal models of SCC and BCC, transient administration of Vitamin D (VD) prior to ALA-PDT enhances PpIX accumulation and PDT efficacy. The oral (dietary) form of VD (cholecalciferol; D3, given as 10,000 IU/day for 10 days) increases PDT-induced tumor killing by several fold, and is very safe with little risk for inducing hypercalcemia. In this grant, we propose to test this approach in human clinical trials using oral D3 as a neoadjuvant to PDT. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between VD status (serium 25OH-D3) and PDT efficacy for CIS. Subaim 1a is a longitudinal study to test the correlation between serum 25OH-D3 levels and treatment outcomes in routine PDT patients in our clinics, and to examine the predictive value of certain biomarkers (e.g. VDR allelic polymorphisms). Subaim 1b is an interventional trial to assess the benefit of giving neoadjuvant D3 (transient oral D3) prior to PDT. Results from combined D3/PDT treatment (Subaim 1b) will be compared to results after D3 alone (Subaim 1a), stratified by the VD deficiency status. In Aim 2, we will examine the potential benefit of neoadjuvant D3/PDT in patients with BCNS (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome). These patients, who have multiple BCC tumors will receive 3 bimonthly PDT treatments, and rates of tumor shrinkage will be correlated with serum 25OH-D3 levels. Each patient will serve as his/her own control by randomizing the order of the first two PDT treatments, one session to be done with neoadjuvant D3 and the other without. The third PDT treatment will occur after the serum VD level has been adjusted to normal levels with D3 supplements. This approach will allow us to determine whether neoadjuvant D3/PDT can help all patients, even the VD deficient individuals, through customization of D3 dose. Together, we expect this group of clinical trials to establish the foundation for a new treatment modality, i.e., neoadjuvant D3/PDT for skin cancer. The potential benefit for public health is that data showing improved efficacy of PDT with this safe and simple approach will lay the foundation for a nonscarring alternative to surgery for early SCC and BCC tumors."
"9186986","She knockout (KO) mice have multiple features of healthy aging, including reduced adiposity, resistance to high-fat diets, stress resistance, and increased stem cell renewal capacity. She mice have increased median longevity on a calorie-restricted diet, and have increased survival on high-fat diets in a pilot study. There are multiple metabolic similarities observed in common among ShcKO and CR mice: reduced insulin levels, decreased glucose levels, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased oxidation of carbohydrates, and increased oxidation of lipids and proteins. Thus we have multiple goals in Project 2: 1) to identify the mechanism(s) by which ShcKO mice resist adiposity and stress, 2) to understand the mechanism by which She depletion extends median lifespan on CR, and 3) to identify She-inhibitory drugs that could be used to improve insulin signaling and healthy aging.     Impact and Significance. The research will have substantial impact. First, we as Westerners live in a high fat environment, and| obesity and diabetes and their consequent co morbidities of stroke and cardiovascular disease are a massive health problem for aging Americans. Thus, identifying anti-adiposity mechanisms in She mice could have important implications reducing adiposity and extending health span in humans. Second, longevity-inducing mutations in the insulin/lgf-1 pathway and CR appear to share some similarities of mechanism, and CR inhibits Shcs. Thus we suspect that CR and She mechanisms at least partially overlap, which is supported by the increased median lifespan of ShcKO mice on CR. Third, She mutant mice and their cells are resistant to multiple stressors and appear to have altered autophagy and increased stem cell regeneration, which could have benefit in understanding the mechanisms of age-related stress resistance. Finally, screening has the potential to identify novel She-inhibitory drugs to translate the healthy aging of ShcKO mice to humans. Thus we plan to have an impact on the mechanisms for resistance to adiposity and diabetes, and the identification of small molecules and diets that promote healthy aging in humans."
"9391143","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad goal of the proposed research is to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hemophilia B. The blood coagulation cascade is a complex biochemical system that is regulated extensively in order to achieve hemostasis without inducing thrombosis. A key component in the activation and regulation of sustained coagulation is a protein complex known as the intrinsic Xase. This complex consists of the Factor IXa (fIXa) enzyme, along with its allosteric activator Factor VIIIa (fVIIIa) and several metal ions which also modulate its activity. Hemophilia B is caused by dysfunction of fIXa, the catalytic subunit of the intrinsic Xase. A specific subset of mutations tht cause hemophilia B do not affect the concentration of fIXa in the blood and do not significantly destabilize the protein. However, these mutations do impair the catalytic function of fIXa. We hypothesize that these mutations perturb conformational equilibria that are critical for allosteric  communication, substrate binding, and enzymatic turnover. In order to test this hypothesis, we will first dissect allosteric communication pathways in fIXa using multi-temperature X-ray crystallography and computational approaches. These analyses will identify correlated conformational heterogeneity and energetic coupling between distal regions of the enzyme. Next, we will apply this same methodology to fIXa point mutants that are associated with hemophilia B. Combined with functional assays, this information will allow us to quantitatively understand how mutational perturbations to the conformational ensemble effect enzymatic activity. Finally, we will rationally engineer fIXa mutations whose effects suppress the disease phenotype in hemophilia B variants. This strategy of rescuing function by restoring the native fIXa conformational ensemble will inform future development of therapeutics by identifying allosteric networks that can be targeted with small molecules. Looking forward, the methodology of biophysical rescue that we will establish can be applied to other genetic diseases that result from single point mutations."
"9250361","Pathological hypertrophy is a common predecessor to heart failure (HF). The heart also grows in response to exercise but this growth, termed physiological hypertrophy, does not generally lead to adverse consequences and can even protect the heart against pathological stress. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of why cardiac hypertrophy can have such divergent outcomes. Our over-arching hypothesis is that there are distinct forms of hypertrophy, which may appear superficially similar but have dramatically different likelihoods of progressing to HF. Our long-term goal is to understand the pathways responsible for these differences and learn whether they can be exploited therapeutically. The objective of the current application is to understand the role of the microRNA (miRNA), miR-222, in pathological hypertrophy and HF. Prior work from the applicant's laboratory identified 16 cardiac miRNAs that were concordantly regulated in two distinct exercise models. Of these, miR-222, which is also increased in serum of HF patients after exercise, was necessary for exercise-induced physiological cardiac growth. While miR-222 was not sufficient to induce cardiac hypertrophy at baseline, it was sufficient to protect against adverse remodeling after ischemic injury. The role of miR-222 in pathological hypertrophy and HF remains unexplored. Based on preliminary data presented in this application, we hypothesize that miR-222 ? despite being involved in physiological hypertrophy ? paradoxically protects against pathological hypertrophy and the progression to HF. Moreover, we hypothesize that miR-222 acts as a nodal modulator of physiological versus pathological genetic programs at least in part through effects on two transcription factors: HMBOX1 and NFATc3. These central hypotheses will be tested in three integrated Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use specific and effective gain- and loss-of-function models to directly assess the role of miR-222 in pathological hypertrophy and HF. In Aim 2, a combination of expression profiling and bioinformatic analyses will be used to identify downstream targets of miR-222 and delineate the mechanisms responsible for its effects in pathological hypertrophy and HF. In Aim 3, a novel technology termed CombiGEM (Combinatorial Genetics En Masse), recently developed by our collaborator, Dr. Tim Lu of the MIT Synthetic Biology group, will be used to investigate the additive or synergistic effects of miRNAs altered in exercised hearts. In vivo studies will be supported by in vitro investigation of primary cardiomyocytes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our approach combines innovative hypotheses, technologies, and unique animal models with the complementary expertise of an outstanding team of collaborating investigators. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance our understanding of cardiac hypertrophy and HF as well as pathways with the potential to mitigate these clinically important conditions."
"9401920","Abstract: District of Columbia Department of Health PRAMS Application The District of Columbia is home to a diverse population, though health status is not equally distributed by race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic level, and sections of the city remain highly segregated (nearly 96% Black in the southeast quadrant of the city). This social and economic environment determines nearly half of our population health outcome and is reflected in maternal, infant and child health (MICH), where Black infants are almost twice as likely to be born prematurely and five times more likely to expire before their first birthday as compared to White infants. While key health outcomes such as infant mortality are captured through vital records, more comprehensive data surrounding maternal attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors are needed to understand root causes, appropriately target interventions, and institute policies to improve MICH outcomes. Current maternal behavior data are collected through specific programs (e.g. Healthy Start and Women, Infants and Children (WIC)), but only reflect small sample sizes and are not suitable for analyzing population health trends. Additional data needs identified in the DC Healthy People 2020 data development agenda and through the Title V Needs Assessment are breastfeeding persistence, unintended pregnancy, preconception health, maternal depression and intimate partner violence. PRAMS would be utilized to address these gaps in data, specifically for population-level health indicators where trend data drive policymaking and programmatic decision-making and evaluation. Surveillance systems, such as PRAMS, are the foundation of effective public health work. In order to achieve health equity, we need to understand population health status over time, convene key stakeholders to share findings, and shift the paradigm so that all sectors (e.g. transportation, environment, planning, public safety, etc.) and individuals recognize their role in and take action toward improving health for District mothers, infants and children. In achieving this, the District has implemented a Health in All Policies approach that will engage stakeholders in this way to help create collective accountability for the health of our population. Finally, PRAMS can serve as a health intervention in itself as it has the ability to connect those individuals who have experienced or are experiencing violence, depression, or other challenges to resources and support in our community."
"9404529","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Biology Training Grant (CBTG) at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center combines rigorous training in laboratory-based cancer research with interdisciplinary and translational perspectives that prepares CBTG trainees for independent (academic) research careers in cancer biology. Our trainees who do not choose an academic path are highly competitive for leadership positions in science-related careers. Now in its 40th year of NCI support, the CBTG supports 4 predoctoral and 5 postdoctoral trainees. The 35 preceptors provide research training in four areas of research that represent particular strengths at the Masonic Cancer Center: tumor biology and progression, cancer immunology, cancer genetics, and cancer therapy. The training program consists of intensive one-on-one research mentoring, didactic training in cancer biology and translational cancer research, regular CBTG-specific meetings where trainees develop critical presentation skills, obtain feedback, and establish new research collaborations. Trainees also participate in networking opportunities with prominent national and international (invited) scientists with cancer biology focus, and take part in career development activities. Historically, participation o the CBTG Director and Steering Committee members in key leadership positions associated with graduate education, career development, mentoring, and trainee recruitment at the University of Minnesota, have enhanced the CBTG applicant pool and improved the career outcomes of CBTG trainees. These efforts have also enhanced our success at recruiting individuals from under-represented groups. In the prior grant cycle we were awarded a new postdoctoral slot specifically reserved for recruitment of under-represented trainees. New initiatives during the next funding period include a new required graduate-level course elective focused on the use of quantitative methods for cancer research (bioinformatics/biostatistics) that will expose trainees to modern methods for handling large data sets and provide basic skills for understanding and mining public data bases (trainees may tailor this elective to their needs by choosing one of many course options). Upon entering the program, all trainees will be asked to complete and maintain an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Newly established postdoctoral mentoring committees will provide a sounding board for outside the lab mentoring and assist with IDP-related topics. Finally, annual program-specific retreats will include additional focused career development activities designed to meet the specific needs of pre- vs. postdoctoral trainees. With the continued support of the Masonic Cancer Center, these improvements will help ensure a robust future of the highest quality training in cancer biology at the University of Minnesota.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.        While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.       The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional  evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated."
"9324393","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exosomes are small late endosome-derived extracellular vesicles that carry bioactive protein and RNA molecules and modulate cell behavior. Recent data indicate that a wide variety of cells, including cancer cells and neurons, secrete exosomes. Furthermore, preliminary reports indicate that secreted exosomes critically contribute to several physiological processes, including invasion and motility, stem cell fate, and angiogenesis. However, the specific biological effects of exosomes on cells are poorly understood. We recently identified invasive actin-based protrusions called invadopodia as specific docking sites for exosome-containing multivesicular endosomes (MVE) and showed that exosome secretion controls invadopodia biogenesis and activity. Our further investigations have uncovered a fundamental role for exosomes in regulating the formation of additional related actin-based motility structures: adhesions, and filopodia. Exosomes appear to have a particularly potent effect on filopodia, which are adhesive actin-based protrusions that are important for directional sensing, cell polarity, cell movement, and cellular interactions. We therefore propose the central hypothesis that a key function of exosomes is to promote formation of filopodia and thereby control local cellular behaviors. We will test this hypothesis i both cancer cells and neurons because these cells exhibit robust filopodia and filopodia control key cellular behaviors. We will identify the temporal and functional relationship between exosome secretion and filopodia formation. We will identify molecular exosome cargos that control filopodia formation and maturation and determine the mechanisms by which they act. Finally, we will determine the role of exosomes in regulating complex filopodia-dependent processes, including synapse formation and directed migration both in vitro and in vivo."
"9258570","PROJECT SUMMARY: This new F30 application proposes preclinical research to examine interactions between opioid pharmacology and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIPN) produced in male and female rats by the commonly administered antineoplastic drug paclitaxel (PTX). PTX is known to cause a CIPN frequently associated with behavioral depression that cannot be fully reversed by treatment with mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. Recently, clinical studies have demonstrated an increased vulnerability to opioid abuse in patients treated with MOR agonists for chronic cancer pain, finding a high rate of abuse in this cohort. This application will test the hypothesis that PTX is able to alter MOR functioning in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) resulting in depression of behavior, reduced efficacy of MOR agonists to produce analgesia, and increased sensitivity to abuse-related effects of MOR agonists. To evaluate this hypothesis, this proposal includes novel studies to investigate a sustained, neuropathy-associated depression of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) and of increase in mechanical allodynia in male and female rats. Behavioral studies will investigate the impact of PTX on the effectiveness of acute and repeated morphine to produce analgesic and abuse-related effects. Finally, complementary neurochemical studies will examine the effect of PTX on MOR signaling using the functional assay of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTP?S binding in regions of the CNS associated with pain, analgesia, and abuse. Completion of this project will provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms of CIPN-associated depression of behavior and the behavioral and neurochemical implications of PTX-treatment for MOR functioning and opioid abuse."
"9205530","In this proposal, we address the enormous challenges common complex diseases pose for genomic analysis and the enormous opportunities surmounting them offers for advancing healthcare. The common genetic disorders proposed for study here are believed to have extreme locus heterogeneity, requiring the analysis of large numbers of samples to comprehensively identify the genomic variants underlying them. We propose that a combination of deep population studies and joint analysis of SNPs, indels, and structural variants both in coding and noncoding regions will provide the next level of understanding of common genetic disorders. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be critical to this next-generation approach to the genomics of complex disease. WGS will need to be accompanied by the technical ability to generate and handle very large data sets, a particular focus and strength of NYGC. WGS will also need to be accompanied by new statistical tools and algorithms, which will be developed by the strong core group committed to this proposal.  An overarching goal of this proposal, one that capitalizes on the power of WGS, is to identify disease- associated variants at the individual nucleotide level. In many cases pathogenic mutations fall in noncoding regions of the genome, which can only be fruitfully explored with WGS. A major effort will be put into building new computational strategies to functionally annotate noncoding transcribed sequences, and to build new datasets to enable such strategies, opening new frontiers of understanding of disease-related regulatory variants. We will explore a wide spectrum of human variation using the WGS platform, including rare variants of modest to large effect, de novo variants of large effect, and common variants of small effect. We will combine available RNA and epigenomic datasets to predict modes of action of risk and identify protective alleles. These results, combined with the integration of environmental and clinical data, will enhance our understanding of genetic risk for common disease and lay the groundwork for utilization of personal genomics in disease prevention and treatment, including the delineation of pathways for drug development.  Many of the population cohorts proposed for study are from New York, which harbors the most diverse population in the world. Analyzing diverse populations is a critical component of comprehensive common disease analysis, as effect sizes of individual alleles are believed to vary in different populations due to gene- gene interactions. Using the genetic admixture present in different populations from NY and throughout the United States, we will conduct the first systematic study of these interaction effects in many phenotypes.  These aims will be accomplished through widespread collaborations, with genomicists, physicians, and patients, organized through a focused team at NYGC. They will be enriched by the collaboration and support from independent Foundations."
"9186983","The overall objective of the Mouse Management and Pathology Core (Core B) is to raise, maintain, and provide cohorts of specific pathogen-free and genetically standardized p66Shc-/- knockout mice for all research projects in this program project. Also, the core will raise and maintain mice on calorie-restricted, low-carbohydrate and high-carbohydrate/high-fat diets and provide those mice and their tissues to the research projects in order to assess age-related metabolic consequences and clinical and anatomic pathologies. All mice analyzed will be on a congenic C57BL/6J genetic background and maintained in a mouse dedicated vivarium under barrier conditions. Core B will accomplish these objectives using relevant resources and technical expertise drawn primarily from the UC Davis Mouse Biology Program. Core B will fulfill the following two Specific Aims:    Specific Aim 1: Provide p66Shc-/- and littermate control mice at selected stages of life (cross-section analysis) in response to caloric restriction diet. p66Shc-/- and wild-type control mice will be bred, and sampled at specific intervals for biochemical and microarray analysis in Projects 1 and 2. The results of this Aim will reveal the extent to which She alters the metabolic response to sustained caloric restriction.    Specific Aim 2: Provide p66Shc-/- and littermate control mice for lifespan analysis and assess clinical and anatomic pathologies in response to high-fat/high-carbohydrate and low-carbohydrate diets. Similarly, p66Shc-/- mice resist high-fat diets and are expected to have increased lifespan in that condition, and so an investigation of lifespan-limiting pathology in that condition is important. Aim 2 will serve the hypothesis that a low-carbohydrate thus the underlying diet mimics the effects of caloric restriction and She-deficiency extends lifespan, and pathology will be investigated."
"9384915","In the intestine, regulatory T cells that express Foxp3 transcription factor (Tregs) are critical for the regulation of adaptive immune response to commensal antigens. Tregs differentiate in the thymus (tTregs) or convert from naive, peripheral Foxp3- T cells (pTregs).It is currently unclear if tTregs and pTregs have redundant or complimentary role in maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Our long term goal is to understand how the homeostatic balance in the intestine depends on pTregs and tTregs, and how their TCR repertoires can change by exposure to antibiotics. Our central hypothesis is that clonal expansions and selective trophism of tTregs are essential to sustain intestinal equilibrium. To test our hypothesis we propose two specific aims. First we will characterize TCRs on mucosal Tregs in the intestine of CNS1mut mice that lack pTregs but have normal tTregs. In addition, in these mice CD4+ T cells express semi diverse repertoire of TCRs and activated Tregs express green fluorescent protein (GFP). We hypothesize that in these mice mucosal tTregs will control intestinal naïve and effector T cells, and that TCRs expressed by tTregs can be specific to commensal antigens. Second, we will investigate how antibiotic treatment early in life can permanently change microbial flora and clonal diversity of intestinal Tregs. We hypothesize that changes in the diversity for microbial flora induced by neonatal exposure to antibiotics permanently alter repertoire of intestinal tTregs."
"9404662","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Streptococcus gordonii is a Gram-positive oral commensal bacterium. An initial colonizer of the tooth surface, S. gordonii uses an array of adhesins to adhere and promote biofilm formation. Without these adhesins the bacterium faces extinction from the oral cavity. Upon gaining access to the bloodstream the bacterium can disseminate and adhere to host tissues resulting in opportunistic infections, namely infective endocarditis. S. gordonii readily attaches to and form biofilms on abiotic and biotic surfaces using the numerous adhesins it possesses. A family of these adhesins, termed LPXTG-motif adhesins, is important for mono- and multi-species biofilm formation on surfaces. When the processing of these adhesins is blocked or individual LPXTG-adhesins are deleted, S. gordonii senses the absence of the LPXTG-adhesins and upregulates alternative adhesins to preserve adhesion ability and biofilm formation. The upregulation of alternative adhesins is dependent on an uncharacterized, membrane-embedded, two-component signal transduction system (TCS), SGO_1180-1181. Using genetic studies, the absence of the C-terminal peptide (C-pep) of processed LPXTG-adhesins was identified as a signal for the loss of the respective adhesin. It is hypothesized that the C-peps and sensor kinase of the TCS interact in the cell membrane in a ligand/receptor partnership to sense the proper placement of LPXTG adhesins on the cell surface and regulate alternative adhesins to maintain the attachment and biofilm forming capacity of the cell. The application aims to identify and characterize the molecular interaction between C-peps and SGO_1180 and the resultant signaling cascade responsible for upregulation of alternative adhesins. Complementary in vitro and in vivo studies will characterize and determine the molecular interactions between C-peps and sensor histidine kinase, SGO_1180. Studies will investigate how the presence of C-peps influences the phospho-signaling of SGO_1180 and identify the key amino acids that mediate this interaction. Parallel studies will be conducted to identify the global regulatory impact of interactions between C-peps and SGO_1180 and identify directly regulated genes of the TCS. Ultimately, the goal is to understand the mechanism by which S. gordonii regulates adhesins and prevents eradication from the oral cavity and extinction."
"9245973","Project Summary Here we propose to utilize Network Biology methods to identify transcriptomic signatures that correlate with protective responses to immunization and characterize the pathways, hubs, and key mediators associated with effective neonatal immunization. The immune system is complex and comprises 1,500 to 5,000 individual gene products, as well as epigenetic events, miRNAs, posttranslational modifications, etc. Furthermore it is well recognized that the immune system is integrated with multiple physiologic systems, and is influenced by genetics, age, nutritional status, gender, environment and underlying diseases or health. Studying individual genes, proteins, pathways and/or cell types to understand immune processes has provided us with an incomplete picture of the intricacies of the cellular processes that take place in both health and disease. Thus understanding how individuals respond to immune challenge, for example vaccination, requires a more holistic systems-level approach. We have developed a substantial collection of skill sets and tools to enable consideration of all gene expression events occurring in the blood of newborns/infants (and/or adults), and ways of bioinformatically handing these data to enable network-oriented insights while considering all factors (termed meta-data, and including demographics and differences in clinical assessments) that might act as confounding variables. In particular we will use Network Biology to understand the impact of vaccination on immune status and ultimately what factors determine the relative success of vaccination in individuals. Our Transcriptomics Service Core (SC1) will develop transcriptomic data using the next generation sequencing method of RNA-Seq. Downstream analyses will utilize our customized databases and analysis tools. InnateDB is our popular (>6 million hits) open-source database and systems biology analysis platform of all the genes, proteins, contains experimentally validated molecular interactions, and pathways in innate immune responses of humans and other species. In addition we will apply our newest tool, the NetworkAnalyst platform, which features statistical, visual and network-based approaches for meta-analysis and systems-level interpretation of transcriptomic, and proteomic data. NetworkAnalyst delivers extremely fast network layouts, hub analysis and visualization enabling unbiased examination of large transcriptomic datasets as protein-protein interaction networks. Mining of the information for subnetworks, hubs and pathways permits unique insights into data and value-added insights into differences due to experimental conditions and stimuli. Critically, we have already de-risked all procedures for this project including sample collection, transport from remote locations, RNA-Seq and downstream bioinformatic analysis and have already demonstrated our ability to develop new insights/hypotheses into the potential mechanisms driving vaccine-induced neonatal responses in our pilot studies. We anticipate that our Core will make a substantial contribution to the overall success of this project."
"9404520","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Breast cancer the 4th leading cause of death in the US. Unchecked progression of breast cancer and therapeutic resistance leads to poor patient prognosis. Recent studies have suggested that aberrant growth is not the primary mediator of aggressive cancer growth, rather, the ability of cancer cells to migrate. Furthermore, the type of migration is also important: cell cohesively migrating together have been shown to be more invasive than single cells migrating. Therefore, understanding why and how cells collectively migrate could lead to new therapeutic interventions that would better prevent breast tumor progression. Our group recently discovered a phenomenon, cellular jamming, that may explain collective migration in epithelial monolayers. Collective cellular motion could be either described as non-migratory and solid-like for a jammed state, or migratory and fluid-like for an unjammed state. The theory of cell jamming shows how cell-cell adhesion and cell cortical tension interact to control changes of cell shape and to regulate collective cellular migration. It does not, however, include contributions by cell-matrix interactions. This is a critical gap in understanding collective migration, because cell-matrix adhesion proteins are directly coupled to cell-cell adhesion proteins. This proposal will test the currently developed metrics of cellular jamming in breast tumorigenesis and furthermore, test how the addition of cell-matrix adhesions would modulate collective behavior. In Aim 1, we will test models of both normal and malignant breast epithelial monolayers and their tendency to jam (or remain unjammed) by measuring cell-cell forces, cell-matrix forces, and kinetics of cellular motion. Our group has shown that increases in cell-cell adhesion forces leads to unjamming cells. A possible mechanism of altered cell-cell adhesion is enhanced Abl signaling, which has been shown to regulate invasive cancer cell motility and differential cell-cell adhesion protein activation. Aim 2 will test the contributions of Abl kinase activity to cellular unjamming. Furthermore, as cell-cell adhesions are intrinsically coupled to cell-matrix adhesions, understanding contributions from cell-matrix adhesions in a 3D model, is critical to developing a complete physical picture of how cellular unjamming leads to collective migration. Therefore, Aim 3 will utilize spheroids of both normal and malignant breast epithelial cells as a model of cells would escape from a 3D spheroid by unjamming and spreading when modulating cell-matrix adhesions. This proposed work will elucidate the physical mechanism(s) by which breast epithelial collectives migrate, and thus could lead to a new direction in breast cancer therapy development, from targeting growth factors such as HER2 to targeting migratory factors."

"9392972","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cardiac neural crest is a unique population of cells that undergo extensive migration through the embryo and contribute to many aspects of cardiac development, including the formation of the interventricular septum, the partitioning of the cardiac outflow tract, and the development of the heart valves. Defects in cardiac neural crest are at the root of many congenital heart defects found in live births, and these issues often  require surgical repair. Despite this clear importance in human development, our understanding of cardiac neural crest biology remains incomplete.  Here we propose to determine the role of two transcription factors, MafB and Krox20, in the development of the cardiac neural crest. Interestingly, these two factors are expressed in the migrating cardiac neural crest, and not in other migrating neural crest populations, suggesting that they play specific roles in cardiac neural crest development. As transcription factors, MafB and Krox20 function to regulate expression of additional genes, and thereby they can have broad impacts on the behavior of the cardiac neural crest cells. By eliminating MafB and Krox20 function in the chick cardiac neural crest we will identify any resulting defects. We hypothesize that loss of MafB or Krox20 will result in cardiac defects that closely resemble many congenital heart defects, and thereby demonstrate the importance of these gene products for normal cardiac neural crest development.  To achieve these goals, we will examine not only cardiac morphology, but also the migratory path taken by the cardiac neural crest cells, as well as the expression of target downstream genes through candidate-based and systems-level experiments. We will also identify important transcriptional inputs into MafB and Krox20 expression. Following these experiments, we will assemble a gene regulatory network model that describes the cascade of gene expression upstream and downstream of MafB and Krox20 in the cardiac neural crest, and provides the necessary framework to determine what makes the cardiac neural crest unique from other neural crest linages. This knowledge will inform future studies in which other neural crest cells will be reprogrammed to compensate for loss of cardiac neural crest, and thereby rescue cardiac neural crest-related congenital heart defects."

"9393040","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application or a training program designed to attract and train both predoctoral and postdoctoral investigators in basic investigation of childhood diseases related to cardiovascular and pulmonary biology. The need for a training program in the cellular/molecular basis of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, especially of physician scientists interested in childhood diseases, is based upon clear evidence of a small, national pool of such individuals as faculty or trainees. Currently, few pediatric cardiology or pulmonary fellowship programs in American medical centers provide adequate training in this area of research, either at the bench or in structured clinical investigation. Our program is designed to address this need from two important perspectives: 1) To allow pediatric and other clinical fellows with an interest in basic research to develop research competence and career training; 2) To attract and train talented basic scientists to study mechanism related to childhood diseases. Our program restructuring reflects a rethinking of a training program that for 16 years successfully trained scientists and clinicians in areas of basic and clinical research. This new program has been shaped by feedback from reviewers of the previous program, by advice from our faculty and program advisors, by past trainees, and by the formation of new core programs at Washington University that allow us to expand the training experience of our trainees. In addition to continuing our strong training in developmental/cell biology and the molecular basis of disease, our new program will take advantage of institutional strengths in genetics, stem cell biology, genomics, and bioinformatics-all of which are components of the foundation of modern research. We have adopted a training curriculum for 4 postdoctoral (multiple PGY levels) and 2 predoctoral fellows with an uninterrupted 2-3 year block of full-time investigation. This is combined with an integrated and multidisciplinary set of didactic seminars, journal clubs and formal courses that are selected by the trainee in consultation with the mentor/program administrators to provide individualized education in key aspects of cardiopulmonary development and disease. Our objectives are: 1) to provide extensive mentoring to the trainee for career development and for developing independent research plans that focus on pediatric diseases; 2) to promote training in basic cell and molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics together with clinical translational research; 3) to guide the trainees' development so that, after the completion of training, successful competition for independent funding is likely."
"9186987","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The overall goal of Project 3 is to understand how p66Shc knockout (KO) and diet controls the regenerative and differentiation potentials of stem cells, and the consequences of this regulation in determination of resistance to cell stress and adiposity. This project has two specific aims: Aim 1 is to further characterize the effects of the p66Shc genotype on regenerative and differentiation potentials on stem cells of multiple compartments, e.g., epithelial, hematopoietic, mesenchymal, adipose, and muscle, already defined in substantial preliminary data of the Pelicci and Rizzuto groups. The goal is to clarify the signals and the molecular checkpoints pf the proliferative and differentiation routes, and the alterations induced by patho-physiological alterations, such as obesity and hyperglycemia, as well as to determine the cellular identity of the precursor cells responsible for regeneration, and the signals and transduction mechanisms of trans-differentiation into other cell lineages. Finally, Project 3 will determine how diet, i.e., lifespan-lengthening calone restriction, low-carbohydrate diet and high-fat diet, influence stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism of ShcKO muscle stress resistance, investigating increased regenerative/differentiation potential of stem cells and activation of autophagy pathway. The Rizzuto group has already identified enhanced stress-induced autophagy in p66Shc -/- muscles. The project's research program will determine the basis of increased stress resistance of p66Shc muscle, which could include increased regenerative capacity, decreased differentiation to adipose, and increased autophagy. To achieve this, project personnel will investigate the signaling pathways, with major emphasis on the Akt/FoxO/Bnip pathway and on signals converging on mitochondna (assembly of regulatory complexes on the mitochondnal membrane, organelle morphology, calcium transients).

"9402255","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT Specific Aims ? The aims are to use PRAMS data to compliment other vital statistics data in order to respond to emerging needs of NJ mothers and infants. PRAMS data will be essential in the evaluation of MCH programs and services, development of topic specific briefs and PRAMS Highlights in collaboration with content experts, and dissemination of PRAMS data for informed decision making, resource allocation and strategic planning. Studies and Results - The NJ PRAMS survey has been successfully conducted since 2002 averaging more than a 70% response rate for the life of the project. It has provided information that was used to shape programs and services that target improved health outcomes. During the past 5-year cycle, PRAMS data contributed to New Jersey?s first Baby?Friendly Hospital Designations, a re- allocation of resources to expand smoking cessation programs across New Jersey, and the development and implementation of a PRAMS Survey Supplement to collect data to evaluate new services. The PRAMS Highlights series, created during this period, was instrumental in communicating relevent data and information that could be used by providers and organizations poised to take more immediate action towards improvements in MCH. Significance - PRAMS data fills information gaps between vital statistics data and maternal and infant health outcomes. It is used to improve programs, services and policies for mothers and infants and is part of the national PRAMS dataset. Plans - The specific aims during the next 5-year cycle include developing new PRAMS briefs on topics such as prescription drug use during pregnancy and history of breast and ovarian cancer, evaluating safe sleep education and initiatives, and analyzing the impact of an expansion in smoking cessation programs on smoking and relapse rates in mothers. Current briefs are available at the NJ PRAMS website at: http://nj.gov/health/fhs/professional/prams.shtml. Human Subjects ? NJ PRAMS is applying for IRB modifications to the current protocol that include use of the PHASE 8 survey and web base modules. Reporting Data on Inclusion to NIH ? A plan of targeted/planned enrollment will include annual cumulative enrollment of mothers by gender, ethnicity and race. Human Subjects Education Requirement ? All Key Senior staff have received and new staff will receive appropriate human subjects education training. Publications ?NJ PRAMS data briefs and PRAMS Highlights will be developed to share PRAMS data over the next 5-year cycle. That information will be disseminated through our existing channels and posted to the NJ PRAMS website at http://nj.gov/health/fhs/professional/prams.shtml#briefs . Significant Project Changes ? A Phase 8 survey will be implemented starting in the 2016 - 2017 project period and will provide additional areas of interest for future PRAMS projects.

"9248632","PROJECT SUMMARY The main goal of this core is to establish and provide robust experimental procedures for profiling the transcriptomes and proteomes of immune cells. We will provide innovative methods for molecular profiling in bulk populations in the context of perturbations and at the single cell level for all of the proposed projects including single cell RNA-Seq and mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) for profiling single cell proteomes and signaling. Projects in the Center demand population-level RNA-Seq on a relatively large-scale and involve immune cell profiling for various tissue sites, in the context of different viral infections and perturbations, and at different time points during perturbation experiments. To address these needs, the core will provide a novel implementation of highly multiplexed RNA-Seq that allows large-scale, inexpensive expression profiling in an automated, multi-well plate format. Single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF are unique in their abilities to reveal phenotypic heterogeneity among apparently homogeneous populations of cells. These capabilities are essential for studying the dynamics of immune cells, which do not respond uniformly to perturbations and may exhibit tissue-dependent phenotypes. Combining single cell RNA-Seq and CyTOF will reveal not only the transcriptional heterogeneity underlying immune cell populations, but also protein markers and post- translational modifications of signaling molecules like phosphorylation."
"9226222","ABSTRACT RNA uridylation by terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTases) has recently emerged as the major transcriptome- shaping force in protists, fungi, plants and metazoan organisms. Pioneering work on mitochondrial enzymes from the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei introduced the first examples of TUTases? biological functions in RNA editing and small RNA biogenesis, and established their basic domain architecture and atomic details of UTP selectivity. African trypanosomes cycle between mammals and insects, and proceed through proliferating and non-proliferating stages in each host. Given the lack of transcriptional control for most protein- coding genes, the major contribution of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to these transitions is well accepted. However, current efforts chiefly concentrate on RNA binding proteins that recognize sequence elements in 3? untranslated regions and function as positive or negative modulators of mRNA stability. This proposal focuses on cytosolic 3? uridylation and seeks to assess the transcriptome-wide occurrence of mRNA U-tailing upon developmental switches, and the potential coupling between mRNA uridylation and decay. We previously identified two cytosolic TUTases, TbTUT3 and TbTUT4, and now provide preliminary data supporting TbTUT3?s involvement in mRNA 3?-5? degradation. Aim 1 will establish deep sequencing-based technology (Tail- Seq) and develop a bioinformatics pipeline for unbiased analysis of mRNA termini in laboratory-adapted monomorphic insect and bloodstream proliferative forms. The inquiry will be extended to a pleomorphic cell line capable of differentiating in vitro from the bloodstream proliferative slender form to the non-proliferative, transmission-competent stumpy form, and further into early insect form. Aim 2 will link mRNA uridylation activity to a specific TUTase and test the hypothesis that uridylated mRNAs are targeted by the 3? exosome. This work will institute a powerful tool for studying trypanosomal gene expression in development and pathogenesis, and will yield a comprehensive view of mRNA 3? modifications. By investigating early diverged eukaryotes, it will also address the evolutionary conservation of uridylation-induced RNA decay and may validate TUTases as druggable targets."

"9245977","Project Summary Newborns and young infants are at risk of infection and often respond sub-optimally to vaccines. HIPC Project 3 proposes to leverage two technological advances that will provide fundamental new insights into vaccine- induced molecular changes associated with protective immunity and may transform future neonatal vaccine development: 1) novel ?OMIC? technologies capable of measuring comprehensive molecular signatures, in particular transcriptomics and proteomics, following immunization; and 2) the development of human in vitro systems to model age-specific innate and adaptive immune responses to immunization. Our preliminary data suggest that vaccines currently given at birth, the Alum-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) and the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis named Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), induce age-dependent immune and OMIC responses, and that these distinct in vivo-induced changes can also be modeled in vitro. Accordingly, the goal of Project 3 is to characterize age-specific OMIC responses to immunization in vitro and in vivo in well- defined cohorts to deepen our understanding of vaccine-induced signatures that predict vaccine immunogenicity, including correlates of protection (CoP), and enhance future age-specific vaccine development. We will achieve this goal by pursuing the following Specific Aims: in Specific Aim 1, we will characterize vaccine-induced molecular pathways correlating with CoP in vivo employing whole blood assays in vitro; and in Specific Aim 2, we will characterize vaccine-induced molecular pathways correlating with CoP in vivo employing human microphysiologic tissue constructs in vitro HIPC Project 3 will work in synergy with the other HIPC components, including Projects-1 (OMIC integration) and -2 (Immunophenotyping) and the Data Management Core to define and validate signatures that correlate with neonatal vaccine immunogenicity. These studies will leverage novel in vitro platforms to define, characterize and dissect molecular signatures corresponding to newborn vaccine immunogenicity, thereby informing future early life vaccine development. !"

As an epidemiologic surveillance tool, it serves an important role within the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PA DOH). The PA PRAMS program is ideally positioned within the PA DOH's Bureau of Family Health (BFH) which is the administrative hub of statewide programs and services addressing the needs of mothers, infants and children. PA PRAMS data supplement existing vital records and other sources of maternal, infant and child health data used by program directors, managers and administrators to plan and evaluate programs.  The PA PRAMS program engages a mixed-mode (mail and telephone) surveying approach that adheres to the guidelines delineated within the PRAMS protocol. The primary instrument of data collection, the questionnaire, serves to capture responses across a wide range of maternal domains and variables. The population of interest is women who are Pennsylvania residents who delivered a live-born infant within the state. Through scientifically-based sampling, the survey is conducted such that the response data is representative of all statewide mothers in the population of interest.  PA PRAMS is operated as a collaborative project designed to inform services and interventions statewide, driven primarily by the findings revealed. As such, analysis priorities and plans are informed by the programs and groups impacted. It is an objective of the project to continue generating and analyzing these rich, actionable datasets of self-reported experiences, attitudes and behaviors. It remains an aim of PA PRAMS to increase visibility and recognition as an ideal source of maternal and infant health information."

"9192945","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the output cells of the retina, and RGC computation is the last processing step before visual information is sent to the brain. RGCs are among the best understood early sensory neurons in terms of their anatomy, physiology and computational properties, yet the manner in which RGCs encode visual information under natural viewing conditions is virtually unexplored. The goal of this project is to begin to bridge the gap between RGC physiology and natural function in the primate retina. Identifying the computations performed by RGCs during natural viewing will form a more complete understanding of sensory computation in the retina. Moreover, studying RGC function during natural viewing is necessary in order to restore visual function after retinal disease using prosthetic devices. It is crucial to capture as much relevant information in the visual world as possible and encode it in a way that is useful for the brain. Therefore it is essential to understand what features of the natural visual world RGCs are encoding, and how this encoding is achieved by the retina.  After many decades of investigation using simple, arti?cial visual stimuli (e.g. bars, spots, and ?ickering patterns), a great deal is known abou how RGCs process visual information over space. The spatial receptive ?eld (RF) describes the manner in which input is integrated over visual space to produce RGC responses. This project will describe how the structure of the spatial RF arises from retinal circuitry and how RF structure in?uences RGC sensitivity to features of natural retinal inputs, including ?ne spatia detail and the motion of the retinal image due to eye movements. In this training fellowship, the applicant will use electrophysiological recording techniques in an in vitro primate retinal preparation while presenting visual stimuli, including natural retinal inputs that incorporate real eye movements, to connect RF structure to RGC function in the context of natural viewing."

PRAMS is an ongoing survey, conducted by the CDC and state health departments, of mothers who recently had a live birth. PRAMS is an essential tool in maternal and child health program and policy development, monitoring, and evaluation and is a key source of information on disparities in birth outcomes and their risk factors. This third cycle of funding will allow Wisconsin PRAMS to continue and meet the objectives below and investigate Wisconsin's racial and ethnic disparities during the project period May 1, 2016 ? April 30, 2021. The objectives of Wisconsin PRAMS are as follows: (1) to understand better how behaviors, attitudes, and experiences before, during, and immediately after pregnancy relate to and influence maternal and infant outcomes; (2) to collect population-based data of high quality not found in other data sources; and (3) to translate results into information for planning and evaluating public health programs and policy. Wisconsin PRAMS conducts a survey of a random sample of mothers (stratified by race/ethnicity and geography) who have had a recent live birth. The survey asks about maternal experiences and perspectives related to their social and economic conditions, health behaviors, health conditions, and health care before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. The first funding cycle, 2006 ? 2011, was primarily focused on the design of operating procedures, research, and protocol, including the sample methodology. The second cycle, 2011 ? 2016, focused on maintaining data collection procedures and improving response rates, expanding the non-Hispanic black oversample in several counties in collaboration with the Wisconsin Partnership Program's Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families (LIHF) in order to enhance our ability to investigate disparities, and increasing dissemination of data for program planning. Results from the PRAMS survey provided compelling, stark, and unique evidence of major racial and ethnic disparities in social determinants of health, preconception health, health behaviors, pregnancy intention, stress, postpartum depression, and safe sleep practices. In this third cycle, 2016 ? 2021, WI PRAMS, in partnership with LIHF, will expand its oversample to an additional key county and to non-Hispanic whites in these key counties to increase power to detect differences by race/ethnicity and geography and to provide communities with county- specific information to drive and evaluate local-level strategic prevention efforts. WI PRAMS will also explore innovative data collection methods and means of improving response rates; pursue new and enhance existing partnerships for supplemental funding and bringing data to meaningful action; and implement a Data to Action plan that is informed by partners, tailored to intended audiences, disseminated through appropriate channels, and leads to improved health outcomes for women, infants, children, and ultimately entire families."
"9390694","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA viruses represent a third of all emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and are of continual global health concern as major causes of local epidemic and global pandemic outbreaks linked with mild to severe disease. The immune response to RNA viruses is initiated upon the recognition of non-self, viral RNA by the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology (LGP2). LGP2 function is poorly understood.  West Nile Virus (WNV), an RNA Flavivirus, is of particular interest as it represents a viral family with a large global health footprint. WNV is neurotropic and the most common arboviral disease in the United States. It causes severe neuroinvasive disease in a high frequency of infected patients. Importantly, treatment for WNV infection is limited to supportive care because vaccines or antivirals are not available. The proposed studies will use WNV-Texas, the currently US circulating strain, in vitro and in mouse models of infection to study the role of LGP2 in the immunity to infection.  These studies aim to define the role and mechanism of LGP2 modulation of RIG-I and MDA5 following Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) recognition, and functional outcomes of LGP2 modulation in viral control of the important human pathogen, WNV. My central hypothesis is that LGP2 modulates RIG-I and MDA-5 signaling through non-direct mechanisms that dictates the end result of antiviral versus pro- inflammatory signaling after PAMP detection. To test this hypothesis the following specific aims will be investigated: 1) Determine the role of LGP2 in regulating RLR signaling during RNA virus infection; and 2) determine the contributions of each RLR during WNV infection to the overall innate immune profile. In vitro signaling approaches along with ex vivo and in vivo studies will be used to examine LGP2 function and mechanism of action in regulating the other RLRs. Further, mouse knockout models of LGP2 alone or in conjunction with other RLR family members will be utilized to investigate the role of LGP2 in immunity against WNV. The overall innate immune contributions to WNV immunity from LGP2 within the context of the other RLRs will be determined and presented through a computational model synthesizing the data generated in this proposal.  Successfully defining the modulation of RLRs by LGP2 during WNV infection will have major implications in the fields of immunology, and will provide insights on innate immune regulation for possible applications in diverse fields impacted by RLR function including therapeutics, vaccinology, cancer biology, toxicology, and wound repair."

"9186980","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spores are major mechanism by which the important nosocomial pathogen Clostridium difficile transmits disease, yet little is known about how this obligate anaerobe forms the resistant spore form. While preventing spore assembly would break the destructive cycle of infection and re-infection that characterizes C. difficile infections, no therapies currently target this developmental process. A major obstacle to developing such therapies is the absence of a basic understanding of how C. difficile forms a spore. Our long-term goal is to understand how C. difficile assembles the protective proteinaceous spore coat, which is necessary for functional spore formation. We recently identified the first spore morphogenetic proteins in the Clostridia as SpoIVA and SipL and showed that they directly interact. In this application, we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which SpoIVA and SipL coordinately regulate spore formation. We will use complementary genetic, biochemical, and cytological methods to determine the functional significance of SpoIVA-SipL complex formation during spore assembly, identify new SpoIVA and/or SipL interacting partners that regulate spore assembly, and localize SpoIVA and SipL during spore formation. By interrogating the mechanism by which SpoIVA and SipL interact and recruit coat proteins to the forespore during sporulation, the proposed studies will elucidate the functions of key regulators of spore formation, identify new morphogenetic proteins in the Clostridia, and develop new imaging methods for localizing proteins in live cells under anaerobic conditions. Since SipL is found exclusively in the Clostridia, these studies will expand our limited understanding of how spore assembly is regulated in the Clostridia. Completion of the proposed work will provide the mechanistic insight necessary for rationally designing screens that can identify C. difficile sporulation inhibitors and may also identify new potential therapeutic targets. As a result, these studies may lead to novel therapeutics that can prevent disease transmission by C. difficile and other clostridial spore-forming pathogens."
"9404559","ABSTRACT Despite major breakthroughs over the past few years in our basic understanding of the cellular and molecular changes that lead to cancer, many key steps in carcinogenesis, and changes in early cancers that promote invasion and metastasis, still remain poorly defined. Rigorous training of future young investigators in cancer biology will be essential in our quest for a deeper understanding of carcinogenesis, and for the development of better methods of early cancer detection, improved diagnosis, and effective new cancer treatments.

Additional integration comes from other training faculty who are all members of the Cancer Center (many with leadership roles), and several also have leadership roles in the Graduate School. Resources from the Cancer Center, the Graduate School, and individual departments are committed to support the training program. The infrastructure of the Cancer Center is particularly important as it provides core resources available to training faculty that are therefore available to the trainees. The proposed program will include pre-doctoral training through the graduate training program in Cancer Biology, which is housed in the Graduate School, and post-doctoral training for PhDs. The total of 31 training faculty were selected based on their scientific expertise and track record of mentorship. Based on the NCIs postdoctoral/predoctoral training ratio of 3:1, this application proposes to appoint 3 new postdocs and 1 new predoctoral student in year 1, and 6 post-docs and 2 pre-doctoral students per award year for years 2-5. We will select trainees from external and internal pools based on their research and academic records and commitment to cancer research. We are committed to providing comprehensive training at all levels so as to best prepare our trainees for successful careers in biomedical science inside or outside academia."
"9199444","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by targeting the 3'-untranlated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs leading to mRNA degradation and suppression of protein synthesis. By coordinating and tuning gene expression, miRNAs play important roles in nervous system development and function. Dysregulation of miRNAs may lead to neural developmental disorders and mental illness. Here we propose to study two brain-enriched miRNAs, miR-9 and miR-139-5p, which potentially regulate the FOXP1 and FOXP2 genes. FOXP1 and FOXP2 are paralog transcription factors that function as a dimer and regulate the expression of numerous downstream genes important in neural circuit development. Mutations in the FOXP2 gene cause speech and language impairments, and both FOXP1 and FOXP2 have also been implicated in the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). An emerging hypothesis suggests that an adequate amount of functional FOXP2 is required for the proper development of the distributed neural circuitry for procedure learning and motor sequencing required for speech and language. However, regulation of the expression of FOXP1 and FOXP2 is not clear. Both the FOXP1 and FOXP2 genes have long 3'-UTRs (~4 kb), twice as long as their respective protein coding regions, suggesting that they are regulated by miRNAs. miR-9 and miR-139-5p are evolutionarily conserved and their targeting sites in the 3'-UTRs of FOXP1 and FOXP2 are also conserved, allowing us to study them in the zebra finch in the context of neural circuit development and vocal learning behavior. In the zebra finch brain, FOXP1 and FOXP2 are expressed in Area X, a nucleus in a cortical-striatal circuit required for vocal learning in juvenile zebra finches. Knockdown of FoxP2 in Area-X impairs vocal learning and reduces dendritic spine density in juvenile finches. Area X is largely composed of spiny neurons and a considerable number of new spiny neurons are generated in the germinal lining of the lateral ventricle adjacent to Area X and being recruited into Area X in young and adult zebra finches. We have shown that both miR-9 and miR-139-5p are expressed in Area X and in the ventricular zone. miR-9 is also known to regulate neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation during embryonic brain development. These collective observations led us to hypothesize that miR-9 and miR-139-5p regulate FOXP1 and FOXP2, and play important roles in regulating postnatal neurogenesis, neuronal dendritic development, and vocal learning behavior. This hypothesis will be tested using a combination of molecular, cellular, and behavioral approaches. First, we will test whether miR-9 and miR-139-5p regulate FoxP1 and FoxP2 in vitro; we will also examine how the expression of miR-139-5p and FoxP1 is regulated in the zebra finch brain during vocal development and in adults (we already studied miR-9 and FoxP2). Then we will use lentiviruses to manipulate the expression of miR-9 and miR-139-5p in Area X and test the effects on vocal learning and performance. We will also study the roles of miR-9 and miR-139-5p in regulating neurogenesis in postnatal and adult Area X, and study the roles of miR-9 and miR-139-5p in regulating dendritic structures in spiny neurons in Area X. This research promises to establish novel post-transcriptional regulatory relationships between miR-9/miR- 139-5p and FOXP1/FOXP2, and to delineate the roles of miR-9 and miR-139-5p in regulating neurogenesis and dendritic development in a neural circuit important for vocal learning behavior. As the striatum is at the center of many mental illness and neurological disorders, these results may open new opportunities to study how genetic and environmental factors contribute to these conditions via miRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks. With further research, these miRNAs may be developed into diagnostic markers or therapeutic agents."
"9406545","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastasis remains responsible for over 90% of cancer-related deaths, and can be described as a series of physical events including tumor cell detachment from the primary site, invasion into the circulation, translocation through the blood to microvessels in distant organs, and transmigration through endothelium to form secondary tumors. One of the most common sites for metastasis is bone, which confers increased morbidity, a 5-year survival rate of ~25%, and median survival of ~40 months. Upon colonization in bone, tumor cells become highly resistant to chemotherapy, and effective treatments remain elusive. Bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) constitutively express the adhesion receptor E-selectin (ES) and the chemoattractant stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which bind to ES ligands (ESLs) and CXCR4 on tumor cells, respectively. Such interactions enable the adhesion and homing of tumor cells to BMECs necessary for tumor formation in bone. Down regulation or inhibition of ES and SDF-1 on BMECs provides a potential solution to disrupt bone metastasis formation. However, direct and specific inhibition of constitutive ES and SDF-1 on BMECs by small-molecules has been elusive, and blocking antibodies induce endothelial cell (EC) activation, which can promote further metastasis. Thus, ES and SDF-1 are promising candidates for combination RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, which inhibits traditionally undruggable targets by reducing mRNA expression. The challenge of utilizing siRNA is the need for safe, effective delivery methods, as unmodified siRNA is unstable in the bloodstream, immunogenic, and does not readily cross cell membranes. In the proposed research, we will develop and implement a bone marrow (BM) endothelium-targeted polymeric nanoparticle (NP) siRNA delivery platform to disrupt bone metastasis formation in vivo. Proven endothelium-specific siRNA delivery technology developed by our lab, termed 7C1, will now be functionalized with the targeting moiety Sialyl Lewis-X (SLeX) to enable targeted siRNA delivery and silencing of a target gene in BMECs in vivo, without reducing gene expression in other endothelium (Aim 1). We will conduct a screen to determine the most potent ES and SDF-1 siRNA candidates to encapsulate in targeted 7C1 (t-7C1), verify that t-7C1 can down regulate ES and SDF-1, and determine its efficacy in reducing tumor cell adhesion and transendothelial migration in vitro (Aim II). We will then determine the optimal siRNA dosage to down regulate ES and SDF-1 on BMECs in vivo, test the central hypothesis that down regulation of ES and SDF-1 will disrupt tumor cell adhesion and tumor formation in a mouse model of bone metastasis, and determine potential side effects of our approach on normal stem cell and leukocyte homing to BM (Aim III). The proposed project targets metastasis by disrupting the physical translocation of tumor cells to bone, and presents broadly enabling siRNA delivery technologies to silence multiple genes in BMECs that contribute to a range of diseases."
"9404523","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Support is requested for continuation of the Training Program in Cancer Biology and Therapeutics (CBT) at the University of California, Irvine. Despite decades of research, cancer is the #1 killer of adults under 85. Thus, there remains a substantial need for new therapies, diagnostics and preventions that will not be met by business as usual approaches. The goal of this program is to meet this need by providing UCI graduate students and postdocs with comprehensive, highly interdisciplinary training that includes cancer biology, the most current research methods, and a focus on translational science such as the development of novel cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. The foundation we provide together with professional development activities offered will produce a cohort of well-trained experts armed to successfully attack the cancer problem from vantage points in both academia and industry. The Program benefits from outstanding institutional support from the UCI Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center), the UCI Cancer Research Institute, Graduate Division, and other campus offices. The Program provides research opportunities across the cancer continuum from etiology to therapeutics, encompassing faculty from the School of Biological Sciences, basic and clinical departments in the School of Medicine, and the department of Chemistry. There are twenty-eight training faculty, each with a cancer-focused research program and established record of training. We request support for four postdoctoral and four predoctoral trainees; one additional predoctoral position will be supported by our Graduate Division. Over the last two years, we have carried out a rigorous self-evaluation with input from trainees, faculty, and external advisors. This process has led us to implement a revised program that meets the specific needs of current UCI trainees. The Program is led by a new Director and co-Director, both mid-career faculty with outstanding records of research productivity and training. A continuing element of the Program will be a rigorous and well-defined set of courses (Cancer Biology parts A and B, Clinical Cancer for Basic Scientists, Cancer Biology Journal Club), that build knowledge about basic and clinical/translational cancer research. Other strong components that will continue are the biennial CBT program retreat and the annual symposium in basic cancer biology. A fundamental change will be greater flexibility for trainees to choose courses and activities based on their Individual Development Plan (IDP) that they will update annually. Other new elements will be a Research-in- Progress series, a quarterly seminar series featuring eminent cancer researchers from academia and industry, and enhanced opportunities for exposure to clinical cancer care and research. The Program will implement substantial improvements to recruiting approaches for both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, including innovative methods to recruit underrepresented minorities. Lastly, CBT trainees will benefit from an exciting new emphasis on professional development, supported in part by a new NIH-BEST award to UC Irvine."
"9210039","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): During the first period of funding. Project 1 focused on addressing the role of progesterone receptors in mediating the cytoprotective effects of progesterone (P4). In particular. Project 1 challenged the dogma that classical progesterone receptors (PR) are the principal mediators of P4's protective effects in the brain by suggesting that recently described membrane-associated progesterone receptors may be equally important. Major findings included the observation that indeed both the classical PR and membrane-associated progesterone receptors, particularly Pgrmcl, cooperate to regulate key cytoprotective mediators, including effectors of the ERK/MAPK pathway (such as ERK1/2 and ERK5) and BDNF. In the continuation of this project, we propose to apply this knowledge to understand whether 1) there is a finite period (i.e., therapeutic window) following steroid hormone deprivation, or with age, where P4's effects on neuroprotection and key mediators of cytoprotection are maintained, and 2) if the relative abundance of PR and Pgrmcl predict sustained protective effects of P4. Further, we will determine whether specific patterns of progesterone receptor expression predict whether P4 complements or antagonizes estrogen's protective effects. Our hypothesis states that the combined expression of the classical PR and the membrane progesterone receptor, Pgrmcl, is required to maintain responsiveness of the brain to P4. Further, we propose that the relative abundance of these two receptors will also predict whether P4 complements estrogen's protective program or whether it antagonizes estrogen's effects. These hypotheses will be tested in cellular models, where the relative levels of PR and Pgrmcl can be manipulated (pharmacologically or using molecular tools), as well as in an animal model of steroid deprivation (ovariectomy), and finally, translated to a human model of ovariectomy (i.e., the surgical menopause). While the loss of estrogen's beneficial effects with increasing post-ovariectomy duration has been described, nothing is known with respect to the response to P4. Thus, the studies proposed herein will reveal a key piece of the therapeutic window puzzle by defining which progesterone receptors are critical determinants of P4's protective effects and importantly, may offer unique insight into how the therapeutic window may be expanded (i.e., through regulation of specific progesterone receptors). Together with the studies proposed in Projects 2 and 3, we expect this program of research to advance our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the critical window of therapeutic opportunity for estrogen and progesterone, a goal that could not be achieved by Project 1 alone."
"9386929","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common interstitial lung disease and has a dismal prognosis with a median survival of 2-3 years. IPF treatments are limited as the pathogenesis is not well delineated. Alveolar myofibroblasts are implicated as major producers of fibrotic tissue in disease, yet their biology i poorly understood. Interestingly, myofibroblasts are key players in postnatal alveologenesis and subsequently decrease in number until they are essentially absent in the adult. Yet, alveolar myofibroblasts re-accumulate in human IPF and in the widely used bleomycin-induced murine model of lung fibrosis. In addition, these cells are present in human pulmonary hypertension, and hypoxia, which often complicates IPF, induces myofibroblast accumulation and pulmonary hypertension. The cellular origin(s) of pathological alveolar myofibroblasts is not well defined, and the clonal architecture of myofibroblasts in any organ and in any setting (i.e., development or disease) have not been studied. As has been critical in our studies of other processes, herein, we will use cell-specific CreER-loxP technology to identify the progenitors of pathological myofibroblasts and state-of-the-art clonal analysis to assess the clonal relationship of myofibroblasts.  Pluripotency factors induce cell dedifferentiation and reprogramming, and we propose that one such factor KLF4 plays a key role in the conversion of lung cell types to myofibroblasts in lung fibrosis. We demonstrate that KLF4 is upregulated in alveolar myofibroblasts and pericytes in the fibrotic lung of humans with IPF and mice treated with bleomycin. Remarkably, our initial studies also indicate that deletion of Klf4 in PDGFR-?+ cells completely prevents hypoxia-induced accumulation of alveolar myofibroblasts. Herein, we focus on lung fibrosis, and our main goal is to generate key insights into alveolar myofibroblast biology that can be translated into therapies for human IPF. To this end, we use genetic, clonal and histochemical analysis to study alveolar myofibroblasts in human IPF samples and mouse models of lung injury. We hypothesize KLF4 plays a crucial role in the conversion of lung cell types into alveolar myofibroblasts in lung fibrosis and test this hypothesis with two specific aims 1) determine the origin and clonal relationship of alveolar myofibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis; and 2) elucidate the role of pluripotency factor KLF4 in alveolar myofibroblast accumulation and lung fibrosis."
"9372133","Project Summary This proposal details establishment of the Upper Midwestern Center of Excellence in Vector Borne Diseases (MCE-VBD) in response to CDC RFA-CK-17-005. The MCE-VBD includes accomplished and enthusiastic partners from academic, public health, and vector control institutions in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan and Iowa. The broad and long term goal of the Center is to incentivize new and expanded interactions between experts in the region so that responses to endemic and epidemic vector borne disease are improved and accelerated. To achieve this goal, the project is focused on three major objectives: 1) Increase the opportunities for training in public health entomology (PHE) for current practitioners and students. This objective will be achieved through graduate student training in PHE and through administration of a new Certificate of PHE, with a curriculum including workshops and short courses in vector identification, surveillance and control methods, pesticide application licensure and a la carte course options to be tailored to graduate level study including VBD diagnostics, model interpretation and translation, project management, and quality control. 2) Build a community of practice including public health and mosquito control experts at the county and district/municipal level, state public health experts, and academic scientists at research institution in each state. This goal will be achieved by establishing processes for information sharing between partners, developing evidence-based and region-specific public health messages, interacting to establish best practices for VBD and outbreak management, and standardizing region-wide surveillance for invasive vectors like Aedes albopictus and I. scapularis. This work will be facilitated through a public health advisory board, and will be amply supported so that the burden of new effort does not fall to PH. 3) Research to improve surveillance and responses to VBDs. For this aim, we will develop methods to improve predictions of disease emergence and outbreaks and to optimize surveillance networks and pathogen detection. We also will evaluate current methods of control for mosquitoes and ticks and will develop new tools to reduce human risks of exposure. Data from research projects will feed back into the tools developed to train PHE, and to outreach products for use with PH partners. Successful completion of these objectives will dramatically expand the ability of public health authorities in the Upper Midwest to detect and respond to new threats as well as provide a strongly supported evidence-based practice for management of vector-borne disease."

"9245976","PROJECT 2 - SUMMARY Vaccines save millions of lives each year but the risk of infection remains high early in life. Improvement of early life immunization requires a better understanding of vaccine-induced molecular pathways that underlie protection and immunogenicity in the form of Correlates of Protection (CoP). Systems biology approaches (?OMICs?) applied to vaccinology have provided critical insights into vaccine-mediated protection, but have not yet been applied to the youngest, despite their great need for improved immunization. Immunization with Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) starting at birth is highly effective resulting in protection of > 90%. HBV is one of the few vaccines that has a well characterized and quantifiable CoP (anti-Hep B surface antigen antigen (anti-HBs) antibody levels). Importantly, while there is an established minimal protective threshold (anti-HBs > 10 mIU/ml), the absolute titer reached correlates directly with protection (the higher the titer, the higher and the more durable the protection). Such high protective efficacy, coupled with a quantifiable CoP yet significant response-variability in the neonatal and infant population makes HBV an ideal model to define mechanisms underlying successful neonatal immunization. Accordingly, our HIPC proposal, focuses on ?Systems Biology to Identify Biomarkers of Neonatal Vaccine Immunogenicity? using HBV as the model. To this end, newborns will be immunized with nothing (delayed), HBV, BCG or (HBV + BCG) and peripheral blood pre-/post-immunization collected for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to identify pathways associated with CoP. In our Project 2 (?Immune status as a predictor of neonatal vaccine immunogenicity?; PI Tobias Kollmann; Co-Lead Ryan Brinkman) we will analyze the exact same samples interrogated by OMIC approaches via detailed immune phenotyping to translate the derived OMICs signatures to host immune parameters. This will not only help to de-convolute the OMIC message, but generate the fine-granular detailed view necessary to identify biomarkers predicting a protective immune response following neonatal HBV vaccination. In Aim 1 we will determine cell composition in blood samples by high-end flow cytometry in pre- and post immunization samples from newborns and correlate with vaccine outcome. To this end we have developed a novel automated unsupervised gating platform that is the equivalent of unbiased systems biology discovery approaches but for flow cytometry. In Aim 2 we will determine the concentration of soluble immune modulators including cytokines, chemokines, and purine metabolizing enzymes in plasma pre- and post- immunization and correlate with vaccine outcome. In Aim 3 we will develop novel tools to further advance high-end immune phenotyping, and apply them to the data generated here on the newborn vaccine response to HBV. Overall our efforts will provide key insight into immunophenotypes associated with protective neonatal immunization thereby informing future development of early life vaccines."
"9248634","DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS CORE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed program is to obtain in-depth profiles of how human innate and adaptive immune cells function in response to viral pathogens in tissues and to understand how the circulating responses relate to those in tissues. Using CMV as a model of infection, we aim to identify signatures for tissue-specific control of human immune responses for promoting in situ protective immunity in vaccines and immunotherapies. These efforts will generate thousands of data files representing the results of a diverse collection of assays. The Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) will be responsible for aggregating, annotating, organizing, analyzing, and disseminating this data. In that role the Core will serve as a centralized resource to support the shared data management and analysis needs of the Center, offering access to expertise and IT infrastructure that would be impractical to replicate in the context of individual projects. Specifically, the DMAC will: Coordinate data curation, storage, and sharing: Data files will have to be accompanied by appropriate clinical and experimental annotations to support both the program?s own analysis needs as well as requirements for submission to public NIH repositories. The DMAC will coordinate the collection and curation of this information in collaboration with the relevant projects and cores and will provide access to authenticated, network- accessible storage infrastructure for securely storing and sharing data files among investigators. Provide data analysis expertise: The DMAC will provide projects with analytical expertise to guide the execution of computational investigations. Where possible analysis tasks will be automated and standardized by leveraging (and adapting, as needed) validated computational pipelines developed to support the operation of well-established shared resources at the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). The Core will further utilize and enhance novel methodologies for the analysis of single-cell data and for the systems-level delineation of the regulatory programs that preside over cell-state transitions in T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Facilitate access to high performance computing infrastructure: Through the Core investigators will have access to sophisticated IT infrastructure designed specifically to support the needs of biomedical research at the CUMC, including fast, network-accessible disk storage and a powerful computational cluster that is among the most advanced in the nation dedicated to biomedical research. Coordinate data dissemination: A key goal of the HIPC program is the timely dissemination of the data generated by all awardees to the research community. The process requires the compilation of comprehensive documentation to ensure that the data released are interpretable. The DMAC will be responsible for preparing all necessary data submissions, interfacing with repository personnel and ensuring that submission packages are fully annotated, per repository requirements."

More specifically, the goal of the Illinois PRAMS Project is to collect high-quality data on maternal and early infancy behaviors and experiences and that the data collected meet the needs of IDPH and other state and private agencies. The data collected are used to assess maternal and child health (MCH) care needs, develop programs to improve MCH, and provide feedback on the effectiveness of these programs. PRAMS surveys are sent to a sample of Illinois women delivering live births and contain questions about maternal experiences and behaviors before and after childbirth and during the children's early infancy. New mothers are initially contacted by mail with all the materials needs to complete and return the surveys. Phone interviews are used to follow up with those mothers not responding by mail. The data collected are then weighted for sample size, non- response, and other factors to produce a data set that is represented of the target population of Illinois women giving birth in Illinois to live infants. PRAMS methods have been used in Illinois and other states for several years and have been shown to produce reliable information about the target population."

"9258933","Project Summary  Dopamine (DA) has been involved in the production of locomotor behaviors throughout evolutionary time. Multiple DA populations in the brain and the spinal cord have been implicated in this process, however several DA populations remain unstudied. Here, we investigate a population of hypothalamic DA neurons that we have recently shown to be critically involved in the production of locomotor behaviors in zebrafish. These neurons are genetically defined by expression of tyrosine hydroxylase-2 (th2). We have shown that ablation of these neurons grossly reduces locomotion and that optogenetic activation increases it. However, the precise nature of the behaviors that are affected by the th2+ neurons is not well understood. To understand how these neurons modulate locomotor behavior, we must know where they send their projections, how their activity modulates those downstream targets, and the precise nature of the behaviors that result from that modulation. The first aim of the proposed work is to identify downstream targets both anatomically and functionally.. The second aim is to precisely identify locomotor patterns regulated by th2+ neurons. This will provide a detailed understanding of the output of the network. These experiments will identify previously unknown mechanisms by which hypothalamic DA neurons modulate locomotor behaviors."
"9245974","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the undeniable success of immunization, >2 million infants still die annually from infections. Birth is the most reliable point of healthcare contact and is thus an ideal time point to ensure widespread immunization. However, neonatal immunity is distinct from adult as it is attenuated after birth, such that neonatal vaccine responses are often impaired. In this context, there is an urgent need to develop new neonatal vaccines, to date a slow, risky and error-prone undertaking. To provide the molecular basis for such efforts and accelerate and de-risk future vaccine development, the NIAID/NIH has initiated the Human Immunology Project Consortium with a focus on applying unbiased, global molecular (OMIC) and immunophenotyping techniques to interrogate the human immune system and its response to challenges such as immunization. One objective of our proposal on systems biology for the identification of biomarkers of neonatal vaccine immunogenicity is to map changes in neonatal plasma and leukocyte proteomes across the first 7 days of life in response to immunization with (a) nothing ? i.e., delayed immunization to Day 7 to define ontogeny (change with age), (b) Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) for which there is a clear correlate of protection, (c) Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, known to modify HBV action, or (d) (HBV + BCG). Additional data are generated by employing novel in vitro immunization platforms employing blood from the same study participants (Project 3). The proteome basal state and landscape changes will be correlated with changes in the transcriptome (Service Core 1) and immune phenotype/status (Project 2). Integrative bioinformatic analysis in Project 1 will identify basal and vaccine-induced patterns of gene expression, protein translation, and pathways associated with successful immunization. HIPC Core/Project data will be shared/analyzed via a robust Data Management Core. To support these efforts, the Proteomics Core will pursue the following Specific Aims, using samples collected in The Gambia (Clinical Core (CC)-Site 1) and Papa New Guinea (CC-Site 2), and/or generated in the Levy Laboratory at Boston Children's Hospital (Project 3): Specific Aim1: Characterize the basal, ontogenic and vaccine-induced state of the neonatal plasma proteome across the first 7 days of life. Specific Aim2: Characterize the basal, ontogenic and vaccine-induced leukocyte proteome from the same blood sample as the plasma samples. Specific Aim3. Validate HBV-induced proteomic signatures correlating with immunogenicity using targeted LC/MS Approaches on samples from validation cohorts at CC Sites 1 and -2. Overall our Proteomics Core will provide groundbreaking insight into vaccine-induced plasma and leukocyte proteome signatures that correlate with protection thereby informing future neonatal vaccine development."
"9255171","Problem to be Solved: Capecitabine is a widely prescribed and orally available prodrug of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The principle dose-schedule limiting toxicity associated with its use is Hand-Foot syndrome (HFS), and occurs in 60-70% of patients receiving capecitabine. HFS manifests in the hands and feet of patients, and rapidly progresses to painful peeling, blistering, and bleeding that commonly require narcotics. There is no approved treatment to prevent or treat HFS, and management typically involves disruptions in capecitabine dosing regimens, which can diminish the efficacy of the drug in its approved indications. There remains a significant need to develop a treatment for HFS that would permit uninterrupted capecitabine therapy at optimal dosing regimens and improve quality of life for patients. Product and Long-Term Goal: Nanometics (d.b.a PHD Biosciences [PHD]) is developing an 0.1% uracil topical cream (UTC) to prevent HFS, which has successfully completed a Phase 1-2 clinical trial in 18 patients. Technical Innovation: Uracil is an endogenous metabolite and competitive substrate to enzymes that catabolize capecitabine to the toxic metabolites responsible for HFS. When administered topically to the hands and feet of patients as UTC, uracil is absorbed by diffusion and inhibits local cutaneous toxicity without impacting the systemic anti-cancer activity of 5-FU. Phase I SBIR Equivalent Outcomes: In a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled Phase 1-2 clinical study in metastatic breast cancer patients receiving capecitabine, the risk of >=Grade 2 HFS, a severity that is associated with pain and impairment of daily activities, was lower in the UTC treated group (44%) than the placebo group (78%). The UTC group also had a tripling of time to >=Grade 2 HFS relative to placebo (treatment group hazard ratio = 0.33, p = 0.09), and an excellent safety profile with no adverse events. Direct Phase II Objectives: Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of UTC in 25 metastatic breast cancer patients (mBC) being treated with capecitabine. Expected Outcomes: Concurrent treatment with UTC among women with mBC treated with capecitabine will delay a meaningfully detrimental increase in patient-reported pain associated with the development of HFS. Commercial Application: UTC will be commercialized as a topical treatment for capecitabine patients."
"9248633","Clinical Core: Summary The main goal of this research program is to obtain in-depth profiles of how human innate and adaptive immune cells function in response to viral pathogens in tissues and understand how the circulating responses relate to those in tissues. We will specifically investigate the innate and adaptive immune response to cytomegalovirus (CMV), as a ubiquitous persistent virus of great clinical importance in immunocompromised individuals, particularly recipients of sold organ and hematopoietic transplants, infants and the elderly. We will use two sources of human samples for the proposed studies in all projects (Projects 1, 2, 3): deceased organ donors and peripheral blood from transplant patients from the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology (CCTI) Biobank. For Service aim 1, we will obtain and process multiple lymphoid and mucosal tissues from human organ donors. We have established the necessary protocols and collaborations with Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) surgeons and LiveOnNY to obtain from research-consented organ donors, tissues that are not used for life-saving transplantation. We already have the infrastructure set up to obtain multiple lymphoid tissues (including spleen, peripheral, lung- and intestinal draining lymph nodes, tonsils and bone marrow), mucosal tissues (lungs, small and large intestinal sections) and other peripheral sites such as salivary glands from organ donors whose next-of-kin have consented for the use of tissues for research. The tissues will be processed in the laboratory and cell suspensions, and/or whole tissues will be distributed to all projects and to Core B for analysis. For service aim 2, we will obtain samples from transplant patients who develop CMV viremia through the CCTI Biobank which has a large repository of samples from 1000 recipients of solid organ (heart, kidney, liver) or hematopoietic cell transplants. There is an existing cohort of samples from 70 donors who developed CMV viremia and hundreds who did not for use as controls, with multiple timepoints and samples obtained for each donor. The CCTI biobank will provide blood samples form the existing repository and monitor all enrolled patients for the development of CMV viremia, maintain IRB protocols for obtaining samples, and will work with the clinicians to identify additional patients who develop CMV viremia and disease. This Clinical core will be responsible for coordinating all of the personnel, institutional assurance, protocols and MTAs necessary to acquire and process human tissues, and distribute samples to these projects, and will play a key role in the proposed HIPC program by providing novel samples from the diverse populations that are in New York City."
"9210040","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): During the previous funding period, we made a number of fundamental observations relative to the mechanism of action of estrogens on mitochondria that guide the aims of the present proposal. We have evidence that the bioenergetic crisis seen during normal brain aging and in AD is caused by mitochondrial structure, function and mobility dysfunctions that leads to a breakdown in synaptic integrity resulting in cognitive decline that characterizes both aging and AD. The present continuation of this grant will further assess the mechanism(s) of effects of estrogens on mitochondria and determine if these effects occur in vivo and in post-mortem samples from women. We will address 4 specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine if pharmacological antagonism or genetic reduction in the PKA/DRP1 pathway leads to a loss of synaptic integrity, mitochondrial fission and immobility, and bioenergetic decline in primary hippocamal neurons. Specific Aim 2 will determine if ovariectomy for 2, 12 or 20 weeks compromises the PKA/DRP1 pathway leading to synaptic loss and mitochondrial dysfunction and if these deficits can be restored by E2, an ER(3 agonist, DPN, or P4 treatment for 6 weeks, in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will determine if age and post-ovariectomy duration, changes the synaptoneurosome response to E2, DPN or P4. Specific Aim 4 will determine if therapy with DPN improves PKA/DRP1 pathway function, thereby ameliorating loss of synaptic integrity, mitochondrial immobility and fragmentation seen in a 5XFAD mice model. For all of the aims, we will assess DRPI phosphorylation state, a panel of pre- and post-synaptic markers, and a panel of bioenergetic measures. For aims 1 and 4, we will conduct a detailed assessment of mitochnodrial fragmentation and mobility. Successful completion of these proposed studies could lead to new understanding of estrogen targets in the brain as well as potential new therapies for age-related cognitive decline and AD."

"9396530","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rationale: Compared to Caucasians, African Americans are less likely to become registered organ donors. In addition, although first-person consent laws have been passed in 48 states, hospitals remain reluctant to harvest organs without the consent of the registered donor's family. Epidemiologic studies on African Americans have focused on the willingness to donate organs. Little research has been done on the positive decision-making process of becoming a registered organ donor. Objectives: The goal of this project is to identify facilitators associated with becoming a registered organ donor and providing familial notification. We hypothesize that positive outcome expectations (physical, social, and self-evaluative) will be associated with increased African American organ donor registration. We also hypothesize that increased perceived self-efficacy (PSE) will be associated with increased familial notification. Design and Methods: Using the Social Cognitive Theory as a guiding framework, a qualitative study involving focus groups will be performed and then validated by large-scale quantitative telephone surveys. African Americans, age 19 and older, who made a decision regarding organ donation at the Alabama Department of Motorized Vehicles within the past 3 months will be stratified into those who chose to become a registered organ donor and those who declined. The dependent variables for analysis will be 1) becoming a registered organ donor and 2) family notification of the decision to become a registered organ donor. Significance: The study will identify the key factors that drive African Americans to become registered organ donors and the determinants of familial notification. This data will inform future interventions to increase African American donor registration and develop mechanisms to ensure family consent, thereby reducing disparities in organ donation and improving the health outcomes of African Americans."
"9190383","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The heart is an endurance machine that requires a continually high level of energy supply to maintain its mechanical function throughout life. As such, the heart has the capacity to utilize multiple fuel sources to meet this energy requirement. While the adult heart preferentially consumes fatty acids (FA) over carbohydrates (e.g. glucose), myocardial fuel plasticity is essential for organismal survival. For example, during certain physiologic (e.g. exercise and fasting) and pathologic (diabetes) conditions, the heart augments its reliance on fatty acids. However, in other pathologic conditions (ischemia, heart failure), the relative use of carbohydrates (e.g. glucose) to lipids is increased. This context dependent substrate selection is governed, at least in part, at the gene regulatory level. Given the worldwide epidemic of heart disease, a thorough understanding of the basic gene-regulatory mechanisms governing cardiac fuel utilization is of critical importance. Ironically, despite being the highest energy-consuming organ of the body, and given the preferential utilization of FA over glucose, studies of endogenous transcriptional regulators of cardiac lipid metabolism in vivo are relatively scarce. Published work from our laboratory demonstrates that KLF15 is essential for the heart's ability to adapt to mechanical and pharmacologic stress. Nascent observations that form the basis of this application now identify KLF15 as a novel regulator of cardiac lipid metabolism. Specifically, cardiac KLF15 was found to be regulated by diverse physiologic and pathologic stimuli that alter fuel utilization. Hearts from Klf15-/- mice demonstrate reduced FAO rates and concordant effects on targets controlling myocardial FA utilization, transport, and ?-oxidation. Mechanistically, KLF15 was found to cooperate with PPAR? to induce a subset of target genes critical for myocardial lipid utilization. These observations provide the foundation for the central hypothesis of this application that a KLF15- PPAR? molecular module regulates cardiac lipid metabolism. To better understand the role of KLF15 in cardiac lipid metabolism, three robust and interrelated aims are proposed. In aim 1, we will elucidate the upstream physiologic signals governing cardiac KLF15 expression. In aim 2, we will determine the molecular basis and physiologic importance of the KLF15-PPARa axis in cardiac FAO. And finally, in aim 3, we will determine the role of the KLF15-PPARa axis in states of cardiometabolic stress. Collectively, these studies should clarify the role of KLF15 in cardiac metabolism and potentially provide a foundation for novel approaches to the treatment of heart disease."
"9405096","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory impairments impacting human health, with both genetic and environmental etiologies. The central mediators of hearing are mechanosensitive channels capable of transducing a sound stimulus into electrical activity of sensory neurons. Despite decades of intense investigation using vertebrate models, the identity of the mechanotransduction channel for mammalian hearing remains unknown. The use of genetically tractable invertebrate systems, such as the popular genetic model Caenorhabditis elegans, has proven to be an indispensable platform for identifying the mechanisms and machinery underlying mechanotransduction. C. elegans has a compact nervous system amenable to neural circuit analyses and a completely sequenced genome with sophisticated genetic tools available, but the ability to perceive sound in this organism hasn't been observed until now. Despite the lack of an overt specialized sound-sensing organ, I find that C. elegans is strongly responsive to sound, suggesting this organism possesses a simple auditory system. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that C. elegans can directly transduce airborne sounds over a range of frequencies. Pilot experiments indicate that sound detection in C. elegans involves transduction channels distinct from classical touch receptors, suggesting that studies of sound transduction in C. elegans have great potential to reveal a novel sound-sensitive channel, which may be conserved as the elusive channel underlying hearing in mammals. This proposal will test the hypothesis that sound is transduced by mechanosensitive channels expressed in sensory neurons that functionally couple the detection of sound with escape locomotion circuits. The objective of Aim 1 is to identify the neural circuit underlying the auditory response and characterize neuronal activity to further our understanding of how sensory input is transformed into behavioral responses. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for transducing sound. By pursuing this project, I will gain training in both classic C. elegans methods and cutting-edge functional circuit analysis, as well as in the topic of sensory neurobiology. The proposed research is significant because it provides the first experimental approach to study hearing in C. elegans and is expected to yield novel insights into the molecular nature of the mechanosensitive channels mediating hearing in humans."

"9245969","PROJECT SUMMARY Improvement of early life immunization requires a better understanding of vaccine-induced molecular pathways that underlie protective immunogenicity as Correlates of Protection (CoP). Systems vaccinology employing technologies that measure molecular changes (?OMICs?) has provided critical insights into the adult immune response to vaccination, but has yet to be applied to the youngest, despite their need for improved immunization. We will apply powerful OMIC tools to the neonatal immune response to Hepatitis B vaccination (HBV). HBV is an ideal model to define mechanisms of successful neonatal immunization because: a) HBV is highly effective (>90% protection) and has a well-characterized CoP (anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (anti-HBs)); b) anti-HBs titres directly correlate with protection, i.e. the higher anti- HBs the better and more durable protection; c) anti-HBs titers after the fist (neonatal) dose correlate with titers after the last; d) anti-HBs levels vary widely between subjects; such inter-subject variability enables powerful systems vaccinology tools to extract meaningful correlations; e) the neonatal HBV response is sensitive to co-administration of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is routinely given together with HBV in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI); this offers the unique opportunity to characterize this in vivo perturbation via OMICs. Our chosen clinical study sites in the Gambia and Papua New Guinea are amongst the world's most experienced with respect to neonatal vaccinology. Here, newborns will be immunized with nothing (delayed), HBV, BCG or (HBV + BCG) and peripheral blood pre-/post-immunization collected for transcriptomic and proteomic analysis as well as immune phenotyping. Project 1 will develop and employ cutting edge, cross-platform bioinformatics tools to identify pathways associated with CoP. Project 2, will apply unbiased immune phenotyping analysis tools to the same samples and translate to host immune parameters the in silico derived OMICs signatures. In Project 3 key molecular signals will be dissected in vitro to establish cause and effect. We have optimized all assays to work with small blood volumes and demonstrated feasibility in our pilot of rapid enrollment, stringently controlled sample collection and processing yielding cogent data that already hint at distinct vaccine-induced responses. Our cross-platform validation and correlation with CoP in a cohort containing training- and test-sets as well as a validation cohort, will identify biomarkers predicting neonatal vaccine immunogenicity i) pre-vaccination (Overall Aim 1) and ii) post-vaccination (Overall Aim 2). Delineation of the relevant mechanisms in vitro (Overall Aim 3) complements the output of this HIPC. Overall, our work will identify vaccine-induced molecular pathways key for successful vaccine-induced neonatal immune responses, thereby enhancing and accelerating vaccine development for those in greatest need."
"9372357","ABSTRACT Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) continue to emerge, with several recently spreading into the U.S., and in particular the Gulf Coast region. Following the re-emergence of dengue virus (DENV) in the 1980s, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) arrived in 2013 to cause 2 million cases of debilitating, chronic arthralgia as it spread through Latin America into the southern U.S. with local transmission in Florida and Texas. Like DENV, CHIKV is transmitted in urban settings by Aedes aegypti, but has also adapted for transmission by A. albopictus. Also in 2013, Zika virus (ZIKV) arrived in Brazil followed by rapid spread through the neotropics and into Florida. Although most infections are asymptomatic or mild, thousands of cases of fetal microcephaly have followed infection of pregnant women, along with a 20-fold rise in Guillain Barré syndrome. Finally, West Nile virus (WNV), introduced into New York in 1999, rapidly spread into the Gulf region to become endemic, with epizootics resulting in increased neuroinvasive disease in Dallas, 2012 and Houston, 2014. In addition to these mosquito-borne VBDs, novel tick-borne diseases have also been discovered in the U.S. with limited ability to diagnose and prevent human infection. Despite ample warning of the arrival of emerging VBDs, there has been little success in controlling their spread due to the difficulty in controlling the anthropophilic A. aegypti mosquito, insecticide resistance, and years of neglect for vector surveillance and control. Among the most vulnerable regions of the U.S. are major hubs of immigration from the Caribbean and Latin America such as Houston and the Rio Grande Valley (RGV), destinations for air and terrestrial immigration, respectively, of millions of persons and with a history of resultant DENV and CHIKV circulation. To improve preparedness for VBDs, we will establish the Western Gulf Center of Excellence for Vector-Borne Diseases to enhance capacity to anticipate, prevent and control VBDs. Staffed by recognized expertise in VBDs, vector biology and control, epidemiology and ecology, and with strong partnerships with public health organizations, we will: 1. Conduct applied research to develop and validate innovative and effective VBD prediction, prevention and  control needed to respond to current and future threats. Individual projects will address improved  surveillance, diagnostics and intervention, models for transmission related to weather and climate, and  insecticide resistance. Validations of new tools and methods will be performed in Houston and the RGV. 2. Train the next generation of public health entomologists capable of rapidly detecting and responding to  VBD outbreaks on the Gulf Coast and other regions of the U.S. 3. Strengthen effective collaborations among our consortium of academic scientists and public health  organizations at the federal, state, and local levels to optimize VBD surveillance, prevention, and response. The improved predictive, surveillance and control methods, training of public health entomologists, and strengthening of academic-public health partnerships will have lasting impacts on the control of VBDs."
"9191839","The Role of Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Biomechanics on Angiogenesis During tumor development, angiogenesis is upregulated to supply the ever-increasing metabolic demands of the growing tumor. Targeting tumor-associated angiogenesis has long been a therapeutic strategy for cancer patients; however, these techniques demonstrate limited effectiveness in many cancer types, in part due to our limited understanding of the biomechanical environment of the tumor. Recently, carcinoma/cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been discovered to be important regulators of the peritumoral environment responsible for secreting factors that control angiogenesis and metastasis. CAFs have been shown to upregulate alpha-smooth muscle actin and the transcription factor Snail1 and have further been shown to have increased contractile forces in 2D. We hypothesized that the CAF-generated increases in biomechanical strains enhance tip cell activation and thus drive angiogenesis in the peritumoral environment. Our lab has developed a 3D in vitro vascularized tumor tissue model that will permit the interrogation of CAF-associated biomechanical factors on angiogenesis. Preliminary data suggests that CAFs but not normal fibroblasts support blood vessel formation in fibrin gels, and that this process is not solely regulated through soluble factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, we propose studying CAF-generated biomechanics in tumor-associated angiogenesis in a 3D vascularized tissue model. Using a series of genetic manipulation techniques to elucidate mechano- regulated signaling pathways, this study will leverage the unique design of our 3D tumor tissue model to interrogate the role of CAF generated biomechanical forces on angiogenesis"
"9391819","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is based on our recent studies that IRF4 plays an essential role in sustaining cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) expansion and effector differentiation during influenza infection. In this application, we will further investigate the celular mechanisms by which IRF4 controls the quantity and quality of CTL responses during influenza infection. In addition, we hypothesize that the defective IRF4 expression in infant T cells constitutes a major barrier for the efficient development of both cellular and humoral immunity in infants following immunization. We believe that the manipulation of IRF4 expression and function may serve as a potential strategy to boost both humoral and cellular immunity in infants. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim1: To elucidate the mechanisms through which IRF4 modulates the quantity and quality of anti-viral CTL responses. Aim2: To determine the role of impaired IRF4 expression in T cells in infant immunity. Relevance statement Influenza virus is a tremendous source of morbidity and mortality for the human population, especially in infants. CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in the control of influenza virus infections and the generation of a cross-reactive CTL-based vaccine remains a viable vaccine option for the prevention/amelioration of future pandemics. However, current understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the efficient development of CD8 T cell-mediated immunity to influenza infection is still largely elusive. The successful completion of thi application thus will significant advance our understanding on the induction of effective CTL responses during primary influenza infection. Furthermore, the knowledge generated from these studies will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the defects in both cellular and humoral immunity in infants. In addition, we expect that this application will establish principles that could be utilized in the future to improve the efficacy of influenza and other pathogen vaccines in infants."
"9190402","Project Summary/Abstract: Long-distance signaling is a key feature of peripheral neurons. In the developing sympathetic nervous system, long-distance signals via the neurotrophin-receptor pair NGF-TrkA are transported in a signaling endosome (SE) from the distal axon back to the soma. Upon arrival in the soma, the SE signals for survival and, strikingly, traffics into the dendrite where it organizes post-synaptic densities. However, the trafficking mechanisms underlying SE transport into dendrites is unknown. There is thus a fundamental gap in the understanding of how trafficking and signaling of the SE are linked to create functional synaptic connections. The signaling cascades elicited by NGF-TrkA are well-understood. However, the trafficking events that it undergoes once it reaches the soma are severely understudied. The trafficking of the SE affects its signaling and vice versa. Therefore, uncovering how the SE is trafficked into dendrites using high resolution cell biological tools will move past the current barriers of mechanistically linking the physiology of signaling with the cell biology of endosome traffic and maturation. Our long-term goal is to understand how a retrograde signal is able to organize synapse formation.  The rationale motivating this proposal is that retrogradely trafficked NGF-TrkA is able to transport into dendrites and initiate the clustering of post-synaptic densities. Additionally, inhibiting the MEK/MAPK pathway exclusively in the cell body prohibits SEs from entering dendrites, indicating a significant link between trafficking and signaling. Our lab recently showed that SEs undergo a novel trafficking event, signaling transcytosis, where the SE is externalized on the soma membrane and is subsequently re-internalized. The central concept of this proposal is that SEs regulate multiple downstream outcomes (survival vs PSD clustering) by undergoing distinct, regulated endosomal conversions in order to diversify their signaling capacity. Our preliminary data suggest the specific hypotheses that dendritic SEs are long-lived and non- degradative (Aims 1 and 2), and that the inhibition of the MEK/MAPK pathway prevents NGF-TrkA?s transition into this long-lived SE that can travel to dendrites (Aim 3). I will use innovative approaches including knockin mice, microfluidic devices, and quantitative single vesicle live imaging to address three specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the identity of dendritic SEs. What trafficking proteins (Rabs) associate with dendritic SEs? Aim 2) Determine how dendritic SEs are generated. What trafficking route do SEs take to reach the dendrites? Aim 3) Determine how interference with the MEK/MAPK pathway disrupts SE trafficking into dendrites. How does TrkA signaling affect its trafficking properties in the soma? The proposed research is significant because it will uncover the mechanisms of long-distance NGF signaling for dendrite development. The mechanisms uncovered in this work will have relevance as well to other long- distance signaling cascades via other growth factors in neurodevelopment."
"9369425","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consortium between the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College Nagpur, India, affiliated with Lata Medical Research Foundation, has extensive experience in conducting international multicenter collaborative clinical trials/implementation science research dedicated to improving maternal and child health. Since 2008, the consortium has participated as a Research Unit (RU) in the Global Network (GN) for Women's and Children's Health Research and is applying to continue the productive and successful RU in Nagpur, India. The RU's goal is to continue to develop and implement GN sponsored common protocols that generate evidence and scientific knowledge to sustainably improve outcomes for women and children. The research that the MGH-Nagpur consortium proposes to develop is based on their current GN studies on the adverse effects of Household Air Pollution (HAP) on pregnancy and infant outcomes. Their GN research is focused in this area because 3 billion people (~ half of the world's population) and -80% of pregnant women in the GN still use traditional cook stoves and solid fuels that generate high levels of household pollutants, far exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) indoor air quality guidelines. WHO estimates that HAP causes 2 million deaths annually (mostly in women and children). They propose to develop a multicenter randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether pregnancy and infant outcomes can be improved by introduction of cook stoves/fuel that reduce HAP in households where pregnant women, in their first trimester, are using traditional cook stoves. The primary outcome is birth weight. Secondary outcomes are preterm birth, perinatal/neonatal mortality, childhood pneumonia/neonatal sepsis and adverse child growth/development. They also propose to measure HAP levels in women and children in a random subset of households to improve knowledge about the biological basis of the effects of HAP - including particulate matter < 2.5 micrometers, carbon monoxide and biomarkers 1-hydroxypyrene, methoxyphenol and cotinine (tobacco smoke). Successful introduction of cook stoves/fuel that reduce HAP has the potential to sustainably improve pregnancy outcomes and child health in resource limited settings."
"9381401","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary bifurcation lesions are encountered in approximately 20% of the >1.25 million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed annually. Even in the drug-eluting stent era, the complexity of these lesions and technical challenges in their treatment result in long term major adverse cardiac event, target lesion revascularization, restenosis, and stent thrombosis rates that are far greater than in non-bifurcating lesions. Further complexities arise when treating unprotected left main coronary artery bifurcating lesions, as complications may be catastrophic. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is commonly employed to guide interventional strategies following a provisional stenting (i.e., stenting of the main vessel) and, in particular, guide wire recrossing to correct for a jaild side branch. Despite the high in-plane resolution of OCT (10-20 µm), which is the only intravascular imaging modality that allows for visualization of stent struts, poor axial resolution (200 µm) prevents a complete visualization of the deployed stent and understanding of the spatial relationship with surrounding target bifurcation lesion to guide optimal interventional treatment strategies. To overcome the significant shortcoming of current techniques, we propose to develop an algorithm to visualize the complete 3D stent structure with respect to the target bifurcation lesion. Our approach will use advanced image processing and shape memory matching techniques to develop an algorithm to automatically reconstruct, at a high-resolution (~5 µm), the complete 3D deployed stent geometry by fusing OCT and micro- computed tomography (µCT) imaging data. (Aim 1). The algorithm will be validated in patient-specific coronary bifurcating lesion phantoms. To examine the utility and feasibility of the algorithm in the clinical environment, we will employ the developed reconstruction technique on clinical OCT data to assess the post-provisional stent geometry and surrounding target bifurcation lesion (Aim 2). Successful completion of the proposed research will allow for a complete and clear understanding of the deployed stent from only intravascular OCT imaging data to guide clinical treatment strategy. Furthermore, the proposed research will form the foundation for future investigations of truly patient-specific stent mechanical modeling towards development of lesion- specific stenting strategies."
"9191593","Project summary/abstract  The alternating contraction of opposing flexor and extensor muscles, known as antagonist pairs, creates the rhythmic limb movement of locomotion. This phenomenon is regulated in part by reciprocal inhibition: sensory feedback from an active muscle excites the Ia interneuron, which then inhibits that muscle's antagonist. However, when a task requires limb stiffness and joint stability, this circuit must be overridden to allow co-contraction of both flexor and extensor muscles. Previous studies have indicated that motor cortex is responsible for the reduction of reciprocal inhibition observed during voluntary co-contraction, but its mechanism of action is unknown. Elucidating how motor cortex recruits spinal circuits to permit antagonist muscle co-contraction will further our understanding of the neural control of voluntary movement.  Monkey and cat studies have reported that intracortical inhibition is reduced during voluntary co- contraction, indicating that this reduction may be necessary for co-contraction. Neural recording studies in monkey found that a discrete population of corticospinal neurons (CSNs) increases its activity during co- contraction but not during extension or flexion, indicating that increased CSN activity may be required for this behavior. Of the CSNs, a subgroup that synapses on a type of spinal interneuron known as the GABApre (CSN-GABApres) is a likely candidate for antagonist muscle control. This is supported by findings that indicate the GABApre interneuron is capable of reducing reciprocal inhibition and that the type of inhibition GABApres exert is increased during co-contraction. This evidence leads us to hypothesize that during this behavior, intracortical inhibition is decreased, the activity of CSNs, in particular CSN-GABApres, is increased, and that this activity is necessary for voluntary co-contraction.  To test these hypotheses, we will record motor cortical activity in mouse during a novel behavioral paradigm that elicits either co-contraction or alternation of the forelimb triceps-biceps antagonist muscle pair. Putative cortical interneurons will be identified by the width of their action potential waveform and CSNs will be identified by optogenetic activation of their axons. A novel tracing technique will also allow the optical identification of CSN-GABApres during recording. The importance of CSN and CSN-GABApre activity to the reduction of spinal reciprocal inhibition and thus the execution of co-contraction will be tested by optogenetic inactivation of these cells during co-contraction as compared to alternation. The findings generated by these experiments will clarify the neural mechanisms that underlie the control of antagonist muscles and voluntary movement. This information could eventually be applied to treatment for stroke and spinal cord injury patients or contribute to the development of neural prostheses for movement-impaired individuals."

"9247470","Project Summary The overall objective of the proposal is to lay the preclinical groundwork for first-in-human studies of biological pacemakers (BioP) as alternatives to electronic devices. Gene-based BioP were first described more than a decade ago; somatic gene transfer of various constructs (a dominant-negative mutant of the inward rectifier channel [Kir2.1AAA], wild-type HCN channels, and a transcription factor [Tbx18]) have all been shown to create BioP activity. However, until recently, in vivo preclinical applications have been mostly limited to highly- invasive models. We have developed a clinically-realistic minimally-invasive delivery technique and used it to create BioP in a porcine model of complete heart block. Here, we propose to use this approach to compare two ?finalist? therapeutic candidates with fundamentally different mechanisms of action. The first one is a wild-type ion channel (HCN2) that artificially induces automaticity in ventricular cardiomyocytes by functional re- engineering. The goal is not to create a faithful replica of a pacemaker cell, but rather to manipulate a single component of the membrane channel repertoire so as to induce spontaneous firing in an excitable but normally-quiescent cell. The active principle of the second therapeutic candidate, Tbx18, reprograms ventricular cardiomyocytes into sinoatrial node (SAN)-like pacemaker cells (induced SAN [iSAN] cells). No one determinant of excitability is selectively over-expressed: the entire gene expression program is altered, with resultant changes in fundamental cell physiology and morphology. The proposal utilizes the abovementioned percutaneous delivery method to refine and validate, in a large-animal model of bradycardia, the approaches required for translation to the clinic. We will characterize and compare the pacing efficacy and safety of HCN2 and Tbx18-derived BioP, testing the hypothesis that iSAN cells will provide superior chronotropic support as compared to HCN2. We will go on to perform long-term efficacy, toxicology and biodistribution studies with the more promising therapeutic candidate, and then prepare, and obtain approval of, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a first-in-human BioP trial. While the ultimate goal may be to render obsolete the electronic pacemaker, it is important to be realistic in thinking about potential first-in-human applications. Therefore, we have chosen to develop, initially, a bridge-to-device product that will temporarily provide hardware-free chronotropic support in infected patients who are pacemaker-dependent. To make BioP temporary, we deliver the genes in adenoviral vectors, relying on immunological clearance to limit bioactivity. Nevertheless, we will test catheter ablation of the BioP as a backup rescue strategy in case of persistent undesired BioP activity. This research proposal is designed to lay the groundwork for clinical testing of an optimized BioP initially in a needy population."

"9217397","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common of the acquired epilepsies and is characterized by an initial injury that eventually leads to the development of chronic seizures, during a process known as epileptogenesis. It is known that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased levels of reactive oxygen species contribute to enhanced neuronal excitability during the development of chronic seizures. However, the etiology of the metabolic dysfunction and oxidative stress are unknown. A potential unifying mechanism linking these bioenergetic and redox changes in the development of epilepsy is dysregulation of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). This proposal will investigate 1) the loss of the activity of SIRT3 and its substrates during epileptogenesis as a result of aberrant mitochondrial hyperacetylation, 2) the potential efficacy of SIRT3 activation on attenuating the development of chronic epilepsy by restoring metabolic and mitochondrial homeostasis, and 3) the effects of neuronal deletion of SIRT3 on epilepsy development and impairments in mitochondrial bioenergetics. These studies will utilize novel metabolic and neuronal techniques to assess multiple parameters of neurometabolism in epilepsy models. Further, this proposal will investigate an innovative therapy to reduce or prevent the progression of epileptogenesis. The results from the proposed studies will provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the development of chronic epilepsy and may lead to the development of new therapies to attenuate the progression of this neurodegenerative disease."
"9181426","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cytoskeletal Keratins in Epithelial Immunity to Bacterial Keratitis Corneal infection is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness in both adults and children worldwide. Since current treatments are inadequate to prevent vision loss, alternative therapeutic strategies are needed. In a study funded by a Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations grant, we explored why the corneal surface is exquisitely effective at clearing bacteria that are inoculated onto its surface. That study led us to the discovery of a novel class of antimicrobial peptides (KDAMPs), which are glycine-rich C-terminal fragments of keratin 6A, a major intermediate filament protein found in the cytoskeleton of a wide range of epithelial cells. In contrast to most known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), KDAMPs are salt-tolerant and their killing action is independent of peptide/bacterial membrane electrostatic attraction, peptide hydrophobicity and defined secondary structure, suggesting they differ from other AMPs in how they interact with bacterial membranes. Preliminary data also showed that knockdown of keratin 6A significantly increases bacterial adherence to intact mouse corneas. The overall goal of this project is to understand mechanistic and functional aspects of KDAMP generation and antimicrobial activity. The hypothesis is that endogenous proteolytic processing of cytosolic keratin 6A generates keratin-derived antimicrobial peptides (KDAMPs), that keratin filament turnover enhanced by phosphorylation of its monomers increases generation and activity of KDAMPs, that KDAMPs kill bacteria by lysing bacterial membranes, and that KDAMPs protect the cornea against bacterial adherence. This will be tested in three aims. Aim 1 will determine how KDAMPs are generated by identifying the endogenous proteases involved and the role of phosphorylation-induced keratin solubilization in regulating levels and activity of KDAMPs. Aim 2 will explore the mechanisms by which KDAMPs kill bacteria by studying their structural interactions with bacterial membranes, and by identifying their bacterial receptors on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major corneal pathogen. Aim 3 will investigate the role of KDAMPs in protecting the cornea against P. aeruginosa. This will be done by localizing KDAMPs at the ocular surface, and determining their contribution to keratin 6A-mediated inhibition of bacterial adherence and subsequent corneal susceptibility to infection. Proteasome and protease inhibitors coupled with FPLC will be used to identify the proteases that generate KDAMPs. Phosphatase inhibitors, kinase activators and bacterial antigens will be used to promote keratin solubilization. Pore formation and peptide/membrane interactions will be investigated by liposomes and solid state NMR spectroscopy. Bacterial receptors will be identified by cellular fractionation and immunoprecipitation. Western blotting, ELISA and immunostaining with custom-made antibodies will be used to detect KDAMPs. Results of this study will improve our understanding of how the healthy cornea resists infection and could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for controlling infections of the cornea and other sites."

"9239297","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  One of the fundamental steps in the formation of most organs is the assembly of cells into epithelial layers; simple epithelial cells share a common polarity, are linked by apical junctions and share a basal basement membrane. Epithelial precursors often arise in different parts of the embryo and must aggregate together, often sorting from other types of cells, to form a primordium. Cells within the primordium must then undergo changes in position or shape to create organ morphology. Some remodeling-specific behaviors of normal epithelia cells, such as the loss of adhesion, are reminiscent of cancer cells, the vast majority of which originate from epithelial cells. We want to understand how epithelial cells sort and rearrange, and are studying this in the digestive tract of the nematode C. elegans. C. elegans provides a simple genetic system for investigating basic problems of cell biology, and has had major impact on our understanding of diverse processes such as apoptosis or RNA-mediated gene inhibition. The digestive tract consists primarily of two epithelial tubes, the pharynx and the intestine; we will use the pharyngeal cells to study how precursor cells sort from other cell types, and use the intestine to study how epithelial cells rearrange during organogenesis. Although the pharyngeal precursors cells normally arise from contiguous cells, we demonstrated that they have sorting potential when mixed with other cell types. We want to study the cell biology of sorting in this model, and identify genes required for sorting. Cells at both ends of the intestinal tube undergo a rotation during morphogenesis; we believe this rotation functions to align the lumen throughout the length of the tube. We discovered that the anterior intestinal cells are guided to their new positions by an UNC-6/netrin signaling pathway. This pathway is best understood for its function in nervous system development, but several recent studies have demonstrated that it is also important for the development of non-neural tissues. We want to determine how this pathway functions to reposition the anterior cells, and to determine how cells at the posterior end rotate. Finally, we want to use the powerful genetics of C. elegans to identify genes required for both kinds of epithelial remodeling."

"9186985","In the preceding period, the program project has shown that deficiency in She proteins strongly alters metabolism, decreases adiposity and increases survival on a high-fat diet, and increases stress resistance and median longevity on a calorie-restricted (CR) diet. The metabolic shift in She-deficient mice strongly resembles that observed in CR animals, and consistently. She expression is decreased in fasting animals. Thus, She-deficiency appears to be a CR-mimetic. In both Shc-deflcient and CR mice there is increased capacity for fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, ketone body catabolism, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid catabolism, while capacity for glycolysis is decreased. She mutant mice have decreased She levels as a consequence of mutation, and CR also causes decreased levels of She proteins. She proteins may play an important role in transitioning from the fed to fasted state. In particular, the program will pursue the hypothesis that decreases in She proteins in tissues, such as skeletal muscle and liver, are needed for animals to properly adapt to dietary conditions which require a sustained increase in fatty acid oxidation (CR, low-carbohydrate diets, high-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, etc.), and it is under these conditions that the influence of Shc on lifespan is most noticeable. Thus, the aims of this project are focused on determining the influence of She proteins on the metabolic response to high-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, the role She based modifications play in the metabolic response to CR, and whether or not a diet (low-carbohydrate) that induces chronic increases in capacity for P-oxidation, ketone body metabolism and gluconeogenesis can mirror the effects of CR and decreased She levels. The three Specific Aims of this subproject are to (1) determine the mechanism for resistance to weight gain in p66Shc-/- mice on a high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet; (2) determine if low-carbohydrate the metabolic response to sustained CR is altered in p66Shc-/- mice; and (3) determine diets can mimic the metabolic changes observed in the p66Shc-/- mice and increase life span. The proposed studies will provide new information about the influence of She proteins on energy metabolism and life oxidation. span in animals consuming diets which require sustained increases in fatty acid oxidation."
"9067418","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder of movement and posture caused by an injury to the central nervous system when the brain is most rapidly developing. The causes for the injuries to the brain are numerous and the degree of severity is large. The injuries can occur prior to birth, during the birth process, or within the first few monhs of life. Whereas the central nervous system injury is non-progressive, the motor dysfunction is often progressive. It can involve one or all four extremities but most often affects the legs, making walking difficult or impossible. The level of severity depends on the extent of the injury and can be quite mild or so severe the child is dependent on others for all his/her care. There is no known cure for CP but the brain can be reprogramed. Non-damaged neurons can be recruited to replace damaged neurons and some function can be recovered. Because of the lower myelin content and elevated concentrations of trophic factors in the young brain, releasing the capacity of neuroplasticity is greatest when the child is young. Reprograming is most likely to be accomplished with repetitive, active, task- oriented rehabilitation. The proposed double arm, randomized clinical trial will enroll 110 children ages 12 to 36 months. Group 1 will receive an intense series of physical and occupation therapies 5 times each week for 12 weeks followed by the current standard of care (SOC), the same therapies once each week for 36 weeks. Group 2 will start with the SOC for the first 36 weeks and then receive the intense series for 12 weeks. Evaluations will be done at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary outcome measure is the change in scores on the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures are a change in the scores on the Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory (PEDI) after 12 weeks, a change in the GMFM-66 and PEDI scores after 36 weeks, and after 48 weeks on the assigned therapies. Regression analysis from history, physical examination data, and MRI interpretation will be used to develop a profile of children who are most likely to benefit from the intens therapeutic approach. An exploratory aim will use diffusion tensor imagining comparing changes in neuroanatomy at 36 weeks on a subset of 20 children, 10 who had been randomized to each group. Children in this subset will be ones who were born prematurely and where there was injury to the motor neurons located in the periventricular area (periventricular leukomalacia), those neurons that are responsible for walking."
"9210041","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): In the previous funding period. Project 3 discovered that the steroid hormones estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) elicit a protective mechanism in CNS neurons representing a critical component of the reestablishment of the cytosolic free calcium ion homeostasis resulting in profound neuroprotection. Specifically, E2 and P4 as part of this mechanism are capable of changing the activity of intracellular calcium channels non-genomically through distinct kinase signaling pathways that induce specific post-translational modifications. However, a critical impediment to the full development of the neuroprotective potential of these hormones as pharmacotherapies is their limited therapeutic window and systemic side-effects. In particular, the use of steroid hormones to combat disease processes affecting neurons during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is limited to a short time period after menopause in female individuals as shown by a number of seminal studies. In addition, usefulness is also extremely limited throughout the lifespan due to carcinogenic and estrogenic side-effects in male and postmenopausal female individuals. The present competitive renewal focuses on this mechanism and that improved neuronal viability is generated by steroid hormones controlling the state of specific PTMs of ICCs. Specifically, steroid hormone signaling induces these modifications and steroid hormone binding proteins functionally associated with ICCs modulate this activity. In particular, the time course and sustainability of neuroprotective PTMs will be measured for clinically relevant therapeutic windows; alternative therapeutic strategies will be determined to induce the same PTMs of ICC and thereby elicit neuroprotection. This strategy can bypass potential carcinogenic and estrogenic side-effects. This is of high significance because such effects of E2 and P4 on calcium signaling, data generated in the previous funding period, are potential clinically relevant cytoprotection strategies for age-related disorders affecting the nervous systems and neurodegenerative diseases including AD. When generated independently in clinically relevant penods, i.e. beyond the therapeutic window of steroid hormones themselves, such effects represent novel therapeutic approaches with high clinical relevance. The overall goal of the study is to identify the druggability of non-genomic actions of E2 and P4 in the CNS and of steroid hormone controlled calcium signaling proteins. This innovative strategy has a significant potential to expand the narrow therapeutic window for steroid mediated neuroprotection into an age range that is clinically relevant to achieve neuroprotection against processes underlying CNS aging and AD."
"9404565","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major immune evasion strategy of tumor cells is the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through the selective recruitment of pro-tumor immune cells and the exclusion of anti-tumor immune cells. However, the underlying cell trafficking mechanisms that govern this process are incompletely understood. Chemerin is a chemoattractant that, when expressed or presented in tumors, selectively recruits CMKLR1+ anti-tumor leukocytes in tumor tissues, resulting in decreased tumor growth rates. Our preliminary data show that B16 melanoma tumor growth is reduced in mice lacking the atypical (non-signaling) chemerin receptor CCRL2. I hypothesize that 1) CCRL2, by binding and sequestering chemerin away from tumor tissue, inhibits chemerin-dependent leukocyte recruitment into B16 tumor tissue and 2) therapeutic intervention with CCRL2-blocking antibodies should recapitulate CCRL2-deficiency and unleash chemerin-dependent anti-tumor immunity.  In Aim 1, the anti-tumor effects of CCRL2 deficiency will be evaluated in two in vivo tumorigenesis models: B16 melanoma and JC adenocarcinoma. Aim 2 is to define the in vivo mechanisms of CCRL2- dependent enhancement of tumor growth. Specifically, I will determine whether CCRL2 on stromal or hematolymphoid cells is necessary or sufficient to facilitate tumor growth. Moreover, I will test the hypothesis that CCRL2 facilitates tumor growth by sequestering chemerin, preventing the attractant from reaching or establishing a functional attractant gradient within tumor tissues. In Aim 3, I will evaluate the pre-clinical efficacy of antibody-mediated blockade of CCRL2 using in vivo tumor growth models.  I will use the established B16 melanoma model and/or JC adenocarcinoma models to assess in vivo tumor growth. In order to address the mechanistic role of hematolymphoid versus stromal cells in the CCRL2 effect, bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice will be generated by reconstituting irradiated wild type or CCRL2 KO mice with wild type or CCRL2 KO bone marrow cells. To assess whether the effect of CCRL2 deficiency on tumor growth is dependent on chemerin-mediated recruitment of CMKLR1pos cells, double KO mice (CCRL2/chemerin-double KO and CCRL2/CMKLR1 double KO) will be compared to single KO mice for their ability to support tumor growth. Finally, I will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of antagonistic antibodies against CCRL2 using in vivo tumor models.  By targeting an endogenous host-cell expressed antigen to block inhibition of anti-tumor cell recruitment, anti-CCRL2 therapy will likely synergize with or at least complement existing cancer immunotherapies, which target mechanisms of activation of hematolymphoid cells. The proposed research will provide crucial mechanistic insights and proof-of-concept data for the potential clinical applications of anti- CCRL2 therapy."
"9271492","Abstract  Based on mutational studies two decades ago, HIV-1 Integrase (IN) protein has been proposed to play a role in late stages of HIV-1 replication. These mutations, collectively referred to as Class II mutations, adversely affect multiple steps of virus replication including particle assembly, maturation and subsequent reverse transcription. Some class II mutations specifically impair particle maturation leading to the formation of aberrant viral cores in which the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) are mislocalized outside of the conical capsid core. However, for nearly 20 years it has remained enigmatic as to how IN can contribute to proper viral particle maturation.  Allosteric IN inhibitors (ALLINIs) have recently emerged as a promising new class of antiretroviral agents and select compounds are currently in clinical trials. Although ALLINIs were initially designed to block the interaction of IN with its cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75, it has recently been shown that they potently impair the late steps of HIV-1 replication. Similar to certain Class II IN mutations, these inhibitors selectively interfere with proper virus particle maturation and yield non-infectious particles with eccentrically positioned RNPs. Although it has been shown that ALLINIs can promote aberrant IN multimerization, how this event adversely results in the mislocalization of the RNPs outside the capsid core has remained unknown. Based on these observations, we have recently explored the intriguing possibility that IN may bind the viral RNA genome in mature particles and that ALLINIs may interfere with IN-RNA interactions critical for proper particle formation. To test this hypothesis, we have employed the cutting-edge CLIP-seq (crosslinking- immunoprecipitation-sequencing) methodology and complementary biochemical approaches. These studies have revealed for the first time that IN binds to specific sequences on the viral RNA genome and that certain mutations within IN and ALLINIs potently block these interactions. We propose to continue our studies in identifying the details of the mechanism by which ALLINIs affect IN-RNA interactions and how IN-RNA interactions regulate particle maturation. We also propose to use the aberrantly formed eccentric cores generated in the presence of ALLINIs/Class II mutations as a tool to understand the early post-entry events in infection. As such, this project will not only provide unprecedented insight into the novel role of HIV-1 IN in particle assembly and the primary mechanism of action of ALLINIs, but will also facilitate the development of studies to understand early post-entry events in HIV-1 replication."
"9183207","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Dr. Sanford Markowitz is recognized for making multiple landmark discoveries in the genetics of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Markowitz made the seminal discovery that mutations that inactivate TGF-? signaling are a key step in the development of most human GI cancers. Moreover, Markowitz then identified 15- Prostaglandin Dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) as: i) a novel tumor suppressor of GI cancers and ii) a key down stream effector induced by TGF-ß. Moreover, Markowitz pioneered inventing molecular tests for early detection of colon and esophagus cancers, based on detecting aberrantly methylated tumor DNA in body excretions.  We particularly base this proposal on the Markowitz team's groundbreaking work discovering the role of 15- PGDH in colon cancer. In recent studies published in Science, Science Translational Medicine, and PNAS, our laboratory has rewritten the classical pathway connecting increased PGE2 to colon cancer, discovering: i) 15- PGDH, a prostaglandin degrading enzyme is: a) a potent in vivo antagonist of COX-2, b) a potent colon cancer suppressor gene, and c) turned off in 85% of colon cancers. ii) Further, we have shown 15-PGDH functions as a key negative regulator of proliferation of tissue stem cells after tissue injury. iii) We have identified germline genetic variants of 15-PGDH, and its pathway partner PGT, that are associated with: a) an increased risk of colon cancer plus b) reduced function of 15-PGDH. iv) We have shown in many people colon 15-PGDH levels are reduced by as much as 12-fold. v) We have shown having low colon 15-PGDH confers resistance to the colon tumor prevention effects of COX enzyme inhibitors, celecoxib and aspirin, identifying the first resistance mechanism for these commonly used NSAID drugs. vi) We have developed a totally new class of compounds that can re-induce 15-PGDH in colon cancers, and shown they work via inhibiting a novel and unanticipated pathway mediating 15-PGDH protein degradation. Our vision is that 15-PGDH now provides major new opportunities for identifying individuals at high colon cancer risk, for developing new strategies for colon cancer prevention, and for developing new methods for colon cancer treatment. Goals that we propose to pursue are: i) To identify the fundamental mechanism by which the 15-PGDH pathway regulates stem like cells in the colon. ii) To identify the mechanism by which 15-PGDH level is itself regulated in the colon. iii) To utilize 15-PGDH (plus its partner genes in PGE2 metabolism) to develop powerful new tests to better identify individuals at high colon cancer risk. iv) To similarly utilize 15-PGDH (plus its partner genes in PGE2 metabolism) to develop new and powerful new tests to better identify individuals who are sensitive or resistant to NSAIDs for colon cancer chemoprevention. Furthermore, we propose to develop 15-PGDH as a therapeutic target for colon cancer prevention and for colon cancer treatment, by v) developing new strategies for up-regulating 15-PGDH mRNA expression in the colon, and vi) developing new drugs that stabilize and increase active 15-PGDH protein in the colon, and that are based on a novel compound we have discovered that blocks 15-PGDH protein turnover."
"9248631","Viral Assays Core ? SUMMARY Core B is a Viral Assay Core serving the three Projects. The overall goal of this U19 proposal is to define the cellular immune response to persistent viral infection within tissues of the host. The immune response controlling the persistence of a complex DNA virus, such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV), is poorly understood. CMV infects a multitude of different cell types in its host, resulting in a dynamic persistence marked by intermittent or persistent antigen presentation that shapes the immune response to infection in tissues where the virus persists. Preliminary data presented in this proposal defines the presence and unique functional profiles of CMV-specific T cells within tissues of infected individuals. It is critical to consider the presence of the virus in defining profiles and function of T cells, DCs, and macrophages responding to persistent infection. Aim 1 of the Viral Assay Core is to profile tissues and blood from human organ donors and blood from transplant patients the presence of viral genomes. We will also define the DC and macrophage cell types within tissues that harbor latent virus. Aim 2 of the Viral Assays Core is to provide infected cells and cell free virus for functional assays proposed in DCs and macrophages. The PI of this core has extensive expertise in CMV infection and latency in specialized primary human cell models necessary to carry out this aim. This service core will allow immune cell presence and function to be correlated to the presence of virus in specific tissues in the host. Considering the presence of virus in tissues is critical in defining the immune response to viral persistence."
"9216819","Abstract Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have so far identified more than 20 common low penetrance variants for ovarian cancer; but it is estimated that thousands more risk variants await discovery. In the post-GWAS era a complex set of challenges for the identification, functional characterization and utility of susceptibility alleles have emerged including: (i) Identifying the causal genetic variants and regulatory targets driving cancer development at risk loci; (ii) Identifying the susceptibility genes associated with risk variants; (iii) Establishing if there are common biological networks that explain the functional mechanisms underlying multiple risk loci. Clinically, identifying the genetic risk component of ovarian cancer will likely lead to improved disease prevention through population screening and disease prevention strategies; and understanding the function of risk loci may lead to the discovery of clinical biomarkers and novel targeted therapies, analogous to the paradigm of PARP therapy for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. The current proposal is designed to address many of these challenges for ovarian cancer in the post- GWAS era including: (1) Identifying additional novel, common variant susceptibility alleles for the different histological subtypes of ovarian cancer; (2) Establishing the functional mechanisms driving disease at ovarian cancer risk loci based on the identification and characterization of the likely casual SNPs and targets susceptibility genes are risk loci; (3) Using genome wide profiling of functional models based on perturbation of ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, to identify common mechanisms and biological pathways driving tumorigenesis; (4) To integrate functional datasets with genetic association datasets to improve the power of these studies to identify additional ovarian cancer susceptibility loci."
"9390170","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease remains a major public health problem and is the leading cause of death in the United States. Epidemiological data have illustrated that otherwise healthy women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are at a significantly (2-4 times) greater risk for the development of cardiovascular disease; however the mechanism(s) responsible for this association are unclear. One immerging hypothesis for this association is irreversible endothelial damage sustained during the preeclamptic pregnancy. Healthy women with a history of preeclamptic pregnancy demonstrate increased arterial stiffness and reduced endothelium- dependent vasodilation compared to women with a history of uncomplicated pregnancy, yet few, if any, human studies have sought to investigate the mechanism(s) responsible for this persistent vessel dysfunction. Rodent models of preeclampsia point to mechanistic roles for angiotensin II (ang II) and endothelin-1(ET-1) in the vessel dysfunction associated with preeclamptic pregnancy. These data suggest that changes in ang II and ET-1 signaling may lead to a pro-constrictor milieu in which attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation and reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability result in exaggerated constriction and persistent vessel dysfunction following preeclamptic pregnancy. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the mechanisms - both augmented constriction and attenuated endothelium-dependent dilation - by which ang II and ET-1 may contribute to this vessel dysfunction. We propose to utilize the human cutaneous circulation, a representative microvascular bed, to investigate microvascular signaling mechanisms in vivo in postpartum women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy and postpartum control women who have had a normal pregnancy. In specific aim 1 we hypothesize that women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy will have an attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilation response to local skin heating (physiological stimulus) and exogenous acetylcholine (pharmacological stimulus) compared to women who have had a healthy pregnancy. In specific aim 2 we hypothesize that women who have had a preeclamptic pregnancy will have a greater vasoconstrictor response to exogenous ang II and ET-1 administration. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these alterations will be mediated by decreased NO bioavailability downstream of changes in ang II sensitivity and ET-1 receptor signaling. Intradermal microdialysis for the delivery of pharmacological agents directly to the cutaneous vascular bed, coupled with laser-Doppler flux for the measurement of cutaneous blood flow, will be used to pharmacodissect the proposed cellular mechanisms contributing to microvascular dysfunction in this population. This comprehensive assessment of the mechanisms that mediate the persistent microvascular dysfunction following preeclampsia directly translates the functional and molecular findings of cell and animal studies to a clinical population and will lend insight into the management of chronic elevated CVD risk in women who have suffered a preeclamptic pregnancy."

The assay does not detect Senegalese or Ugandan Zika isolates, or dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, or chikungunya viruses. The conditions described for the PRVABC59-LAMP assay allow direct detection of virus in infected cells, mosquitos, serum and blood without reverse transcription or RNA isolation. Time to detection of a single infectious particle in blood is 60 minutes in laboratory or field settings. It offers rapid, specific, sensitive and inexpensive detection of the Zika viruses currently circulating in the western hemisphere."

"9210037","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The over-arching aim of Core B is to provide to each Project, access to tissue and results relevant to the functional status of ovariectomized rats maintained in two experiments conducted in a standardized setting. In phases I and 11, five treatment regimens [vehicle, estrogen, diarylpropionitrile (DPN), progesterone, or estrogen + progesterone], implemented after 3 different post-ovariectomy delays, will be evaluated for their ability to reverse the functional deficits associated with OVX in young adult (4-month old) and after one delay in reproductive senescent (10 month old) rats. In a subsequent experiment (phase 111), the neuroprotective efficacy of the same treatment regimens will be assessed in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of stroke. The assessment of functional outcomes at the different post-ovariectomy delays will provide the critical data that allows the individual projects to relate changes in the functions of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and intracellular calcium channels, to specific periods of sensitivity or refractoriness to hormone receptor-targeted interventions. Core B will provide standardized implementation of the experimental variables; outcome assessments, environment, and animal husbandry needed for the project experiments, and provide for highly efficient leveraging of resources used by all projects, including staff and animals. To this end. Core B will procure, identify and monitor rats used in the experiments, perform all surgical interventions (ovariectomy, implantation of Silastic pellets and tMCAO), and perform comprehensive analyses of the functional status of the rats in the context of the different treatment regimens. Core B will in addition provide non-behaviorally characterized rats that will have been ovariectomized and exposed to the 5 treatment to Project 2 for synaptoneurosomal fraction preparation, and will maintain availability of neonatal brain tissue for the generation of primary neuronal cultures."
"9222644","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  River blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis are two major neglected diseases caused by parasitic nematodes that together affect an estimated 145 million people worldwide in mostly poor, developing countries. To date, there are no vaccines for these diseases and there are no drugs that are effective against the adult stages (macrofilariae) and amenable for mass drug distribution to eliminate these diseases. The overall goal of our project is to identify macrofilaricidal lead candidates for the treatment of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. There is a critical need for safe, effective macrofilaricidal drugs for use in mass drug administration and test and treat settings to support international control programs working towards the goal of eliminating these diseases.  Recently, we identified a potent compound that is effective in killing both adult Onchocerca and Brugia worms in the nanomolar range in vitro. We hypothesize that THP will be an effective macrofilaricide in our newly developed animal models of infection and that THP will significantly decrease worm burden in both of these infections. We have already synthesized analogs that might be even more potent in our in vitro screening assays and consequently in vivo. We further propose to identify THP target(s) in adult Onchocerca and Brugia using an innovative chemical-proteomic approach referred to as thermal shift (TS) profiling. By identifying the target(s) of our chemical probes, we may elucidate novel biological pathway(s) that are essential and relevant to other nematode parasites and pathogenic organisms.  In the R33 phase, we will optimize the potency of THP and its analogs utilizing iterative cycles of chemical design and synthesis along with in vitro and in vivo evaluation. We will also use the thermal shift assay to confirm that these newly synthesized compounds are acting at the same target(s) identified in the R21 phase. Predicted targets identified from the TS assays with Brugia and Onchocerca worm lysates will be evaluated by RNAi to assess their essential functions during worm development and for survival. By the end of the R33, we will have identified 1-2 lead candidates and evaluated the drug targets in functional worm assays.  Future directions will include further refinement of the 1-2 preclinical candidates in late phase lead optimization and formulation studies, followed by animal models of lymphatic filariasis (Brugia/gerbil infection) and the cow model of onchocerciasis to validate potency and efficacy as macrofilaricides."
"9241732","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed K08 Mentored Career Development Award will help me reach my goal to become an independent physician-scientist with expertise in the role of calcium-activated chloride channels in the pathology of asthma. The pathogenesis of asthma involves chronic airway inflammation, increased mucus secretion, and hypertrophy and hyperresponsiveness of airway smooth muscle. Our lab has demonstrated that antagonism of the calcium- activated chloride channel TMEM16A relaxes airway smooth muscle (ASM) through blockade of calcium flux at both the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The current proposal will expand this research by demonstrating TMEM16A's expression, function, mechanisms and therapeutic potential in both ASM and airway epithelium. In ASM, we will demonstrate that TMEM16A is expressed on the SR membrane by co-localization with SR proteins by immunohistochemistry, investigate TMEM16A's role in blocking SR calcium flux from both the ryanodine and IP3 receptor in murine lung slices with calcium imaging, and demonstrate that acute inhalation of TMEM16A antagonists attenuates bronchoconstriction in vivo. In human airway epithelium, we will also demonstrate TMEM16A's role in mucus production by goblet cells and secretion of inflammatory cytokines by both human epithelium and ASM. We will demonstrate TMEM16A antagonism decreases MUC5AC (an important component of airway mucus) and Th2 inflammatory cytokines by qPCR and ELISA. Thus, we will demonstrate that in addition to its effectiveness as an acute bronchorelaxant, TMEM16A antagonism also has therapeutic potential as a chronic drug to decrease mucus production and Th2 inflammation. This proposal will utilize techniques such as confocal microscopy, mouse peripheral lung slices with simultaneous calcium oscillation measurements, IP3 uncaging, a novel genetic model with an inducible smooth muscle specific knock- out of TMEM16A, siRNA knockdown, in vivo flexivent analysis of airway resistance and histologic analysis. A mentoring committee composed of successful physician-scientists offer scientific expertise in each aspect of the research plan including ion channels, Th2 lung inflammation, epithelial cell mucus production and clinical asthma. A comprehensive plan of intramural and extramural coursework and training complemented by additional consultant expertise in lung histopathology, calcium imaging and statistics will expand research training and career development. The research topic is ideal for a path to independent research in areas of epithelial and immune cell biology and the central role in cell biology of TMEM16A modulation of SR/ER calcium release. This mentoring, training and opportunities for novel research directions are an ideal plan for a path to an independent research career."
"9248635","ABSTRACT Dendritic cells (DCs) are key immune sentinels that link innate immune recognition to adaptive immunity, and therefore shape the magnitude and type of T cell responses. The DC lineage includes type I interferon-producing plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and two major subsets of antigen-presenting classical DCs (cDCs). Human studies are typically restricted to in vitro-derived DCs or to DCs from peripheral blood or a single tissue. In contrast, the composition and functionality of DC populations in tissues and lymphoid organs has never been interrogated within the entire human body. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is widely distributed in the normal human population in latent form, whereas active CMV in immunodeficient subjects causes significant morbidity and mortality. The population dynamics and function of human DCs in lanetnt and active CMV infections remain poorly understood. The goal of this project is to elucidate the function of human DCs in antiviral immunity on the whole-body scale, focusing on CMV infection. We will utilize several unique human immunology resources, including tissues from recently deceased organ donors and blood samples from transplantation recipients. We will combine these resources with cutting- edge genomics and functional analysis to pursue three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the subset composition, phenotype and transcriptional signatures of DCs from multiple tissues of organ donors. In Aim 2, we will study the response of primary human DC subsets to primary CMV-infected cells, and perform comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of CMV-induced DC activation. In Aim 3, we will correlate the composition and function of tissue DCs with the presence of latent CMV infection and with CMV-specific T cell responses. In addition, the phenotype and function of DCs will be analyzed in the blood of transplantation recipients with or without the active CMV infection. Collectively, these studies would provide the first comprehensive analysis of human DC lineage and subsets on the scale of the entire body; generate a wealth of reference data on DC composition and activity; and provide insight into the role of DCs in the latent and active CMV infection."
"9248637","PROJECT 3 - PROJECT SUMMARY  Macrophages are the most abundant innate immune cells in tissues where they function as immune sentinels. They are uniquely equipped to sense and respond to microbial injury1-4 playing a key role in tissue responses to host pathogens. Emerging studies from our lab, and others, have started to reveal that, counter to earlier dogma, macrophages from different tissues are distinct in their phenotype, function and molecular architecture, and this has important implications for how different tissues respond to infections. Most of our understanding of human macrophage biology, including how macrophages react and respond to pathogens and adjuvants, is based on monocyte-derived macrophages generated in vitro in pre-defined culture conditions. It is now clear that in vitro generated macrophages are different in phenotype and function from actual tissue-resident macrophages, and thus our comprehension of human macrophages is lacking and even inaccurate in many ways. For example, we do not know which TLRs are expressed by different macrophages, which clouds our understanding of pathogen and adjuvant responses in various tissues.  Macrophages are the first targets of CMV infection, and are crucial for CMV persistence and dissemination. Since macrophages are also a key modulator of the immune response, these cells are at the crossroad between protection and viral pathogenesis. However to date, human macrophage?s response to CMV and the macrophage-specific contribution to the immune response against CMV is poorly defined. Our goal is to fill this gap in knowledge and understand how different human tissue-resident macrophages respond to pathogens, and to broadly determine the underlying programs that control human tissue macrophage biology.  Based on the emerging findings from mice and preliminary studies with human samples, we hypothesize that human macrophages are defined by their microenvironment, which results in molecularly and functionally distinct macrophage populations in different tissues, which have unique responses to pathogens, including CMV. The limited availability of healthy human tissue-resident macrophages has made it impossible to test this hypothesis in humans. To overcome this limitation, we have teamed up with the Farber lab, who has established a truly unique pipeline for obtaining primary human cells from different tissues of organ donors.  As part of the HIPC, we will isolate macrophages from different human organs and (1) define the specific properties of macrophages in lymphoid and mucosal tissues, (2) identify tissue-specific macrophage response to innate stimuli, and (3) determine the influence of CMV infection on tissue-resident macrophage function. The outcome of these studies will provide a deep characterization of human tissue-resident macrophages across and between individuals, which will also serve as an important hypothesis-generating resource for the community, help us understand the innate response of different tissues, which can aid vaccine design, and determine how a chronic CMV infection impacts the biology of tissue-resident human macrophages."
"9404538","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a renewal request for funding of the Training Program in Oncogenesis and Developmental Biology (T32 CA080621) at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Over the past 10 years, this Training Program has been preparing pre-doctoral students and post-doctoral trainees to work at the interface between cancer and developmental biology through laboratory research, formal course work and participation in seminars, journal clubs and group meetings. The hypothesis of this Training Program is that an understanding of key processes in developmental biology informs studies of oncogenesis. Trainees will use their understanding of normal development to identify lesions that are functionally significant for oncogenic transformation. The intent is to train a cohort of investigators who ultimately use this informatio for therapeutically targeting the cancer stem cell. In the first ten years of funding, the Training Program in Oncogenesis and Developmental Biology effectively trained 15 pre-doctoral students and 23 post-doctoral fellows; 14 remain in training. Of the trainees who have completed the Training Program, 9 have obtained faculty appointments, 9 have obtained relevant positions in industry, and over 25% have successfully competed for national funding. In this renewal application, we propose expansion of the Training Program to include a required career development curriculum and multi-disciplinary training in cutting edge technologies that are relevant to cancer research. We also further define the required and recommended courses in cancer and developmental biology that are specific to the trainee level. To facilitate identification and support of the highest quality of trainees, we have expanded the Northwestern University based selection and evaluation committee. We have also added an External Advisory Committee that includes individuals with involvement in high caliber T32 programs to further assist us in achieving this goal. In the current renewal application, we request funding for two pre-doctoral students and four post- doctoral fellows per year for a period of five years. This wil enable us to continue focused training in Oncogenesis and Developmental Biology."
"9404545","Abstract This competing renewal application requests a second five-year support by the Ruth Kirschstein National Research Service Award (T32) for our ?Cancer Biology Training Program? based at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The goal of the Cancer Biology Training Program is to educate and train the next generation of cancer researchers (pre- and postdoctoral trainees) to meet the growing demands for scientists trained in multiple facets of cancer biology. Since the start of the T32 award in August 2011, all trainee positions (1 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral) have continuously been filled. As a result, to date four predoctoral students and seven postdoctoral fellows have been appointed as T32 trainees including three from populations that are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. Going forward, we request funds to support the same number of predoctoral (1) and postdoctoral (3) trainees. Trainees will be selected for their academic achievements and their dedication to cancer research. The training program has 28 faculty mentors (19 full professors, 6 associate professors, and 3 assistant professors; 22 men and 6 women) from 8 departments who have full faculty privileges in the Graduate School as well as in the NCI-designated Cancer Center, the Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC), and with diverse expertise that provides depth and breadth of research opportunities for trainees. The mentors, who share several collaborative projects and are very interactive, have a strong record of funded research (average direct costs >$500K per mentor in the current year) as well as in mentoring predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows. The Training Program includes predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees who are appointed for a period of two to three years. The training curriculum (including two cancer biology core courses, a cancer biology journal club, and a drug development lecture series) stresses both basic and translational approaches to provide outstanding training for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees in broad range of contemporary topics in cancer biology and to give them a solid background in oncology necessary for their success in research both near- term and long-term. The curriculum, which has recently been revitalized with introduction of new didactics in bioinformatics, also emphasizes training in scientific communication with opportunities to improve both oral and written skills. The training program leverages the growing basic and clinical research opportunities on campus and active seminar series, especially at CTRC ? the only NCI-designated Cancer Center in South Texas, and strong across-the-board institutional support from the PI's department chair to the university president. This sole NCI-funded T32 Training Program at our institution is uniquely poised to train a diverse cadre of upcoming cancer researchers because a large number of underrepresented minority (URM) trainees are attracted to our program making this a unique opportunity to enrich the diversity in the pool of future independent investigators working in cancer research."
"9205498","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heterotrimeric G proteins (???) are well known for their function in linking G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs) to intracellular responses, and thereby playing essential roles in transmitting a wide variety of extracellular signals into regulation of countless physiological process. G proteins function as molecular switches whereby a GPCR promotes GDP release from the ? subunit (G?), followed by subsequent binding of GTP by G? and dissociation of G? and G??. G?-GTP and G?? can then regulate a variety of signaling proteins until the GTP hydrolysis activity of G? turns off signaling by generating the inactive G?-GDP, which then re- associates with G?? to complete the cycle of activation and inactivation. However, in uveal melanoma this tightly controlled G protein cycle is corrupted by a mutation in the closely related G?, ?q or ?1. Such mutations, occurring in over 90% of uveal melanoma, generate a constitutively active ?q or ?11 in which GTP hydrolysis activity is abrogated, thereby locking the G? in an active GTP bound state and turning ?q or ?11 into an oncogenic driver of this cancer. Uveal melanoma, the most common cancer of the eye in adults, metastasizes in up to 50% of uveal melanoma patients, and, once metastasis occurs, it is invariably fatal with an average survival of less than six months. There are currently no effective therapies for metastatic uveal melanoma, and thus there exists an urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that promote the development of uveal melanoma. Based on numerous basic research studies on G protein function, it is clear that mutationally activated G? exhibit key cell biology properties, such as changes in subcellular localization, trafficking, lipid modification, degradation and activation of unique signaling pathways, that set them apart from the wild type G? counterpart. In uveal melanoma, it has been difficult to compare mutationally activated ?q or ?11 with wild type ?q or ?11 due to a lack of tools to differentiate between and effectively study the endogenous mutant versus wild type protein. Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop such a tool by using gene-editing approaches with uveal melanoma cell lines to generate cells in which the endogenous ?q or ?11, either the wild type or mutationally activated form, is fused in-frame to GFP. These genome-edited uveal melanoma cell lines will be a novel and much-needed tool to better understand how mutationally activated ?q or ?11 functions in uveal melanoma and to identify key aspects of regulation of mutationally activated ?q or ?11 that differ from that of wld type ?q or ?11."
"9245971","PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the proposed Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) is to characterize vaccine-induced biological variations (transcriptomic/proteomic; summarized as ?OMIC?) in the human newborn that correlate with downstream immunogenicity as predictors for Correlates of Protection (CoPs). The Data Management Core (DMC) will establish and maintain a cloud-based discovery environment, consisting of data storage and computational tools to perform integrative systems analyses and facilitate collaborations between the HIPC Projects and Cores. The DMC will also facilitate data sharing, submission to public repositories, and HIPC engagement with the external research community. The broad goals of the DMC are reliable data capture and retention; ongoing quality assurance; and provision of access/computational resources for integrative analyses. We articulate these goals through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Create a secure data management infrastructure for data acquisition and retention from HIPC Clinical Core Sites, Service Cores, and Projects. Aim 2: Establish HIPC-wide quality assurance processes and accepted standards for each of the heterogeneous data sources. Aim 3: Provide biostatistical and bioinformatics tools and expertise to lead integrative analyses across platforms. Our data management architecture will rely on new capabilities at our institution to access Amazon Web Services (AWS) for reliable cloud-based research support. We have worked closely with our Research Computing department to implement a system for HIPC collaborators that will combine security and reliability with ease of access and the most advanced computational tools and resources available. We believe our approach will offer many advantages over a more traditional server-based architecture, not the least of which is a more fruitful computing environment for integrative analyses and scientific discovery. Scientific endeavors of this scope/scale require robust data management plans, infrastructure, and operations. Practical data integration requires an environment within which these data can be linked across platforms. The DMC?s function will build on close integration of project/core leads into the DMC (eg, Drs. Steen, Tebbutt, Brinkman, Foster and Hancock) thereby synergistically leveraging their distinct strengths and augmenting the the productivity and impact of our proposed program. Completion of our Specific Aims will enable fresh insights into the biological basis underlying vaccine protective responses in early life, informing rational design of effective vaccines for the very young who are at highest risk from infections."

Core Surveillance Surveillance Project Summary The Tennessee (TN) Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is a collaborative project with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) to monitor state-specific population-based maternal attitudes, behaviors and experiences within the state of Tennessee. While TN PRAMS has participated in these surveillance efforts for more than eight years, additional efforts have been identified that will improve response rates and the dissemination of data. Five-year Goals and Objectives In the next five years, TN PRAMS will continue monitoring maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy that may influence birth outcomes. Additionally, we will concentrate on improving response rates by: (1) increasing awareness of surveillance activities throughout the state, particularly in the urban/rural areas identified as experiencing high rates of poor maternal health outcomes, and (2) expanding the dissemination of PRAMS data by partnering with key stakeholders to identify those in need of surveillance data to support their public health intervention efforts. Resources The TN PRAMS Project is a combined effort among the Division of Policy, Planning, and Assessment?s Offices of Surveillance, Epidemiology & Evaluation (SEE), Vital Records (VR), and Healthcare Statistics (HS); TDH?s Division of Family Health and Wellness (FHW), and the CDC. VR provides samples from electronic birth certificates, FHW provides expertise in the area of mothers and infants under study, and SEE provides staff and resources for implementation, data analysis and dissemination. TN PRAMS is staffed by two full time positions: a program coordinator (1/2 grant and state funded) and a data manager (1/2 grant and state funded). The Director of SEE, a MCH epidemiologist, provides leadership as the Principal Investigator. The Director of FHW, a physician, directs the Title V MCH Block Grant than plays a key role in the provision of maternal and child health services in Tennessee. All offices work together in one collaborative effort to fulfill the TN PRAMS grant goals. Analysis Plan, Evaluation & Dissemination Over the next five years, TN PRAMS will generate reports and fact sheets for publication on the TDH website. Additionally, TN PRAMS will support FHW?s ongoing efforts to improve maternal health behaviors, such as the state safe sleep initiative (Welcome Baby). TN PRAMS provides prevalence estimates and trends of TN babies? sleeping positions, mothers? behaviors and knowledge of suitable sleeping behaviors. Evaluation is conducted throughout the lifetime of the project as set forth by the PRAMS model supplied by the CDC. To date, TDH has successfully completed and submitted eight full years of data (2007 to 2014). The ninth year of data collection is currently in process."
"9362873","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research represents an interdisciplinary effort to understand the pathways for the biosynthesis and metabolism of the fatty acid amide family of bioactive lipids, with a particular focus on a novel set of N-acyltransferases. The N-acyltransferases catalyze the following reaction: acyl-CoA + amine -> N-acylamine + CoA-SH. We have largely completed an evaluation of the endogenous fatty acid amidome in neuroblastoma cells and in Drosophila and need to complete our measurements of fatty acid amidome in choroid plexus cells. Once the baseline fatty acid amide lipidome is understood in these model systems, we will eliminate specific enzymes of fatty acid amide metabolism and measure the corresponding changes fatty acid amides - subtraction lipidomics. More detailed information will come from competitive pulse chase experiments. Over the past 20 years, it has become increasingly clear that the fatty acid amides are a broad family of cell-signaling lipids tremendously important to human health. The members of the fatty acid amide family include the N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), the N-acyldopamines (NADAs), the N-acyltaurines (NATs), N-acylamino acids (NAMAs), and the primary fatty acid amides (PFAMs). Recent studies have suggested that members of the fatty acid amide family are metabolically linked. Our goal is to better define the metabolic relationships between the members of the fatty acid amide family and elaborate the enzymes catalyzing these conversions. A full understanding of fatty acid amide metabolism and the enzymes involved is essential to ultimately developing new drugs and diagnostic strategies to treat human diseases related to fatty acid amide dysfunction."
"9248636","Project Summary ? Project 1 T cell responses to viruses are initiated, function and maintained in diverse tissues sites; however, our knowledge of human anti-viral T cells is largely derived from the sampling of peripheral blood, containing only 2-3% of the total T cell complement. Studies in mouse models have revealed the importance of tissue- localized T cell responses in viral clearance and long-term maintenance of protective immunity in the form of a subset of non-circulating, tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells. The discovery of TRM raises the critical question of how the circulating T cell response is related to that in tissues. My laboratory has set up a novel tissue resource and protocol with the organ procurement organization for New York City to obtain multiple lymphoid and mucosal tissues from individual organ donors, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study immune cells and responses in tissues and circulation. In five years of this protocol, we have optimized the acquisition and isolation of cells from tissues of 250 donors representing all ages of life, and have discovered novel aspects of how human T cells differentiate, become compartmentalized and function in tissues and circulation at different life stages. These tissues also provide a new opportunity to study ongoing anti-viral T cell responses in situ, as their serological profile for the prevalent persisting herpesviruses is known, including human CMV (hCMV; 60% donors) which infects multiple tissues and establishes lifelong latency. Human CMV requires active T cell responses to be controlled?a significant frequency of blood CD8 T cells (5- 30%) are CMV-specific in seropositive individuals, and immunosuppression due to transplantation, cancer or HIV infection can trigger CMV reactivation leading to virus dissemination, end organ failure and death. We propose a novel investigation of CMV-specific T cell responses in circulation and diverse tissues of individual donors to understand on a fundamental level how tissue location impacts anti-viral T cell responses to CMV, and as a ?model system? for assessing tissue-mediated control of anti-viral immunity. Our central hypothesis is that the functionality of T cells specific for CMV in healthy humans will vary depending on tissue site which will be further impacted by virus persistence and age. In the proposed project, we will profile CMV-specific T cell responses from diverse human lymphoid, mucosal and endocrine tissues sites obtained through the Clinical Core, together with blood samples from transplant patients who developed CMV viremia for understand how tissue impacts the T cell response, define tissue-specific signatures for T cell responses and identify whether peripheral blood T cell responses during active infection will contain traces of their tissue of origin. We will profile using whole transcriptome profiling on the population and single cell level by Core A, high dimensional analysis of protein expression by CyTOF also through Core A, with all data curated and analyzed through the data management and analysis (DMAC) core. Results from this study will elucidate tissue signatures of T cell- mediated responses and a new understanding of how circulating responses represent those in tissues."
"9254772","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with 19,000 new cases annually in the US. A deoxycytidine nucleoside analog Cytarabine (AraC) is the principal chemotherapeutic agent used in AML. AraC-containing chemotherapeutic regimens induce complete remission in 65?80% of newly diagnosed AML patients, but a substantial minority of leukemias is intrinsically resistant to AraC. Furthermore, most of the initially responding patients relapse with resistant disease and poor response to subsequent therapies. As a result, the current overall survival rate for adult AML patients is less than 30%. The known mechanisms of AraC resistance involve changes in gene expression, at least some of which can be induced epigenetically by treatment with AraC or other chemotherapeutic drugs. A major cause of clinical resistance in AML is the presence of the leukemic stem cell population, resistant to conventional therapies. Novel therapies with the abilities to prevent the emergence of drug resistance or to target the leukemic stem cells are needed to improve patient outcomes. This application proposes a potentially transformative approach to leukemia therapy based on combining AraC with a novel class of preclinical agents that target transcription-regulating kinase CDK8 and its paralog CDK19. CDK8/19 inhibitors are characterized by a lack of toxicity, chemopotentiating activity, the ability to prevent transcriptional changes leading to drug resistance, inhibition of stem cell differentiation and proliferation and direct suppression of a subset of leukemias. We have found that the addition of CDK8/19 inhibitors to AraC drastically improves its long-term efficacy in human AML cell lines that do not respond to CDK8/19 inhibitors alone and inhibits the development of AraC resistance. A combination of CDK8/19 inhibitors with AraC also shows efficacy against AML lines with either acquired or intrinsic AraC resistance. Senex Biotechnology has developed a highly selective inhibitor of CDK8/19, Senexin B, and we now propose a program aimed at developing Senexin B/AraC combinations for AML therapy. In Phase I of this program, we will investigate the long-term in vitro efficacy of Senexin B/AraC combinations against a panel of human AML cell lines and determine if the synergistic effect is associated with the impact of CDK8/19 inhibition on the stem cell-like subpopulation of leukemic cells. To establish the conditions for efficient and sustained suppression of AML growth in vivo by Senexin B/AraC combination, we will first carry out pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies of Senexin B combined with AraC in immunodeficient mice. We will then test the efficacy of Senexin B alone in a mouse xenograft model of a Senexin B-sensitive human leukemia and of Senexin B/AraC combination in both Senexin B-sensitive and Senexin B-resistant mouse xenograft AML models. In the future Phase II, we will extend our studies to patient-derived leukemia samples and generate an IND package to initiate clinical studies of a CDK8/19 inhibitor/AraC combination for AML therapy."
"9236004","Project Summary: Despite advances in chemoradiation therapy, the five-year survival rate for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN) remains a dismal 15% due to diagnosis at a late, incurable stage. Endoscopic screening is typically performed in high-risk populations with Lugol?s iodine staining of the mucosa and targeted biopsy of abnormal (unstained) areas. While Lugol?s significantly increases the sensitivity of white light endoscopy (>95%), specificity remains poor (<65%) as inflammation and other benign mucosal changes mimic neoplasia. While confocal microendoscopy has been shown to dramatically enhance the diagnostic accuracy and yield of Lugol?s chromoendoscopy, existing platforms are costly (>$150,000) and only available in a handful of tertiary centers worldwide. In an ongoing RO1 (2014-2019) of 1300 subjects in China and the USA, our group is evaluating a portable, battery-powered, high-resolution microendoscope that provides subcellular, 1100x-magnified images of the esophageal epithelium.This low-cost (< $1,500) device uses a Samsung Galaxy tablet computer to display microscopic epithelial images and image-analysis software to highlight abnormal nuclei allowing a more objective, real-time means of differentiating benign from neoplastic epithelium. In our current prospective, randomized, controlled trial of ESCN screening/surveillance, our goal is to determine whether this portable device increases the accuracy, diagnostic yield and clinical impact of routine endoscopic screening by providing a more objective, accurate, in vivo diagnosis that can direct a clinician?s decision to biopsy, not biopsy, or perform endoscopic therapy. The goal of this Revision R01 is to refine and validate a low-cost (HRME + glasses < $2,100) mobile, augmented reality (AR) platform that facilitates accurate, rapid, real-time endoscopic screening by non-expert clinicians worldwide. Using AR glasses and a small tablet computer (or cell phone), microendoscopic images with a quantitative, software interpretation (neoplasia vs. no neoplasia) will be displayed in real-time, colocalized with white light endoscopic images, allowing easier, more accurate biopsy and treatment."
"9401948","PROJECT ABSTRACT ? COMPONENT A (CORE SURVEILLANCE) The Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS) was initiated in 1987 as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiative to reduce infant mortality and low birth weight. In recent years, the program has been expanded in support of CDC?s Safe Motherhood Initiative to promote healthy pregnancies and the delivery of healthy infants. PRAMS is an ongoing, population-based surveillance system designed to identify and monitor selected maternal experiences and behaviors that occur before and during pregnancy and during the child?s early infancy among a stratified sample of women delivering a live birth. Missouri PRAMS has been collecting data since 2007 about the health and well-being of women before, during and shortly after pregnancy and during the child?s early infancy. These data are not routinely available from other sources and can be used to identify groups of women and infants at high risk for health problems and adverse pregnancy / birth outcomes. Missouri PRAMS data is also extremely helpful in monitoring changes in health status of women and children in the state, identification of emerging health issues and measuring progress towards goals in improving the health of mothers and infants in Missouri. Missouri PRAMS uses a standardized data collection methodology developed in accordance with the CDC PRAMS Model Surveillance protocol required for all PRAMS grantees. This standardized approach allows for comparisons among states and for optimal use of the data for single-state or multistate analysis. Each month, a stratified random sample of women delivering a recent live birth is drawn from the state?s birth certificate file and data is collected from this sample of women through mail and telephone modes. The data is weighted so that findings can be applied to the state?s entire population of women with a recent delivery. Missouri PRAMS played a key role during Missouri?s 2015 Title V five-year Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Needs Assessment and identification Missouri?s MCH priorities for the next five years. Missouri PRAMS is the only data source for a variety of national, state performance measures and national outcome measures. Missouri PRAMS continues to be a key resource for program planning, improvement, evaluation and policy development. During this project cycle, Missouri PRAMS will continue to collect high quality data and will further enhance its efforts towards data analysis, linkages, dissemination and translation with a life-course perspective approach."
"9320157","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The etiology of Parkinson's disease is multivariate, ranging from identified genetic mutations to strict environmental causation. One environmental agent that has been shown to induce Parkinsonism is virus, including influenza. Our lab, and others, has shown that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, is neurotropic and can induce a number of Parkinsonism pathologies including loss of the DA phenotype in DA neurons, increased activation of the immune system and increased phosphorylation and aggregation of alpha- synuclein. What is unknown, at this time, is whether the induced Parkinsonian pathologies that we observed are specific to only certain strains of influenza (those known to be neurotropic (H5N1)), or can also be induced by those that do not enter the CNS, including the 1918-H1N1 influenza virus that was responsible for the Spanish flu and has been implicated in von Economo's encephalopathy and the H1N1 influenza virus strain (A/H1N1/CA/04/2009) most responsible for the 2009 pandemic. We also seek to determine the critical gene(s) responsible for influenza neurotropism. In this application, we propose 3 specific aims to investigate the role of influenza in neurodegenerative disease, concentrating on pathologies observed in Parkinson's disease. These are: 1) Identify strains of Type A Influenza that are/are not neurotropic, and identify the gene(s) within the influenza genome that confer neurotropism, 2) Determine the immune response in brain initiated by neurotropic and non-neurotropic influenza viruses, and 3) Determine if the parkinsonian pathologies induced by the H5N1 Type A Influenza virus are common to other Type A influenza viruses. The results of these studies, which utilize a unique series of chimeric influenza viruses generated between the neurotropic H5N1 and 1918-H1N1and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses, will allow us to identify the key components within the virus that allow entry into the nervous system and understand how peripheral infection can signal activation of the immune response in brain. In terms of human health, these studies will allow us to predict how current (i.e. H5N1 and H1N1) and future emerging influenza strains will impact the CNS; as well as identify targets (both known and unknown) that allow for development of therapeutic agents to interfere with these processes."
"9405651","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The chronic exposure of islets to fatty acids is believed to promote the development of diabetes in obesity by damaging ? cells. Paradoxically, fatty acids also augment insulin secretion acutely. Therefore a better understanding of the regulation of lipid metabolism in islets, especially from spatial and chronological aspects, is critical for the effective strategy to prevent adverse effects of lipid overload. Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP), found on the surface of lipid droplets in wide range of cells, is proposed to play a critical role in spatial organization of intracellular lipid metabolism through the interaction with other intracellular organelles such as cell membrane, ER, and mitochondria. The preliminary data from Dr. Imai's laboratory showed that ADFP is increased in human and mouse islets exposed to fatty acids in vivo and ex vivo. Furthermore the reduction of ADFP in insulin secreting cells (MIN6) impairs fatty acid usage and acute augmentation of insulin secretion by fatty acids. Therefore Dr. Imai hypothesizes that ADFP coated lipid droplets in ? cells are critical for the efficient use of fatty acids. They facilitate the generation of fatty acid derived signaling for insulin secretion, while preventing islet dysfunction from lipid overload. The hypothesis will be tested as below. Specific aim 1: Analyze the role of ADFP in the acute augmentation of insulin secretion by fatty acids. The importance of ADFP in this process will be confirmed by reducing ADFP in human islets using adenovirus expressing shRNA, and in vivo using ADFP deficient mice. The mechanisms by which ADFP regulates the generation of signals for insulin secretion will be studied in mouse islets using shRNA for ADFP. Specific aim 2: Analyze the role of ADFP in the development of islet dysfunction in obesity. Since ADFP may promote fatty acid utilization in ? cells, it potentially protects islet from stress of fatty acid overload. Here the efficacy of ADFP upregulation in the prevention of lipid-induced islet dysfunction will be tested using adenovirus in vitro, and using the transgenic approach in vivo. Specific aim 3: Address the roles of islet lipid droplets beyond the regulation of fatty acids-triglycerides metabolism. Recent studies in various cells indicate that the regulatory role played by lipid droplets is not limited to fatty acid metabolism. From several areas where ADFP is implicated, two pathways relevant to islet function will be studied. The change in cholesterol metabolism and eicosanoids production will be analyzed after modulating ADFP levels in MIN6 cells and mouse islets as above.  The study will provide innovative, unique information about the spatial and dynamic regulation of lipid metabolism in islets, which will aid the designing of new approaches towards the prevention and treatment of islet dysfunction commonly seen in obesity."
"9387803","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uterine leiomyoma (UL) are the most common pelvic tumor in women of reproductive age. Despite the fact that these smooth muscle tumors are benign, UL are a significant public health problem, accounting for over 200,000 hysterectomies annually, and approximately 1 in 4 women will have a UL that comes to clinical attention. Despite the high morbidity and health care costs associated with UL, the etiology is not understood, and few modifiable, protective risk factors have been identified. Dietary factors may play a role in UL etiology due to their potential to modify endogenous hormones as well as their inflammatory effects. Hypothesis/Specific Aims: Our overall hypothesis is that intake and plasma biomarker levels of dietary components that influence endogenous hormonal and inflammatory response are associated with UL risk. Few studies have examined the association between dietary factors and UL. To our knowledge, only one prospective cohort has examined the association between dairy and dietary fat intake and UL observing a reduced risk of UL with increasing dairy consumption and associations with some fatty acids. In addition, no prospective studies have examined the association with vitamin D levels. Using prospective data we will evaluate the following aims:  Aim 1. Evaluate the association between dietary fat and risk of incident uterine leiomyoma using data among 97,807 women in the NHSII cohort who completed a dietary assessment. In a subset of these women we will examine the association between circulating fatty acid levels and uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 2. Dairy food intake is associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma.  Aim 3. Vitamin D levels are associated with risk of uterine leiomyoma. Study Design: The proposed study consists of Nurses' Health Study II participants who completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) about their usual diet in 1991. Follow-up FFQs were completed in 1995, 1999, 2003, and 2007. Quintiles or categories of dietary intake will be generated and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate hazard ratios of UL incidence associated with each of the dietary factors. Among a subset of women with pre-diagnostic biomarkers, the association between plasma vitamin D and circulating fatty acids with UL risk will be assessed with logistic regression models. The presence of prospectively collected UL, dietary, and covariate data and stored blood samples, allows cost-efficient and valid consideration of the temporality of disease diagnosis - supporting the potential identification of modifiable risk factors."

"9230198","Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis with a median survival of about 6 months for patients with metastatic disease despite the use of current treatments. Therefore, PDAC is in urgent need of effective therapies. About 80% of PDAC patients exhibit mutation in KRAS, with substitution of a glycine residue at codon 12, such as KRASG12D, observed in high frequency. Many studies in mice unequivocally show that direct inhibition oncogenic KRAS significantly suppresses tumor progression. Despite such compelling evidence for the functional role of oncogenic KRAS in the PDAC pathogenesis, direct targeting of oncogenic KRAS has been elusive and it has often been dubbed as ?undruggable?. In this grant application, we propose to explore a novel approach to target oncogenic KRAS using physiological nanoparticles known as exosomes. Exosomes are 40-150 nm extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain DNA, RNA and proteins, and can deliver their contents efficiently into cells they fuse with and/or enter. Exploiting this unique feature of exosomes, our research team proposes in this grant application to test the central hypothesis that ?exosomes can be engineered to deliver RNA interference (RNAi) molecules to target KRASG12D in pancreatic cancer?. Successful completion of the proposed studies will determine whether exosomes exhibit a superior ability to deliver RNAi molecules for the treatment of pancreatic cancer when compared to liposomes. Additionally, after such increased ability is investigated using multiple experimental systems, the proposal will further identify mechanism/s associated with the enhanced efficacy of exosomes in the delivery of RNAi molecules. Collectively, the proposal is designed to enable in-depth pre-clinical studies coupled with an investigation into the unique mechanism of action of exosomes to potentially facilitate future therapeutic testing in patients with PDAC."

"9187050","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) is currently the only effective treatment for glaucoma. However, most patients with elevated IOP do not develop glaucoma, and many patients with glaucoma do not have elevated IOP. The reason for this apparent discrepancy may be related to abnormalities in the biomechanical properties of the eye that predispose towards glaucoma. However, there is currently no available method for in vivo measurement of common ocular biomechanical properties including elasticity and viscosity. As a result, no previous studies have compared these properties in normal and glaucomatous human eyes of living subjects.  In this study, we propose to assess ocular biomechanical properties by using a novel non-invasive technique termed ultrasound surface wave elastography (USWE). With this technique, a probe is used to create gentle vibrations in the tissue, and viscoelasticity is determined based on the speed of wave propagation. A unique advantage of USWE is that different tissue layers can be assessed, and viscosity can be calculated along with elasticity. Using this technique, we propose to assess the importance of ocular biomechanical properties in glaucoma. The project will be conducted in three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (SA1): Develop a normative database of ocular elasticity and viscosity; SA2: Characterize ocular biomechanical properties in newly diagnosed glaucoma patients and compare with normal controls; SA3: Refine the technique in order to optimize its ability to capture ocular data.  Characterization of in vivo ocular biomechanical properties is critical to understanding glaucoma pathogenesis. As well, the development of a novel method for measuring elasticity and viscosity in different ocular tissues would enable new avenues of research into other ocular conditions that may be affected by tissue biomechanics. Further, this technology could potentially provide a new diagnostic tool for patient care. The information obtained in this project will be an important step in achieving the long-term goals of enhancing understanding of glaucoma risk, improving patient management, and the development of novel therapies."
"9405992","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic mitral regurgitation is a common complication in the valve following myocardial infarction that increases the rates of heart failure and mortality. Mitral regurgitation is characterized by back-flow through the valve during the cardiac cycle and is caused by a geometric mismatch between the dilated left ventricle and the mitral valve in the post-infarct heart. Effective treatment for ischemic mitral regurgitation remais elusive. Recent reports demonstrate that the valve, previously assumed to be static, can undergo dynamic adaptation to geometric changes in the heart. Excessive endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) signaling in the post-infarct heart inhibits this adaptive response during ischemic mitral regurgitation and leads to valve fibrosis. In the proposed research, we will develop a local drug delivery system to target the ischemic mitral valve and release inhibitors of TGF-? signaling that have been shown to modulate excess EMT. The local delivery system will be comprised of [a drug-eluting annuloplasty ring that releases therapeutics to the leaflets of the valve (Aim I). Additionally, we will screen for TGF-? inhibitors that effectively suppress excessive EMT in valvular endothelial cells (VECs) in vitro (Aim II). The release profile of target candidate therapeutics will be tuned o dampen EMT over the course of 2 months.] Once an appropriate drug delivery formulation is developed, we aim to test the central hypothesis that local TGF-? inhibition will mitigate ischemic mitral regurgitation in a large animal model that presents ischemic mitral regurgitation (Aim III). In this manner, a strategy to intervene during ischemic mitral regurgitation is proposed that limits fibrotic remodeling of the valve and coaxes the innate growth capacity of the valve to adapt during mitral regurgitation by modulating excessive EMT and TGF-? signaling locally. [The proposed project treats ischemic mitral regurgitation by addressing the underlying biology of the valve and presents broadly enabling technologies that are poised to achieve major improvements in all forms of cardiac valve disease.]"

The McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research has a long and remarkable history for innovation and discovery in cancer biology, and is an appropriate academic and administrative home for a training program. The UW Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center (UWCCCC) was one of the first NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers and has received continuous CCSG support for the past 36 years. Together, they constitute an unparalleled training environment, with a reputation for commitment to the education of young scientists. The trainer group (26 scientists from 13 departments) is outstanding; these faculty members have trained 65 academic professors, 50 professional scientists, 39 pharmaceutical industry scientists, a journal editor and 19 clinical scientists. They have excellent funding track records (this group is supported by $14m total, and $8m dedicated cancer research funding this year). The research focus of this group is diverse, though they share a cancer emphasis. Model systems include breast, prostate, skin, head and neck, colorectal, liver and hematopoietic tumors, and their topics include genetic susceptibility, signaling pathways, the role of metabolism, tumor microenvironment, epigenetic effects, collaborating genetic factors, immune regulation, DNA damage, and the development of microfluidic technologies that enable breakthroughs of culture technique and circulating cell capture. The program will be led by Dr. Alexander (a breast cancer researcher, Era of Hope Scholar in the DOD Breast Cancer Research Program), with the assistance of Dr. Shull (Director of the McArdle Laboratory and Associate Director of the UWCCCC). Oversight is shared between members of a Program Committee, drawn together to represent viewpoints from basic, clinical and translational faculty members. The goal of this new Training Program is three-fold, 1) to provide more rigorous support of post-doctoral candidates during key phases of their career development, 2) to promote recruiting activities that focus on minority and under-served communities, and 3) to use the mentoring committee and other shared training responsibilities to catalyze discussion and scientific interaction between the research and clinical faculties. The scientific benefits of participation in the training program extends not only to the trainees funded by the training grant, but also to the other post-doctoral and pre- doctoral trainees within the participating laboratories, generating added value for this training program plan. In summary, this program will be unique on this campus for providing programmatic support for outstanding young scientists training in cancer biology, and for facilitating the translational goals of the Federal Cancer Research program, by engaging these trainees with the clinical faculty."
"9065615","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term objective of the proposed trial, International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA), is to define the role of an invasive approach in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) and substantial ischemia. The trial hypothesis is that cardiac catheterization followed by complete revascularization plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) is superior to OMT alone as the management strategy for patients with moderate-severe ischemia on stress imaging. The primary endpoint will be time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for unstable angina, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or heart failure. The hypothesis that the invasive strategy will improve quality of life will also be tested. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed.   The COURAGE and BARI 2D trials found that an initial management strategy of coronary revascularization did not reduce the risk of death or MI compared with OMT alone in SIHD patients selected on the basis of coronary anatomy. These data raise the question whether cardiac catheterization (cath) is required in stable patients. Cath in such patients usually leads to revascularization. Although COURAGE and BARI 2D included a broad range of severity of myocardial ischemia on stress testing, most patients had mild-moderate ischemia. Observational data suggest that revascularization of patients with moderate-severe ischemia is associated with a lower likelihood of death and MI; this is not observed in patients with lesser degrees of ischemia. Only about half of patients with moderate-severe ischemia are referred for cath. It is unknown whether use rates for cath and revascularization are appropriate for optimal patient management in the era of modern medical therapy (particularly with high dose statins and antiplatelet therapy). This issue cannot be resolved using available data because prior clinical trials in SIHD have enrolled patients after cath, at which point there is substantial selection bias for enrollment based on coronary anatomy. Given the potential for improved survival and fewer cardiac events as a result of revascularization and the significant expense and risks associated with invasive management, the role of an invasive strategy is critically important to define. Defining that role is among the top 100 US priorities for comparative effectiveness research.    The proposed ISCHEMIA trial will be a prospective, multicenter, international, randomized, controlled trial that will directly address the need for an invasive strategy-cath and revascularization-in patients with SIHD. A total of 8,000 patients with moderate-severe ischemia and left ventricular ejection fraction >35% will be enrolled after stress imaging from more than 400 sites. Based on the need to exclude significant left main coronary artery disease, patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo blinded coronary CT angiography. Patients will be randomized to an invasive group that will undergo routine cath with optimal revascularization, if feasible, plus OMT or to a group that receives OMT alone."

The Florida Department of Health and its state and local partners continue to value and use the data collected by PRAMS to develop and evaluate policy to affect change in supporting services to the women surveyed. Leticia Hernandez, MS, PhD, Maternal and Child Health Epidemiologist will serve as the Principal Investigator and will provide scientific and technical leadership as well as direction throughout the current grant funding period. Florida is the third most populous state in the nation with approximately 20 million residents living within 67 counties in 2015. The state is ethnically and racially diverse. The racial/ethnic composition of Florida is approximately 78 percent white and 17 percent black with 24 percent of the total population being of Hispanic origin. It ranks fourth nationally in annual live births with 22 percent of Florida?s total population less than 18 years of age and 27 percent between the ages 18 and 39, according to 2015 population estimates. The overall goals of the PRAMS program are: (1) to collect population-based data of high scientific quality on topics relating to pregnancy and early infancy; (2) to conduct data analyses in order to increase understanding of maternal behaviors and experiences during pregnancy and early infancy, and their relationship to health outcomes; (3) to translate results from analyses into useable information for planning and evaluation of public health programs and policy; and (4) to build state capacity. To address the four overarching goals of the project, Florida will conduct activities to improve its overall annual weighted response rate by 2 percent each year. Previous analyses have shown that more than half of live births in Florida are to mothers receiving Medicaid. Florida PRAMS will continue to gain access to the state?s Medicaid system as a search engine to gather up-to- date contact information to ensure increased delivery of the mail survey instrument to the selected mothers. In addition, the Florida PRAMS will continue to test incentives that increase the completion of the surveys and implement those found to be successful. Finally, Florida PRAMS will continue to engage and collaborate with state and local partners and data users to address state-specific needs."

The intent of the training program is novel, broad-based and comprehensive including basic, clinical, and population science opportunities on how obesity relates to CVD. Areas of focused training will include hypertension, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, and sudden death. Training will also be focused on treatment and prevention of obesity. During the first year 2 slots are requested, and by the 3rd year a total of 4 slots divided between the two years of training are requested. An option for a third year will be the responsibility of the trainee's mentor. Although the emphasis will be placed on physician scientists, approximately 1 of the 4 slots will be used for a PhD fellow with a specific emphasis on translational research related to obesity and CVD. The UCAMC has invested over 2.5 million dollars into a new obesity institute (Colorado Obesity Research institute, CORI) that encompasses more than 100 faculty. Of these, 33 have been identified as preceptors/mentors and include senior and mid-career investigators many of whom are nationally and internationally recognized leaders in obesity and CVD science. To our knowledge there is no other program in the USA that has this focus, and in the current environment of the epidemic of obesity throughout the developed and developing world the need for targeted advanced training in how obesity relates to CVD is more than timely. The goal of recruiting, fostering and developing academic obesity/CVD translational scientists through this program will be completely dependent on this NHLBI training grant."
"9179659","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this research is to determine the effects of marijuana (MJ) on brain connectivity in adolescents, and to establish whether such influences on complex neural networks are more pronounced in biological relatives of schizophrenia (SZ) patients. This proposal is significant because it will provide new information about the potential hazards adolescent MJ exposure poses to public health. Adolescent MJ use is a known environmental risk factor for SZ. MJ is also the most commonly used illicit drug among adolescents in the U.S. where first MJ exposure often occurs in mid-adolescence. Recent youth surveys report rising MJ usage, persistent easy MJ access, and declining perception that MJ is harmful. Activation of cannabinoid receptors is vital in regulating neural cell survival, brain development and neuroplasticity. Animal studies provide clear evidence that tetrahydrocannabinol present in MJ is deleterious to the brain, especially during the sensitive period of adolescent brain maturation. However, human neuroimaging studies have been contradictory partly due to the absence of longitudinal data on human adolescents. To address these gaps in knowledge, we will conduct a prospective MRI study of healthy adolescent volunteers without family history of SZ (HNV), and a matched sample of first-degree relatives of SZ patients. At study entry, subjects have no prior MJ use. Targeted recruitment strategies and close attention to promote subject retention will be utilized. Brain anatomic, diffusion-weighted magnetization transfer ratio, and resting-state functional MRI data are obtained at intake and 3 years later. Using reliable and well-validated assessment protocols at 6-monthly intervals, subjects will be monitored for onset and severity of emergent MJ use (expected to be 25% of intake sample). This prospective study design will yield 4 informative comparison groups (stratified by MJ use and SZ family history) providing an explicit test to reveal the unique effect of adolescent MJ exposure and of familial SZ risk on longitudinal brain changes. Specific Aims 1 and 2 utilize state-of-the-art statistical analyses to assess the impact of emergent MJ use on within-subject changes in brain structural integrity, and on differential effects in SZ relatives. he hypothesis is that adolescents with emergent MJ use will show deficits in structural brain integrity. Against a background of genetic vulnerability for SZ, biological relatives will be more susceptible to MJ's deleterious effects. Specific Aim 3 uses novel graph theory methods to quantify the topographical properties of brain structural and functional connectivity. The influence of adolescent MJ use on changes in brain network organization will be contrasted between HNV and SZ relatives. Specific Aim 4 explores secondary outcomes of neurocognition, personality traits and prodromal symptoms to develop integrative models to explain the adolescent MJ-SZ link. Thus, this proposal with its longitudinal study design and innovative network connectivity measures will advance knowledge regarding the impact adolescent MJ exposure has on public health and on SZ susceptibility."
"9405691","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks to establish a new NIH-funded T32 program to train the next generation of physician- scientists in gastrointestinal oncology. We believe that physician-scientists armed with rigorous research training are necessary to discover and translate new advances in gastrointestinal oncology as well as to investigate critical issues facing delivery of cancer care to patients. Our trainees will be drawn from NYU's renowned clinical fellowship programs in Medical Oncology or Gastroenterology or top-notch residency programs in Radiation Oncology or Surgery. Recruiting individuals from underrepresented minority groups will be paramount. Trainees will take a 2 year hiatus from clinical activities to engage in intensive full-time training in GI cancer research. Our proposed program will have 2 distinct tracks: (i) a Basic/Translational Science track aimed at individuals who wish to direct their own basic science laboratory in GI oncology or individuals who want to lead translational research programs that comfortably interface between the pre-clinical laboratory and clinical investigation and (ii) a Population Sciences tract for trainees who seek careers as cutting edge GI cancer clinical trialists or in the diverse fields of population science such as cancer epidemiology, comparative effectiveness, disparities, or outcomes research. The two tracks will be united through a weekly 2-hour core curriculum covering essential topics in GI cancer and critical lessons for cancer physicians embarking on independent investigative careers. The track-specific program for our Basic/Translational Science track will consist of two years of individualized mentored research in faculty laboratories, enhanced by a strong parallel didactic program in cancer biology. The Population Sciences track will be centered on a rigorous Masters-level curriculum that teaches clinical trial design, epidemiology, comparative-effectiveness, and outcomes research methodologies along with a mentored research project based in population sciences. Thus, physician-trainees will train intensively in basic or translational GI oncology or population sciences and thereby acquire the necessary skills to head a basic or translational laboratory, lead innovative clinical trials, and/or develop a population science program. We plan to enroll 3 new post-doctoral candidates annualy for a steady-state of 6 trainees at any given time. Our program will be led by a cadre of mentors with significant accomplishments and impeccable reputations in cancer research and stellar training records. The program will be supported by the rich Multidisciplinary GI Cancer Program at NYU which is a significant institutional strength that currently houses ~35 clinical trials in GI oncolgy. The aim of the fellowship will be to graduate physician-scientists armed with the capacity and credentials to lead their own research programs and eventually become leaders and role models in investigative GI oncology. We expect that all our graduates will finish their training armed with well-developed K-level grants to bring to their first academic appointment and we expect this program will become the paradigm for training physician-investigators in GI cancer research."
"9388622","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new T32 application from the University of Washington (UW) focuses on a novel and important area of research - palliative care research for heart, lung, and blood diseases. Our aging population and advances in chronic disease management have combined to create an enormous need for improved palliative care research across diverse diseases. Heart, lung, and blood diseases encompass leading causes of death and disability in the US, and represent areas where palliative care research has lagged behind compared to cancer. This application differs from any existing T32 programs at UW or elsewhere by focusing on training in palliative care research for patients with heart, lung, and blood diseases. Additionally, because health disparities in palliative care have been well documented, this innovative training program focuses on understanding and eliminating these disparities. This proposal capitalizes on the exceptional faculty and academic environment across multiple schools (Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and Social Work) and multiple Divisions within the School of Medicine; it also builds upon a close working relationship with our NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) that will support research training. Dr. J. Randall Curtis, the program director, is a national leader in palliative care research and has been the recipient of a K24 Award for mentoring from NHLBI for 10 years. He is also the Director of the new UW Palliative Care Center of Excellence which will support this proposed T32. We have developed a rigorous research training program built on four core principles to prepare new researchers for independent careers: 1) Trainees must master a defined set of research and writing skills necessary to advance to independent, yet collaborative investigators; 2) Structured and comprehensive research mentoring is critical to retaining trainees in science; 3) Research projects must be tailored to each trainee and designed to be successful training vehicles that facilitate early academic productivity; 4) Training in palliative care research shoul provide opportunities for interdisciplinary interactions and promote team science. To continuously improve our training program, we will assess the effectiveness of our methods for training and mentoring using well-defined metrics, and adjust our methods as necessary. We are requesting 4 post-doctoral training slots and trainees will complete a two-year training program. This application represents an important opportunity to advance palliative care research concerning heart, lung, and blood diseases, and to create a research workforce for the future."
"9245972","PROJECT SUMMARY Newborns are severely affected by infection. Immunization is one of the most effective strategies to prevent infection but many vaccines do not work optimally in early life. Our understanding of the mechanisms leading to vaccine-induced protection is early life is very limited. This relates in part to the small sample volumes obtainable, and the fact that the host response to vaccination in the newborn is complicated by a rapidly shifting developmental program and presence of maternal antibodies (MatAbs). Our Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) team has developed a robust protocol that allows the full force of systems vaccinology (transcriptomics, proteomics, immune profiling; collectively called OMIC) to be applied with < 2ml of blood. We also have developed the informatics tools to decipher the impact of rapidly changing host immune status as well as MatAbs. Lastly, we developed in vitro platforms that enable assessment of cause-effect relationships. We have proven the feasibility of this comprehensive approach in a pilot (Expanded Program on Immunization Consortium; EPIC) study. We are now proposing to employ our state-of-the-art experimental and informatics pipeline to characterize vaccine-induced molecular pathways in newborns correlating with hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) immunogenicity. HBV was chosen as the model, because it is the only newborn vaccine with a clearly established, quantifiable correlate of protection (CoP). The goal of the Clinical Core (CC) is to define the impact on HBV responses of both basal characteristics (immune status, MatAbs, etc) and of co-administration of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Enrollment of newborns for a training- and test-set of samples at the Medical Research Council (MRC)-Gambia (CC-Site 1) will be followed by validation of key signatures in a cohort in Papua New Guinea (PNG; CC-Site 2). Given their longstanding and proven track records, both CC-Sites are particularly well suited to conduct these studies. Across both CCs, we will use identical vaccines, clinical and laboratory protocols and reagents. We approach this via 4 Specific Aims: 1) Enroll well-defined cohorts of Gambian newborns for in vivo OMIC profiling and in vitro responses following immunization with HBV ± BCG; 2) Measure adaptive immune responses to HBV, enabling correlation of in vivo OMIC signatures and in vitro vaccine modeling assays with established CoP; 3) Measure MatAbs in relation to vaccine-induced neonatal and infant OMIC vaccine signatures and adaptive responses; 4) Validate key signatures identified in a distinct independent PNG newborn cohort. Overall, the proposed CC will enable characterization and validation of vaccine-induced OMIC signatures and assessment of their potential to predict CoP. These studies will ultimately define mechanisms that will inform development of vaccine formulations optimized for early life immunization."
"9397767","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed training program at the University of Washington is a competing renewal of an existing T32 training grant on Comprehensive Training in Interdisciplinary Oral Health Research, but it technically is being submitted as a new proposal in response to PAR-10-170 for T90/R90 programs, which allows for a limited number of non-citizen postdoctoral trainees.

"9393398","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been a long history of cardiovascular research at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC). Much of this research has been conducted in the Department of Physiology where their efforts are directed toward developing a quantitative and integrated analysis of the cardiovascular and renal systems. In addition both basic and clinical research on hypertension and cardio-renal diseases at UMMC have expanded in various departments and programs such as Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Neurosciences, Medicine, Endocrinology, Emergency Medicine, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. UMMC also serves as the Examination Center for the Jackson Heart Study that has a major focus on cardiovascular disease in African Americans. UMMC has also been a participant is several major clinical trials such as ALLHAT. Thus, UMMC has a diversity of basic, clinical, and population research programs in cardiovascular diseases. The main objective of the multidisciplinary Hypertension and Cardiorenal Diseases Research (HCDR) Training Program is to recruit, train, and mentor pre-doctoral and postdoctoral students in hypertension and cardiovascular and renal research so that they become the next generation of researchers in this field. To achieve this goal the Cardiovascular-Renal Research Center (CRRC) at UMMC continues to provide a stimulating and productive mentoring environment for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral students. The HCDR Training Program not only capitalizes on the expertise of a strong group of basic science and clinical investigators in the field of cardiovascular and renal research at UMMC but also the resources provided by these established laboratories and the CRRC core facilities. The specific aims of this training grant renewal are as follows: 1. To train pre-doctoral students (3) in a multi-disciplinary approach in course work and research opportunities in hypertension and cardiovascular-renal disease research. 2. To provide postdoctoral students (6) multi-disciplinary training and mentoring in hypertension and cardiovascular-renal disease research 3. To recruit, train, and retain minority pre-doctoral and postdoctoral students in hypertension and cardiovascular-renal diseases research. Continued funding of the HCDR training program at UMMC would increase the quality and quantity of trainees in this multi-disciplinary program and greatly enhance our ability to train the next generation of biomedical scientists in hypertension and cardio-renal diseases research."
"9378868","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goals of the Cancer Cell Biology Program are: (i) to understand, at the molecular and cellular levels, mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to therapeutic treatment, and (ii) to identify and validate new targets for cancer therapy. Insight derived from these studies, when integrated with research and development from other programs, will provide targets and guidance for the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer. Toward these two goals, the Program faculty investigates various aspects of cancer cell biology, including growth factors and receptors; angiogenesis and vascular biology; apoptosis; cell cycle regulation; chromatin biochemistry and transcriptional regulation; cell microstructure and function; DNA replication and repair; metabolism; regulatory RNA; and signal transduction. Led by two co-leaders with complementary expertise, Yue Xiong and James Bear, the program organizes these different areas into four major research themes: (1) Cell Cycle, (2) Cell Signaling, (3) Cell Movement and Organization, and (4) Epigenetics and Chromatin Biology. The major emphasis of the Program is to foster integrated research that spans these inter-related themes, enhancing the research and translational capabilities of program investigators through the establishment, expansion and utilization of appropriate core facilities, and promoting interactions with investigators from other LCCC basic, clinical and population sciences programs.           The Cancer Cell Biology Program consists of 45 members who are associated with 7 basic science and 4 clinical departments at UNC-Chapel Hill. During the last funding period, program members have published 644 cancer-related articles (30% collaborative). In 2014, our program members held 101 grants and $27.3M (total cost) in annual extramural funding, including 24 grants and $5.8M (total costs) from the NCI."
"9401942","Project Summary/Abstract  The overall goal of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is to collect data to improve the health of infants and mothers in the preconception, perinatal, or postpartum periods. Massachusetts (MA) has implemented PRAMS since 2007. PRAMS data were the first to quantify the oral health needs of pregnant and postpartum women in MA, and served as a catalyst to developing the MA Perinatal Oral Health Practice Guidelines for Pregnancy and Early Childhood. Concerning other areas of interest, reliable data are even more limited or nonexistent. For example, MA did not have population-based data on postpartum depression. PRAMS data supported the passage of ?An Act Relative to Postpartum Depression? bill in 2010 and since then new programs such as the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) for Moms have begun to address maternal depression in MA. In addition, PRAMS data supported the selection of a mental health priority for the MA five-year Maternal and Child Health Title V Block Grant by including questions on social connectedness.  MA is in a unique position to conduct linkages with its Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data system, a longitudinal database which includes a range of datasets linked together. Linkage of PRAMS and PELL data provides an innovative, longitudinal data system with a range of information on preconception and interconception health and health care utilization. It enables an assessment of the associations between maternal characteristics, experiences, attitudes and behaviors before, during and shortly after pregnancy with longer-term health outcomes (e.g. maternal and infant mortality, and subsequent maternal and infant hospital utilization and associated costs), which cannot be ascertained from a linkage of PRAMS data to birth certificate data alone.  PRAMS methodology uses a mail survey with telephone follow up to inquire about maternal attitudes, experiences and behaviors. There are approximately 72,000 births annually, of which 2,400 are sampled for inclusion in MA PRAMS. The overall weighted response rate was 66.1%, 68.5%, and 67.5%, for 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively."
"9379774","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As patients are living longer with HIV, non-AIDS events have become major causes of morbidity and mortality. Chronic HIV infection is characterized by a state of persistent inflammation and immune activation. Chronic inflammation may contribute to the development of non-AIDS diseases (including cardiovascular disease and frailty) by precipitating dysregulation of the body's normal response to tissue injury and promoting tissue fibrosis instead of normal wound healing. Fibrosis may be a common precursor of end- organ disease in HIV-infected (HIV+) persons, but associations between markers of fibrosis and clinical disease are understudied, and therapies to prevent and treat fibrotic disease in HIV+ persons are lacking. CANDIDATE'S BACKGROUND AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT: I am a physician scientist whose research focuses on understanding the pathophysiology of and developing novel therapies for the inflammation- associated, metabolic complications of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART). As an Early Stage Investigator, my long-term goals are to transition to independence and become a leader in my field. To accomplish this, my short-term goals include conducting high-quality, patient-oriented research (see Research Strategy) and obtaining necessary additional training. I have experience and training in Infectious Diseases and the design and conduct of HIV clinical trials. However, the study of inflammation-related disease in HIV requires knowledge of both normal and pathological immunologic and physiologic processes, including laboratory techniques for determining mechanisms of disease. Similarly, while I have a Master of Science in Clinical Research degree, advanced data analysis and statistical skills will help me to become an independent investigator. For the K23 award period, I have outlined a combination of formal didactic coursework and mentored tutorials in normal immunology and physiology, the pathophysiology of inflammation-related disease, laboratory science and advanced data analysis. I have also assembled a group of mentors with expertise in HIV clinical trials, translational research, viro-immunology, endocrinology and metabolism. This combination of mentorship, didactic training and a strong research vision will facilitate my transition to independence. RESEARCH PROPOSAL: The proposed projects will provide a novel description of circulating fibrosis markers by HIV status, define associations between circulating markers of fibrosis and clinical estimates of end-organ disease (including immune function), and test an innovative anti-fibrotic therapy. Specifically, I aim  1. To assess relationships between circulating markers of fibrosis and end-organ disease in HIV+ and HIV- participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Fibrosis is a transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1)-mediated process that leads to hyaluronic acid (HA) deposition in injured tissues. TGF-b1 and HA levels correlate with tissue fibrosis severity in inflammatory diseases other than HIV, and HA correlates with hepatic fibrosis in HIV. However, it is unknown whether TGF-b1 and HA can predict non-hepatic disease severity in HIV+ persons. Using MACS blood samples, TGF-b1 and HA levels will be measured and associated with clinical disease estimates (including lean muscle mass, bone density, and atherosclerotic plaque burden) after controlling for confounding factors. We hypothesize that 1) TGF-b1 and HA levels will be higher in HIV+ than HIV- participants, and 2) TGF-b1 and HA levels will be positively associated with end- organ disease severity in all participants, but the associations will be stronger in HIV+ participants. 2. To assess relationships between circulating markers of fibrosis, immune activation and immune reconstitution on ART in HIV+ MACS participants. Lymphoid tissue fibrosis occurs early in HIV infection and can prevent CD4+ T cell recovery on ART, but relationships between markers of fibrosis, CD4+ T cell counts and T cell activation have not been described. Using a case control design, circulating TGF-b1, HA and CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ T cell counts will be measured from MACS samples and compared between immunologic responders and non-responders to ART after controlling for confounding factors. We hypothesize that non-responders will have higher TGF-b1, HA and activated CD8+ T cell levels than responders. 3. To assess the effects of telmisartan on fibrotic and inflammatory contributors to end-organ disease in HIV+ persons well controlled on ART. Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker and PPAR-g agonist approved for the treatment of essential hypertension. Telmisartan improves markers of inflammation and fibrosis in HIV- populations. AIDS Clinical Trials Group study A5317 Effects of Telmisartan on Fibrotic and Inflammatory Contributors to End-Organ Disease in HIV+ Patients Well Controlled on ART (Lake, PI), is an investigator-initiated, two-arm, 48-week, randomized (2:1), open label trial of the effects of standard dose telmisartan in treated HIV infection. We hypothesize that telmisartan will improve lymph node fibrosis, subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrosis and blood and tissue markers of fibrosis, inflammation and immune activation in HIV+ patients on suppressive ART (compared to control). It will be the first study to assess the effects of telmisartan on fibrosis in HIV+ persons."
"9361449","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung pathology is a significant cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory virus infection. Respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus not only cause damage to the epithelium, but activate immune defense mechanisms. Although these immune mechanisms are employed to destroy and remove infected cells in an attempt to clear the virus, they can also promote lung pathology. However, the key cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between protection and tissue damage during acute viral infection remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge severely limits the development of novel therapies to treat the disease. Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms whereby respiratory viral infection induces lung damage is critical for the development of improved therapies for treatment of disease. Our exciting and intriguing preliminary results suggest that the lymphotoxin beta receptor, LTßR, a member of the TNFR superfamily, promotes influenza-associated lung damage. The overall objective of this proposal is to define how LT?R controls lung damage associated with influenza infection. Our working hypothesis is that LT?R signaling in respiratory epithelial cells inhibits mucus production during influenza infection allowing for elevated viral replication and increased lung damage. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use biochemical and genetic approaches to determine the impact of LT?R signaling on mucus production and viral replication. In Aim 2, we will test that LT?R signaling in respiratory epitheial cells is essential to promote lung immunopathology during influenza infection. We propose that LT?R signaling in respiratory epithelial cells promotes viral replication and induction of potent inflammatory responses which cause severe lung damage. Completion of these aims will define the LT?R-dependent mechanisms that contribute to lung damage. The research proposed is significant, because it will provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating virus-induced immunopathology and will help in developing new immunotherapeutic strategies to control respiratory disease."
