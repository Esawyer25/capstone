"9238036","Abstract A person, usually a child, dies of rabies every nine minutes globally. Current rabies virus (RABV) post- exposure prophylaxis (PEP) remains complicated and costly, requiring four to five doses of inactivated RABV- based vaccine plus rabies immune globulin (RIG). A single-dose vaccine that does not require expensive and often unavailable RIG would greatly increase the efficacy of RABV vaccination, reduce the cost associated with rabies prevention, and save lives. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how B cells are activated in response to RABV-based vaccination. For the last 35 years, B cells secreting IgG (but not IgM) were thought to be solely responsible for vaccine-induced protection against RABV infection via T cell-dependent responses in post-exposure settings. Furthermore, mechanisms by which B cells acquire RABV antigen were not previously known. Our laboratory has begun to unravel key attributes of rabies-specific B cell responses that contribute to the rapid induction of vaccine-induced virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs). We showed that vaccine-induced T cell-independent (TI) and early extrafollicular T cell-dependent (TD) B cell responses, including neutralizing IgM, can limit dissemination of pathogenic RABV into the CNS, providing partial protection in mice. We also showed that free rabies particles migrate to subcapsular sinus macrophages in the draining lymph node, transferring RABV antigen directly to B cells. We aim to exploit these findings to develop a single-dose RABV vaccine regimen. Specifically, we hypothesize that a replication-deficient, matrix gene-deleted RABV-based vaccine (RABV-?M) with enhanced tropism to follicular B cells will result in antigen-specific B cells rapidly differentiating into IgM and IgG plasma cells, thereby increasing the kinetics, magnitude and quality of early B cell responses. In this proposal, our goals are to clone, recover and characterize RABV-?M-based vaccines with enhanced tropism to follicular B cells. Next, the new vaccines will be tested in well-described mouse models of rabies immunogenicity and post-exposure protection. Finally, we will confirm that the genetic modifications introduced into RABV-?M do not adversely affect safety and stability. In addition to expanding our knowledge of RABV immunity, key insights will be gained regarding how viral vaccines interact with and activate follicular B cells to induce rapid and potent immunity against viral infections. The major milestone at the completion of this project is the identification of a safe vaccination regimen that induces potent and rapid TI and extrafollicular TD B cell responses more effectively than the multi-dose human rabies vaccine, without the need for RIG. In summary, single-dose vaccine strategies capable of eliciting rapid and robust B cell responses will improve the efficacy of human rabies vaccines, reduce the cost associated with rabies prevention and save lives."

"9386260","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injection drug users (IDU) are at risk for a host of medical complications including blood-borne viral (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C) and bacterial (e.g., skin abscesses, endocarditis) infections. While prior studies have examined the effectiveness of risk reduction strategies to prevent HIV and Hepatitis C, there has been little focus on preventing bacterial infections among IDUs, despite the fact that these infections are very common, associated with costly emergency department visits and hospitalization, and lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. We recently developed and pilot-tested a promising brief, two-session risk reduction intervention aimed at reducing both bacterial and viral infections (Skin and Needle Hygiene Intervention or Skin). Six- month outcomes from the Skin R21 demonstrated feasibility and promising pilot results including excellent session and follow-up rates, sustained intervention effects on skin and needle cleaning skills, and lower bacterial infection risk among intervention participants. The current proposal is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Skin intervention, compared to an assessment-only condition (both groups receive rapid HIV testing, a review of testing results, and brief HIV prevention counseling) among 350 hospitalized IDUs. In the general hospital setting, the prevalence of injection drug use is high, patients who otherwise might not seek care are accessible, and the presence of a drug-related illness can set the stage for patients to be more receptive to interventions. We hypothesize that the Skin intervention will produce better outcomes than assessment-only as shown by data collected at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month(s) post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 1) bacterial infections, 2) participation in high-risk injection practices for bacterial infections (subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, no skin cleaning prior to injection) and viral infections (sharing injection equipment), and 3) health services use. We will also examine whether changes in skin hygiene and injection technique may be mediating the effect of the Skin intervention on acquisition of bacterial infections. The Skin intervention, if effective, will reduce the acquisition of bacterial and viral infections among IDUs, improving health outcomes for this population and producing health care cost savings. Recruitment of IDUs in the hospital setting broadens the possibility of widespread adoption of this novel intervention heightens the public health impact."

"9218684","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Atopic dermatitis, asthma, and other allergic diseases pose an enormous socioeconomic burden in the United States and worldwide. Current treatment options for these illnesses are, however, limited in efficacy and lead to symptomatic relief in only subsets of patients. More broadly effective therapies against allergic diseases are desperately needed, yet achieving this imperative requires an advanced understanding of their pathogenic mechanisms and identification of new therapeutic targets. The protein kinase p38? is expressed in most mammalian cell types, and activated by a multitude of immunological signals such as microbial stimuli and cytokines. We have been studying the role of p38? in immunity and inflammation using mice with p38? gene deficiency in various cell types. These efforts led us to discover that p38? in skin epithelial cells played a crucial role in driving atopic dermatitis-like inflammation upon allergen challenge. p38? signaling was found to serve pro-allergic functions via promoting the expression of inflammatory mediators in epithelial cells. We identified the matrix metalloproteinase MMP13 as an epithelial enzyme whose expression was dependent on p38? signaling. Importantly, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of MMP13 suppressed allergic skin and airway inflammation in mice. These findings and other preliminary data suggested the p38?-MMP13 axis as a promising therapeutic target for allergic diseases. In the proposed research, we will seek to validate the importance of the p38?-MMP13 axis in allergen-specific immune sensitization and allergic tissue inflammation. Further, we will perform biochemical analysis of cultured cells and recombinant proteins to establish the molecular pathways underlying p38?-dependent MMP13 expression and MMP13-mediated inflammatory responses. To achieve these goals, we will pursue the following specific aims: to determine the role of epithelial p38? signaling and MMP13 activity in mouse models of atopic dermatitis and asthma (Aim #1); to elucidate the mechanisms linking p38? signaling to MMP13 expression in skin and airway epithelial cells (Aim #2); and to identify the proteolytic targets of MMP13 that contribute to regulating allergic inflammation (Aim #3). The proposed research is expected to reveal the precise pathophysiological functions of p38? and MMP13 during allergic inflammation and the therapeutic potential of targeting the p38?-MMP13 axis in atopic dermatitis and asthma. The molecular mechanisms newly identified in our study will expand the sphere of knowledge about cell signaling in allergic disorders."
"9316299","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This A1 renewal R01 application is submitted in response to PA-12-025 Alcohol impairment of immune function, host defense and tissue homeostasis. The overall goal of the project is to define the mechanism(s) by which alcohol intoxication exacerbates post-burn pulmonary inflammation and renders subjects unable to combat infectious pathogens. Nearly 40,000 people are admitted to hospitals annually in the United States due to burn injury, and about half of those patients are intoxicated at the time of injury. Burn patients who were intoxicated when they sustained their injuries had increased morbidity and mortality compared to burn patients who had not been drinking. Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are among the major complications seen in intoxicated burn patients, even in the absence of inhalation injury. Macrophages play a central role in both the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses in the lung by exhibiting either a pro-inflammatory M1 or an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. We hypothesize that alcohol intoxication at the time of burn injury alters lung macrophage phenotype and function and that these cells are responsible for 1) excessive pulmonary inflammation, 2) the inability to combat respiratory pathogens and 3) aberrant lung function to a greater extent than burn injury alone. Moreover, restoring macrophage phenotype will reestablish pulmonary homeostasis and improve lung function. To test this, we will use the clinically relevant mouse binge ethanol intoxication and burn injury model which we have been using in the lab for 18 years. In Aim 1, we will examine alveolar macrophage initiation and resolution of the pulmonary inflammation after intoxication and burn by selectively depleting alveolar macrophages. We will also deplete alveolar macrophages in wild type, uninjured mice, and then utilize adoptive transfer methodology to replace them with alveolar macrophages from 1) intoxicated mice or 2) IL-6 knockout (KO) mice, prior to injury. In Aim 2, we will examine the phenotype and function of alveolar macrophages before and after intoxication and burn. We will also test whether pulmonary inflammation can be reduced by replacing alveolar macrophages with those of macrophage-specific arginase 1 KO animals prior to intoxication and burn. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate how intoxication alters signaling in alveolar macrophages, focusing on crosstalk between PPAR¿ and STAT3 pathways. In those studies, we will use macrophage-specific PPAR¿ KO and STAT3ß KO mice to test whether manipulating macrophage signaling can reduce lung inflammation and improve pulmonary function. Overall, the results of these studies will gain insight into the mechanisms by which alcohol alters alveolar macrophage function and phenotype and how this plays a role in the pulmonary inflammatory response after burn injury. We believe that this work will also aid in the development of therapies for all burn patients, and that these results may also benefit other patient populations, such as those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
"9239296","Summary Regulators of Th2 inflammation at the barrier interface in chronic allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma are not as well characterized as those in the initiation phase. Yet effector functions of leukocytes in the chronic phase of Th2 inflammation drive symptomatic human disease that results in immune pathology associated with much morbidity after usually asymptomatic allergen sensitization. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that control leukocyte recruitment and inflammation by binding specific receptors on target cells. We recently discovered that the human chemokine CCL18 is a novel agonist of the CCR8 receptor. CCL18 is a signature chemokine produced by Th2 cytokine differentiated IL-4 spectrum macrophages, M(IL-4)s, also known as alternatively activated or M2 macrophages. CCL18 is associated with several chronic and eosinophilic inflammatory human diseases, and is one of the most highly induced chemokines in lesional atopic dermatitis skin. M(IL-4) interactions with the recently discovered Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) have been shown to facilitate eosinophilic inflammation. CCR8 is also a top signature gene of the mouse ILC2 transcriptome. Recently IL-4R? blockade, which inhibits M(IL-4) differentiation, resulted in striking clinical improvement of treatment refractory atopic dermatitis that highly correlated with suppression of CCL18. Yet, whether and how CCL18 and M(IL-4)s sustain chronic atopic dermatitis pathology is not known. Our published and new preliminary data lead us to hypothesize that though M(IL-4)s are anti-inflammatory in acute inflammation, they undergo pathogenic transformation at barrier interfaces to become pro-inflammatory in chronic inflammation, and partly through the CCR8 pathway and other mediators, and local interactions with cells such as ILC2s sustain chronic eosinophilic allergic inflammation in the skin. To test this hypothesis we will use a model of chronic allergic dermatitis. We also discovered a novel mouse chemokine agonist of the CCR8 receptor that is a functional analog of CCL18. We thus propose to: (1) Determine if M(IL-4)s are crucial for chronic allergic inflammation and identify mechanisms by which they do so, and if this is regulated by the CCR8 pathway; and (2) Define how ILC2s contribute to chronic allergic inflammation and if this is mediated by the CCR8 pathway. We will determine the clinical correlates of the studies proposed in Aims 1 and 2 using clinical specimens from individuals with eczema that will be compared to healthy controls."
"9058596","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: Chronic immune activation, which can persist even with antiretroviral therapy, is the strongest predictor of disease progression in HIV infection. Understanding the mechanism of chronic immune activation may help identify novel targets for therapeutic interventions in HIV-infection. Extensive evidence from literature suggests that HIV disease directly or indirectly activates monocyte/macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines which play a major role in this pathogenic immune activation. Monocytes from HIV infected individuals are known to secrete cytokines spontaneously, although the mechanism for this or the molecules involved are not known. PD-1H is a newly discovered member of the B7/CD28 family of costimulatory and coinhibitory receptors, which has not been characterized in humans so far. Data to date suggest that the molecule may be derived from a different precursor than all other B7 family members. Although, amongst the B7/CD28 family, the full length sequence of PD-1H has the highest similarity to the negative regulatory molecule PD-1, unlike PD-1, the cytoplasmic domain of PD-1H does not contain the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) or the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Our preliminary data shows that PD- 1H is broadly expressed on hematopoietic cells with higher levels of expression on monocytes. Enforced overexpression of PD-1H in human monocytes is sufficient to induce spontaneous secretion of multiple cytokines. Further, monocytes from HIV-infected individuals overexpress PD-1H which correlates with cytokine gene expression in monocytes and immune activation markers on T cells but not with viral load. Based on these data, we hypothesize that PD-1H acts as a monocyte activation molecule that plays a major role in HIV pathogenesis. In this proposal we will test this hypothesis and evaluate how ART influences this process using PBMCs from defined stages of HIV disease and humanized BLT model which recapitulates key features of HIV pathogenesis, including immune activation. Our specific aims are to: 1) To characterize the evolution of PD-1h over expression in relation to immune activation, plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels, CD4 T cell depletion and plasma viremia using defined groups of HIV infected individuals. 2) Characterize PD-1H expression at different time points during the course of HIV infection in humanized BLT mice vis-?-vis viral load, CD4 T cell counts and immune activation defined by monocyte associated biomarkers/cytokines and activation markers on T cells. We will also test how PD-1H expression changes after ART, in relation to other parameters and 3) Test if silencing PD-1H or related molecules in humanized mice reverses immune activation or affects other parameters of HIV infection with or without ART."
"9205081","PROJECT SUMMARY DISEASE MODELING PROJECT (DMP)  The overall goal of the Indiana University/The Jackson Laboratory Alzheimer's Disease Precision Models  Center (IU/JAX ADPMC) is to develop, characterize and distribute more precise preclinical models for  Alzheimer's disease (AD). The IU/JAX ADPMC Disease Modeling Development and Phenotyping Project will  use CRISPR genome editing to generate mouse models that carry different combinations of human risk alleles  for late-onset AD (LOAD). In addition, some of the most widely used existing models for AD will be fully  characterized to develop more clinically relevant phenotyping platforms. We have assembled a team of experts  in human and mouse genetics, mouse models of AD, genome editing, genomic approaches to understand  complex diseases (including sequencing and computational modeling) and various biological processes  implicated in AD (including APP processing, cholesterol trafficking, neuroinflammation and vascular biology).  We have three specific aims. Aim 1 is to fully characterize APP/PS1, 5xFAD and hTau, three of the most  widely used mouse models of AD. APP/PS1 and 5xFAD carry a combination of mutations in amyloid precursor  protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1) that cause early-onset AD (EOAD) in humans. APP/PS1 and 5xFAD  have been widely used to study amyloidosis and neuroinflammation. hTau carries human wild type microtubule  associated protein Tau (MAPT) in the absence of mouse Mapt and develops age-related MAPT  hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and some neurodegeneration. We will also extensively characterize a new  model of LOAD that we have created that carries the two greatest genetic risk factors for LOAD, APOE?4 and  TREM2R47H. We will prioritize clinically relevant endpoints including in vivo imaging, blood and tissue  biomarkers and genomics, and compare these to more traditionally used endpoints such as behavioral assays  that have not proven reliable when translated to the clinic. In Aim 2, we will generate mice carrying 40 new  allelic variants identified through the Bioinformatics and Data Management Core and use an efficient in vivo  screening strategy to determine the promising models to pass through to deep phenotyping. In the early years  of the center we will prioritize understanding GWAS variants (ABCA7, BIN1 and CR1) as well as variations in  two genes identified by us from analyses of the AD Sequencing Project (NANOS1) and AD Neuroimaging  Initiative (IL1RAP). All models created will be made available at the earliest opportunity through the JAX AD  Mouse Mutant Resource (ADMMR). In Aim 3, we will fully characterize models that show important AD-  relevant phenotypes including amyloid deposition, tau pathology and neurodegeneration using the deep  phenotyping strategy described in Aim 1. All new findings will be validated in human tissues. Throughout this  funding period, we anticipate 40 new models will be generated and distributed, and up to 8 new and 4 existing  models will be extensively characterized. Our strategy closely integrates human and mouse data, so these new  AD models will show a high degree of clinical translatability for preclinical testing of new therapeutic targets.   "

The Core is led by experts in preclinical imaging, neuropharmacology, and animal model characterization at  IU?s Center for Neuroimaging and JAX?s Mouse Neurobehavioral Phenotyping, In Vivo Imaging, and  Physiology Core facilities, and supported by IU?s Clinical Pharmacology Analytical Core. The pipeline?s primary  and secondary screens focus on generating pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker  assessments in two new generation AD mouse models with construct validity. Only test compounds that  demonstrate target engagement in the biomarker screens will move to tertiary screening for in vivo symptom  modifying effects and determination of the novel compound?s therapeutic window. The specific aims of the  PTC are (1) the establishment of a standardized testing pipeline, the development of the assay protocols and  methods, the creation of the data repository and back-translating clinical compound failures; (2) validating the  pipeline with two compounds currently in clinical trials in two biologically and pathologically relevant animal  models; (3) the evaluation of novel test compounds through the pipeline which allows investigators in the  greater AD research community with unprecedented access to a validated pipeline, standardized testing  protocols, and resources to screen compounds of interest."
"9322803","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract The central aim of the proposed research is to define a novel signaling mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mediating the interaction between cardiac myocytes and nonmyocytes which is essential for proper heart development and function, using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model system. Perturbations of the intercellular communication between cardiac myocytes and nonmyocytes are a major source of cardiac arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death and heart failure. A better understanding of the functional interactions between cardiac myocytes and nonmyocytes is therefore necessary for the development of new and improved therapies for human heart diseases. The fruit fly heart serves as an efficient model system for elucidating the precise molecular basis of cardiac myocyte-nonmyocyte functional interactions. The fly heart is a linear tube comprising of cardiomyocytes (CMs) surrounded by nonmyocyte pericardial cells (PCs). Our recently published study showed that under normal, physiological conditions, levels of ROS are elevated in the PCs compared to the CMs. ROS in PCs activate a downstream D-p38 MAPK pathway that acts on the CMs to control their development and function. These findings provide new opportunities for us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ROS could mediate the functional interaction between PC and CM, which will contribute to the achieving of our central aim. Building on our published and new preliminary data, we will further delineate the components and function of the physiological ROS-D-p38 signaling pathway in the Drosophila PCs. Our central hypothesis is that a signaling pathway comprised of ROS-D-p38 (PC) ? Septate junction (SJ) proteins (PC) ? TRPA channels (CM) ? Ca2+ influx/signal transduction (CM) mediates the ROS-based paracrine interactions between PC and CM in the Drosophila heart. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: (1) Determine the intracellular source(s) of ROS in pericardial cells, (2) Define the roles of SJ proteins as pericardial cell-specific targets of ROS-D-p38 signaling, and (3) Define the roles of TRPA ion channel proteins as cardiomyocyte-specific targets of ROS-D-p38 signaling. These aims will be addressed by a combination of genetic, bio-imaging and RNA-sequencing experiments. This project is expected to reveal novel and important insights into the poorly understood areas of ROS-based paracrine signaling and functional interactions between cardiac myocytes and nonmyocytes. This knowledge may facilitate the development of new and improved therapies for human heart disease and failure."
"9178646","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical public health need for the development of anti-cancer chemotherapeutics which selectively target cancerous vs. non-cancerous tissues. The glycolysis enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) represents a novel and selective anti-cancer target since it is crucial in allowing cancers to maintain their highly-glycolytic metabolism (the Warburg effect), survive in hypoxic conditions, and maintain an acidic tumor microenvironment to help evade immune response. Interestingly, congenital absence or inhibition of LDH-A has minimal side effects in humans and other mammals, suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of LDH-A would have little or no on-target side effects. LDH-A overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis and survival in an array of human cancers, and emerging research presents compelling evidence for LDH-A inhibition as a tractable anti-cancer strategy. This proposal aims to biologically characterize a class of recently discovered N-hydroxyindole (NHI) class LDH-A inhibitors. The long-term goals of this research project are to advance these inhibitors into animal studies and eventually into the clinic and, in doing so, to contribute valuable knowledge to the field of cancer biology and metabolism. The objective of the Research Training Plan is to perform further biological characterization on three promising NHI-class LDH-A inhibitors - 1j, 4j, and glucose-4j - using an established sequence of in vitro and cell culture tests. The central hypotheses of the proposed research, which have been formulated based on a strong body of preliminary results, are 1) that 1j, with its free carboxylic acid, is a potent LDH-A inhibitor; 2) that while both 1j and 4j inhibit LDH-A in cancer cells, 4j is a more cell-permeable, methyl ester pro-drug that is cleaved to 1j intracellularly; 3) that glucose-4j is acting as a pro-drug cleaved to 1j by intracellular glucosidases; 4) that glucose-4j is entering cells through GLUT transporters; 5) that glucose-4j's enhanced cancer cell toxicity over 4j is due to its ability to be more readily imported into cancer cells; and 6) tat expression levels of various GLUT transporters and glucosidases will be predictive of the toxicity of glucose-4j to various cancer cell lines. This proposal has two specific aims: 1) to further assess and characterize 1j and 4j as LDH-A inhibitors using a battery of in vitro and cell culture studies, and 2) to assess the cellular entry, cleavage, and cancer cell toxicity profile of glucose-4j. These aims will detail how this proposal's hypotheses will be addressed using an array of techniques and assays in which the applicant is trained using equipment and resources readily available at the sponsoring institution. The proposed research is significant because it will greatly advance the development of this novel and drug-like class of LDH-A inhibitors, which have strong potential as drug candidates in the targeted and selective treatment of a wide array of cancers."
"9189295","The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly in the United States, affecting at least 8% of the population. The pathogenesis of the disease includes obesity and insulin resistance, but impairments in ?-cell secretory function and survival are critical for the development of hyperglycemia. The mechanisms underlying ?-cell dysfunction and death remain incompletely understood, and improving our knowledge of these is fundamental for the development of better therapies for this potentially debilitating disease.  The islet extracellular matrix (ECM), synthesized almost exclusively by the islet endothelial cell, is an important source of signals for the ? cell. The islet ECM component laminin normally enhances insulin release and ?-cell survival. My preliminary data in islet endothelial cells from animal models of type 2 diabetes show for the first time that laminin ?4 production is decreased. Additionally, culturing primary islet endothelial cells in high glucose also results in decreased laminin ?4 production. Knockdown of laminin ?4 in immortalized islet endothelial cells results in impaired insulin release, and insulin release is impaired in laminin ?4-knockout mice.  Thus, I hypothesize that increasing laminin ?4 production in islet endothelial-derived ECM will improve ?-cell function under hyperglycemic conditions. I will address this hypothesis by undertaking studies to determine if overexpression of laminin ?4 in primary islet endothelial cells cultured in high glucose is sufficient to improve ?-cell function in vitro. Critically, I will also determine if infection of islet endothelial cells with a long-term cell-specific AAV expression of laminin ?4 improves insulin release in vivo. I anticipate that these studies will demonstrate for the first time that increasing expression of laminin ?4 is sufficient to improve ?-cell function and survival under diabetic conditions.  This proposal outlines a comprehensive thirteen month plan focused on scientific and professional development. The proposed studies will expand our understanding of the islet endothelial cell's contribution to ?-cell function and survival, while facilitating my acquisition of scientific skills in islet biology, a new field for me. Dr. Hull's expertise in islet biology together with the exceptional mentoring environment provided by her and my co-sponsor Dr. Kahn, will contribute to the completion of this project, and to my career development. Participation in seminars, lab meetings, regional and national meetings, and events sponsored by the NIDDK- funded Diabetes Research Center (DRC) and Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) at the University of Washington will contribute to a rich training and career development experience. Together, these activities will enable me to successfully compete for a Career Development (K) Award and progress towards my goal of becoming an independent investigator in metabolism with a focus on islet biology."
"9103377","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating disease that is diagnosed in about 19,000 people per year, with a 5-year survival of only 24%. The mainstay of treatment is multi-agent chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, both associated with high morbidity and mortality, largely due to toxic effects on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). To enable the design of more specific treatments for AML, it is critical to identify therapeutic targets in leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), since this cell population is important in  relapse and resistance. PI3 kinase (PI3K) is a lipid and protein kinase that transduces growth factor and chemokine signals, leading to phosphorylation and activation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, which regulates metabolism, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and protein synthesis. Pathologic phosphorylation of Akt is frequently reported in AML patient samples, and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway has shown efficacy in AML cell lines, patient samples, and mouse leukemia models. This pathway is an attractive therapeutic target for leukemia and other malignancies. However, the role of PI3K signaling in normal adult HSCs is unclear. This is an important consideration for the potential toxicity of PI3K/Akt inhibitors in the clinic. In hematopoietic cels, genes encoding four different isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PI3K (p110 ??????? and ?) are expressed. These isoforms have unique functions in normal and cancer cells, but may substitute for each other in some contexts. Two classes of PI3K inhibitors are currently in clinical development: pan-PI3K inhibitors, which target all four PI3K isoforms, and isoform-selective inhibitors, which favor only one or two isoforms. To determine which of the PI3K isoforms are essential for hematopoiesis, and which are more important in leukemic cells, we have generated a series of mouse knockouts to study the roles of each isoform individually in adult HSCs. We recently found that RAS- mutated myeloid leukemias are dependent on the p110alpha isoform of PI3K, and that pharmacologic inhibition of p110alpha is effective in treatment of murine models of RAS-mutated leukemia. However, normal HSC functions are maintained in the absence of p110alpha, making it a safe therapeutic target. It is still not known whether PI3K is essential for adult HSC function, as other PI3K isoforms may compensate for p110alpha in HSCs. Furthermore, the role of PI3K in LICs is unclear. We have now generated novel compound knockout mouse models, which will enable the inducible conditional deletion of multiple PI3K isoforms in adult HSCs. In Specific Aim 1, we will further characterize the redundant roles of the PI3K isoforms in HSC function, self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. In Specific Aim 2, we will genetically ablate PI3K isoforms in mouse models of AML, in order to determine the roles of PI3K in LIC function. At the moment, criteria for the selection of AML patients that are most likely to respond to isoform-selective PI3K inhibitor treatment have not been established. To address this issue, in Specific Aim 3, we will delineate the molecular determinants for PI3K dependence and PI3K isoform specificity in AML."

Given its known health effects and ubiquitous nature in the environment and many occupational micro-environments, identification of a valid and reproducible biomarker of Mn exposure or disease has been of interest to the environmental health and neurological research communities. Existing Mn biomarker studies have not reached consensus on a valid and reproducible biomarker of Mn exposure or disease when looking for elemental Mn in common biological specimens (blood, plasma, urine, hair), which is why metabolomics methods are being explored. Metabolomics is the study of the small molecules in biological systems (<1000 Daltons), often important in metabolic function and signaling or representing a fingerprint of a specific cellular process. Global metabolomics methods apply mass spectrometry in an untargeted approach to detect the small molecules found in a biological sample, often identifying tens of thousands of unique ions found in each sample. These metabolomics profiles can be compared between groups defined by different environments in order to identify specific ions associated with a feature such as exposure. This proposal has two main objectives. The first is to explore the metabolomics profiles in whole blood, plasma, and urine, collected from Mn-exposed and Mn- unexposed shipyard workers, on whom a well-characterized exposure history has been collected. The second is to use mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance methods to identify (by chemical name or empirical formula) those metabolites that are found to be associated with exposure, determine the biological pathway those metabolites are in, and use this information to determine how this pathway is involved in the Mn exposure-disease relationship. This proposed work will directly help promote the NIEHS mission, by discovering how Mn in the environment affects people at the biochemical level, which in turn could be used to promote healthier lifestyles for those with high exposure to Mn. This work will be done in concert with a training plan that will include coursework in analysis of big data (such as metabolomics data), environmental exposure modeling and assessment, and the use of biological data in health-based studies. In addition to coursework, the fellowship will support one-on-one mentoring with experts in metabolomics analysis methods and ion identification techniques, and participation in relevant seminars such as the NIEHS Exposure Sciences and the Exposome Webinar, and University of Washington seminars on Environmental Health and Data Science topics."
"9226241","Hospital-acquired bacterial diseases represent a huge block in attempting to care for patients being treated for unrelated medical problems. Of particular concern are multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens in hospital settings. Acinetobacter baumannii is one such pathogen that has become exceedingly difficult to treat, with the organism having evolved resistance to most commonly used antibiotics during its residence in hospitals. Fluoroquinolones (FQ), which target DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, are chief among the antibiotics that have lost usefulness with this organism. The most common resistant A. baumannii strains in hospitals contain three genetic changes, two of which interfere with target binding to FQ, while the third results in overproduction of one of two antibiotic egress pumps. This proposal is directed toward developing new strategies for eliminating fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) strains. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that FQR creates points of vulnerability for the organism, and drug targets can be identified that take advantage of this potential Achilles' heel. The proposal seeks to identify drug targets in FQR strains by mapping genetic interactions that protect against stresses caused by the acquired resistance mutations.  The proposed studies focus on performing mutant hunts to identify proteins that are required for the survival of FQR bacteria or which, when inactivated, restore the therapeutic usefulness of FQs. The overall strategy involves setting up a bank of parent strains with various combinations of mutations that individually contribute to FQR. Each of these strains is subjected to high-density insertion mutagenesis followed by pooling and analysis by massively parallel sequencing. The fitness of insertions in the FQR backgrounds will be compared to the FQS parent, allowing identification of genes required for viability of each of the strains. Of particular interest in this regard are strains that encode antibiotic egress pumps. The potential for finding a single target that is necessary for survival of strains harboring either of the known pumps that contribute to FQR could allow disruption of a wide spectrum of drug resistant mutants. A similar approach will be taken to identify targets that restore the therapeutic usefulness of FQ. High-density insertion pools in each of the FQR strain backgrounds will be subjected to treatment with the FQ antibiotic ciprofloxacin, and mutants that have low fitness in the presence of the drug relative to the rest of the population will be identified. To demonstrate that the screens identified candidates that are true targets, deletion mutations will be constructed and their ability to reproduce the predicted growth defects will be tested. Long term, the targets identified in this approach will be used in chemical screens to identify novel classes of antimicrobials that target FQR A. baumannii, allowing treatment of drug resistant mutants in hospital settings."
"9025306","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. While obesity is a strong risk factor for certain types of cancer, such as colon, breast  and endometrial cancers, many epidemiological studies have consistently indicated an inverse association between body mass index (BMI) and risk of lung cancer after adjusting for other established risk factors. It is largely controversial whether the observed inverse association is due to the biological genuine effects of BMI or systematic biases. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an analytical approach that uses genetic variants as the instrumental variable (IV) to infer the causal relationship between an exposure variable and disease. However, because of the lack of efficient statistical tools, MR often requires an extremely large sample size to achiev adequate statistical power. In this proposed study, we will develop a novel statistical method that utilizes genome wide association study (GWAS) data to construct the IV for obesity traits in MR analysis. The major advantage of this approach is that it can unravel the missing heritability of obesity traits that is not accounted for by the known genetic variants, and thereby provide substantially improved statistical power. Because this study will utilize the existing individual GWAS data as well as detailed epidemiologic data from about 20,000 lung cancer cases and 20,000 controls in TRICL (Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung), it will be conducted in an extremely cost-efficient manner. This study will provide a unique opportunity to answer the longstanding question of whether there are causal effects of obesity traits on lung cancer risk, potentially to open new avenues for further studies in understanding the etiology of lung cancer, and to provide important statistical tools for facilitating investigation of the causa relationship between risk factors and diseases in general."
"9355372","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this K23 proposal is to support the early career development of Dr. Anne Fernandez, a clinical psychologist with specialized expertise in addiction and health psychology. This award will facilitate her program of research - evaluating and implementing screening, brief interventions, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol use disorders in novel medical settings. Her career goal is to improve patient health, enhance hospital outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs through carefully timed alcohol-use interventions. In this career development award (CDA), she will facilitate these career goals by developing expertise in four training areas: (1) multi-disciplinar health services research, (2) SBIRT implementation practices, (3) qualitative data collection and analysis, and (4) quantitative methods in medical research. She will acquire this training through expert mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on research. The research portion of this CDA is a randomized controlled trial that will pilot test SBIRT for risky alcohol use prior to elective surgery. This CDA builds on existing research indicating that moderate alcohol use (> 2 drinks/day) increases the risk of postoperative morbidity, while heavy alcohol use (> 4 drinks/day) increases the risk of postoperative mortality. These risk factors increase utilization f health care services, placing undue burden on patients, providers, and the healthcare system. To date, no randomized controlled trial has ever evaluated whether SBIRT can reduce alcohol use prior to elective surgery and improve postoperative health outcomes. This K23 will take the first steps in addressing this research gap. The three research aims are to: (1) assess the healthcare system to guide implementation of presurgical alcohol SBIRT, (2) to conduct an open trial of SBIRT in a presurgical clinic, and (3) to conduct a randomized pilot trial of alcohol SBIR prior to elective surgery. These research aims incorporate several novel components, including a mixed-method healthcare assessment and simultaneous evaluation of both efficacy and implementation outcomes. These steps will ensure the protocol addresses the needs of the larger healthcare system. Successful study completion will result in new information regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of SBIRT for risky drinking prior to surgery. This program of research and training will allow the candidate to initiate a career conducting patient-oriented research that will ultimately reduce problematic alcohol use, improve patient health, bolster hospital outcomes, and reduce the cost of postoperative care."
"9376740","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Because one in three school-aged children are overweight or obese, there is a need to develop and test school-based programming that aims to prevent progression and support remission of childhood obesity (secondary prevention). The proposed study will test a novel elementary school-based, school nurse- directed weight management program that aims to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity among 8 to 11 year old children. The 12-month, multi-component intervention for children who are overweight or at risk for overweight will include parents and will target key modifiable diet and activity factors known to be successful in changing long-term energy balance. The program will be offered as a second step of an established school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and parent notification program, held after school and include: 1) quarterly parent/child coaching sessions, 2) twice monthly child groups; 3) a once monthly parent group, and 4) collaboration with health care providers and community-based organizations. Study aims will be accomplished using a randomized controlled trial design, with random assignment of 175 2nd and 4th grade students plus one parent to intervention or attention-only control conditions.  The primary aim of this research is to reduce excessive weight gain among 8 to 11 year old children who are overweight or at risk of overweight by increasing healthy dietary practices and physical activity levels and decreasing sedentary practices. Secondary aims will examine the effect of the intervention on the dietary, physical activity and sedentary practices of children and on family lifestyle practices overseen by parents. Measures for children will include height and weight, dietary intake measured by 24-hour dietary recall, child activity levels measured by accelerometer, health-related quality of life and psychosocial factors. Parent measures will include height and weight, parental dietary and activity practices and psychosocial and environmental mediators at the family level. Process measures will assess program implementation and include measures of fidelity, dose, reach and context. Collaboration with key stakeholders representing school nursing practice, health insurers, health providers and community programming, as well as prospective economic analyses of intervention effectiveness will support translation of this work into sustainable school practice.  It is hypothesized that relative to the control condition, children receiving the intervention will have  significantly lower body mass index, following implementation of the 12-month intervention, controlling for baseline values."
"9278506","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Virus-receptor interactions are often mediated by multifunctional viral attachment proteins that bind receptors and guide post-attachment cell-entry events. Key gaps in knowledge about these molecules include mechanisms by which receptor binding facilitates viral tropism and the conformational changes that orchestrate multiple activities in a single protein. The proposed research uses reovirus, a genetically tractable dsRNA virus that shows promise for oncolytic and vaccine applications, to dissect the process of specific and successful viral receptor engagement. Experiments will be performed to determine the role of glycan binding in viral tropism, define functions of viral attachment protein subsequent to receptor recognition, and elucidate mechanisms by which different capsid components attach to unique receptors. Following primary infection in the murine intestine, reovirus disseminates to the central nervous system (CNS), where it exhibits serotype-specific differences in tropism. Reovirus attachment is initiated by low-affinity binding to sialylated glycans followed by high-affinity binding to either junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) or Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1). Reovirus serotype 1 (T1) and serotype 3 (T3) strains bind to JAM-A and NgR1, but they vary in glycan utilization. The ?1 fiber protein binds glycan and JAM-A, whereas the ?3 capsid-surface protein binds NgR1. Three integrated specific aims are proposed to enhance knowledge of reovirus attachment mechanisms. In Specific Aim 1, the contribution of glycan engagement to reovirus neural tropism will be determined. Minimal carbohydrate-binding regions of T1 and T3 ?1 proteins will be defined using chimeric viruses engineered by reverse genetics. Mice will be infected with chimeric viruses to elucidate how glycan-binding specificity targets reovirus to discrete CNS sites. The specific glycan bound by reovirus on neurons will be identified. In Specific Aim 2, post-attachment functions and associated conformational changes in ?1 will be defined by testing neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for different ?1 conformations for the capacity to block viral attachment, internalization, and disassembly. Crystal structures of ?1 in complex with mAbs that impede distinct steps in viral entry will be determined to establish a biophysical basis for mAb-mediated infection blockade and identify new ?1 functional domains. Viral entry steps requiring ?1 conformational mobility will be defined using viruses with engineered disulfide bridges to lock ?1 in different conformational states. In Specific Aim 3, the structural basis of reovirus interactions with NgR1 will be elucidated. Sequences in ?3 and NgR1 required for binding and infection will be defined. The structure of NgR1 in complex with ?3 will be determined using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. These studies will enhance an understanding of mechanisms by which viruses engage cellular receptors, contribute new information about multifunctional viral attachment proteins, and accelerate the rational design of viral vectors for clinical applications."
"9258925","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is among the deadliest cancers worldwide, with a five-year survival rate of ~30% in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and ~50% in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC). It is a rare cancer, affecting ~8,500 (5,500 ICC, 3000 ECC) patients in the U.S. each year. Often cancers develop from an imbalance between signals that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. While most advances in cancer therapy have been made by inhibition of cell proliferation, the re-establishment of cell differentiation has resulted in the cure of certain forms of leukemia. In this proposal, we will focus on the interaction between hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4?), the master regulator of hepatic differentiation, and the Wnt/?- catenin signaling pathway, which enhances cell proliferation. We will use zebrafish for our studies, which has advantages as a model organism because of in vivo imaging, time resolution, and chemical screening methods not available or feasible in rodent models. Importantly, zebrafish display disease morphology and pathophysiology that is similar to mammals. We hypothesize that an HNF4?/?-catenin interaction is important in hepatobiliary development playing an important role cell fate during both development and cholangiocarcinoma formation. Our first aim is to characterize and define the importance of HNF4?/?-catenin interaction in regard to hepatobiliary development. We have recently generated novel HNF4? knockout zebrafish and are in the process of generating a heat shock-inducible HNF4? over-expression zebrafish. These models will allow us to not only define the role of HNF4? in hepatobiliary development, but, in combination with genetic and pharmacologic models of Wnt/?-catenin modulation, will allow us to characterize an interaction between these two pathways. We will use these mutants and and chemical modulators to characterize liver growth, morphology, and physiology during hepatobiliary development and assess perturbations in normal hepatic and biliary cell fate. Our second aim is to determine a role for the HNF4?/?- catenin interaction in cholangiocarcinoma formation. We will first characterize tumor incidence, progression, and mortality in zebrafish with mutations resulting in dysregulation of the HNF4?/?-catenin pathway. Further, we will utilize both genetic and pharmacologic means to re-establish a normal HNF4?/?-catenin interaction and observe changes in tumor burden. These studies will not only reveal novel mechanisms of cholangiocarcinoma pathogenesis, but also will allow us to develop new targets for therapeutic development for this devastating disease."
"9257532","My PhD research is the identification and characterization of genes for inherited bone marrow failure and myelodysplastic syndromes (BMF/MDS). Since my previous F30 submission, I have identified two candidate genes for these conditions by genomic analysis of severely affected families. The aims of this new proposal are to test each gene as the possible cause of inherited BMF/MDS in its host family, then to evaluate the possible role of each gene in hematopoiesis. In Aim 1, I will test whether a missense mutation in GALE (UDP-galactose-4-epimerase) may be responsible for severe thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia in a large consanguineous kindred. In Aim 1a, I will screen for other mutations in GALE by fully sequencing the gene in DNA from unrelated patients from the BMF/MDS repositories. In Aim 1b, I will compare enzymatic activities of wildtype and mutant GALE by HPLC. I will also compare the crystal structures of wildtype and mutant GALE in complex with NADH and nucleotide sugars. In Aim 1c, I will suppress GALE in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and measure cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. I will also explore ER stress and other effects that may be mechanisms by which loss of GALE impairs hematopoietic development. In Aim 2, I will test whether a missense mutation in transcription factor TFDP2 (E2F Dimerization Partner-2) may be responsible for severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, and craniosynostosis in affected siblings in a consanguineous family. In Aim 2a, I will screen for other mutations in TFDP2 in DNA from patients from the BMF/MDS repositories and, independently, in patients with craniosynostosis. In Aim 2b, I will compare mutant and wildtype TFDP2 with respect to binding affinity to E2F partners and will compare effects of wildtype and mutant E2F/TFDP2 complexes on transcription activity of target genes. In Aim 2c, I will test the effects of suppression of TFDP2 on CD34+ cells, and test for defects in cell cycle transition and in DNA replication by comparing endoreduplication levels and BrdU incorporation. Elucidating roles for GALE and TFDP2 in hematopoiesis will add important knowledge to the field. Studying the role of GALE can help explain how changes in glycosylation affect hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation. E2F pathways are well-known in cell cycle regulation, but less so in development. Studying mutation in TFDP2 will improve our understanding of the role of E2F/TFDP transcription factor complexes in hematopoiesis and human development."
"9136712","DESCRIPTION :      Mentoring and Training Activities  The proposed CDA-2 is designed to promote Dr. Hall's transition to an independent Rehabilitation Research career under the mentorship of leading researchers in the areas of physical function, PTSD, and chronic disease management. The training plan for this CDA-2 includes a mix of didactic and experiential learning activities. The primary objectives of this training plan include: develop competency in cognitive- behavioral approaches to reducing PTSD symptoms; develop hands-on experience and utilize innovative mobile health technologies; develop expertise in physical activity interventions for Veterans with PTSD and the development of comparative effectiveness clinical trials; and continued professional development in the areas of manuscript preparation, grant proposals, and the responsible conduct of research.  There is substantial evidence that physical inactivity contributes to poorer physical health outcomes in older adults. There is a paucity of work examining physical activity in Veterans with PTSD. Consequently, the efficacy of exercise as a beneficial adjunctive therapy in the treatment for PTSD symptoms and related health sequelae has not been established. Methods: Eighty Veterans 60 years and older with PTSD will be recruited from the Durham VAMC PTSD clinic to participate in a 12-week physical activity program consisting of aerobic and strength-training activities. Participants will be randomized to an intervention arm or usual care. Outcomes: Changes in physical function, PTSD symptom severity, and aerobic endurance will be assessed between the two study arms. Secondary outcomes include compliance with the intervention, pain, sleep, and psychological well-being. Summary: This pilot trial will extend our understanding of the physical and psychological benefits of physical activity in Veterans with PTSD. The results from this study will be used to be  used to develop a larger, randomized controlled exercise trial for Veterans with PTSD. Once new, effective exercise therapies for Veterans with PTSD are established, we can augment traditional PTSD therapy with exercise therapy to promote the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases common in this vulnerable population."
"9323160","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K99/R00 grant will facilitate the applicant's (Dr. Nagaraj Kerur) long-term goal to develop as an independent investigator in vision research. Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) characterized by central loss of vision due to retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) degeneration. Currently there is no therapy available for GA because of its unclear etiology. We recently discovered that DICER1 deficit causes a pathologic accumulation of Alu RNA transcripts in the RPE of human GA eyes and that the accumulated Alu RNAs activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which in turn leads to IL- 18/MyD88-dependent RPE cell death (Kaneko et al., Nature 2011; Tarallo et al., Cell 2012). In exciting, new preliminary studies we have discovered that Alu RNA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurs in a non-canonical fashion- a newly described pathway in which caspase 4 (aka caspase 11 in mouse) is required for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (in contrast the canonical inflammasome activation is independent of caspase 4). The central goal of the proposed research is to define role of caspase 4-mediated non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the context of GA and to identify critical signaling pathways regulating caspase 4 activation via the following aims: (1) Define the signaling pathways that regulate caspase 4 (aka caspase 11 in mouse) activation by Alu RNA; (2) Elucidate the mechanisms of caspase 4 (aka caspase 11 in mouse) activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome; and (3) Measure the activation of these non-canonical inflammasome signaling pathways in human GA. These studies will illuminate the molecular foundation of GA, unravel novel regulatory checkpoints of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and provide a strong molecular foundation for exploiting new therapeutic targets in AMD. During the mentored phase, (K99) the applicant will carry out the proposed studies under direct supervision of the mentor Dr. Jayakrishna Ambati at the University of Kentucky. In addition, an advisory committee consisting of co-mentor, Dr. Katherine Fitzgerald and the faculty members at the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences will monitor the applicant's research progress and offer assistance in advancing the applicant's transition towards independent investigator. The Ambati Group at the University of Kentucky as well as the Fitzgerald Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, both offer scientifically enriching environments and resources necessary for the advancement of the applicant's scientific career. The major focus of K99 phase will include: (1) mentored research to define molecular insights into the caspase 4 activation mechanism and to optimize experimental conditions for studies to be carried out in the R00 phase; and (2) training activities consisting of formal course work, seminars, workshops on grant writing and acquisition of other skill-sets required for successfully developing and leading an independent research program. During the R00 phase, the focus will be on: (1) deciphering the mechanisms by which caspase 4 regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation; and (2) quantifying the activation of non-canonical inflammasome signaling pathways in human GA eyes. Overall this proposal will not only unravel the novel molecular mechanisms of RPE degeneration in GA, but will also equip the applicant with suitable skills to transition int an independent career in vision research."

"9188778","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The overall goal of this three-year project is to maximize the functional recovery of patients with  above elbow amputations (AEA) by developing an intramedullary Percutaneous Osseointegrated Docking System (PODS) that is ready for translation to human clinical trials. The design of the AEA PODS will address the challenges found in above elbow residual limbs of modern day warfighters (i.e. short residual limbs, heterotopic ossification (HO), shrapnel). Background: Socket-type attachment of an exoprosthesis to the residual limb is currently the standard of care, but is not suitable for all patients. Even patients successfully fitted with sockt-type attachments can be dissatisfied since they frequently experience pain from persistent deterioration of the soft tissues resulting from poor socket fit. In addition, blast related heterotopic ossification (HO) within the soft tissues of the residual limb cause further reductions  in quality of life. It is for these kinds of patients that PODS devices are developed. There are three Specific Aims to this proposal. First, using morphological data from a pooled cadaver population with the diversity of personnel currently serving active duty for the United States, we will engineer a series of AEA PODS endoprostheses. We have a proven track record with this type of work not only with translational animal models, but also with human femurs for an upcoming FDA small feasibility clinical trial with AKA patients. In this project, we will deliver a  series of AEA PODS sufficient to achieve a 95% confidence of fitting the pooled cadaver population. Second, we will verify the endoprosthetic fit of the AEA PODS using a sample population of de-identified VA and military patients with traumatic amputations. To date, PODS have not been designed to account for the unique clinical challenges found in both the VA and the military healthcare populations. Working directly with collaborators within the VA, the WRNMMC, and the BAMC healthcare systems, we will obtain de-identified CT image sets from trauma related AEA populations. By evaluating the designed AEA PODS using a sample patient population, we will be able to verify that the designs are adequate to preserve endoprosthetic fit of this unique population. We will deliver a series of AEA PODS sufficient to achieve a 95% confidence of fitting a sample patient population. Third, we will establish the initial post-operatve fixation expectations for AEA PODS. We believe that before rehabilitation of AEA PODS patients can safely be initiated, it is imperative to determine the relationship between the measured endoprosthetic fit of the AEA PODS endoprostheses and the expected post-operative fixation. We will deliver a mathematical relationship to estimate, within 95% confidence, the initial post-operative fixation of AEA PODS given the endoprosthetic fit. Study Design: Using our established protocols used to develop endoprosthesis for previous sheep animal models and upcoming FDA Feasibility trials for AKA PODS devices, we will engineer a series of AEA PODS sufficient to achieve a 95% confidence of fitting a sample AEA patient population and develop a mathematical relationship to estimate, within 95% confidence, the initial post-operative fixation of AEA PODS given the endoprosthetic fit. Relevance: In the development of PODS devices, patients with traumatic amputations above the elbow are currently underserved. As of 02 July 2012, the number of patients from OIF/OEF with major limb amputations has reached 1,506, of which 263 (17%) suffer from upper extremity involvement. Nationally, it is estimated in 2005, of the 1.5 million persons living with limb loss in 2005, 541,000 (36%) have an upper extremity involvement. Unfortunately, rejection of socket-type exoprosthetics is especially prevalent in AEA patients. Nearly 60% of AEA patients reject the use of their socket-based exoprosthesis because of issues such as poor fit, difficulties with training, limited usefulness, and short residual limb-length."
"9186527","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States largely due to patients being diagnosed at late stages when metastasis has already occurred. A major mechanism of cancer metastasis is a process known as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During EMT, epithelial cells of the primary tumor undergo genetic and epigenetic alterations that allow them to change their morphology from a polarized and anchored cell to an invasive mesenchymal cell. EMT markers include the loss of E-cadherin and gain of N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin expression. Vimentin is a classical EMT marker that historically correlates with metastasis and poor overall survival across multiple tumor types; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which vimentin expression triggers cell motility and invasion. Our lab has demonstrated that vimentin regulates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to stabilize focal adhesions essential for motility. This is important since it provides a functional role for vimentin to control cell motility and adhesion. Moreover, previous work shows that vimentin morphology and dynamics are mediated by serine phosphorylation in its head domain. Therefore, we will test the central hypothesis that serine phosphorylation events mediate vimentin dynamics to control focal adhesion activity and, therefore, cancer cell invasion and metastasis. To test this, we will determine 1) the mechanism by which serine phosphorylation in the vimentin head domain mediates its dynamics and function in cell adhesion and 2) the in vivo metastatic phenotypes driven by these vimentin phosphorylation events. This approach will allow us to combine in vitro experiments using innovative 3-D multicellular lung spheroid models along with in vivo xenografts. Furthermore, we will incorporate cutting- edge multi-photon imaging of lung explants to visualize the impact of vimentin expression on real-time metastasis. Our overarching goal is to use this information to decipher vimentin function in invasive lung cancer and thereby probe the molecular basis of lung cancer EMT."

He joined faculty as a physician-scientist in July 2014 with plans to pursue a career studying the pharmacogenomics of cardiac arrhythmias. Dr. Shoemaker's shortterm goal is to understand the electrophysiologic (EP) mechanisms by which common genetic variants lead to atrial fibrillation (AF) and modulate clinical response to AF therapies. During the five years of this career development award, he plans to strengthen his understanding of clinical pharmacology and drug science, genetics, methods for quantitative trait analysis, and clinical trial design. Dr. Shoemaker's long-term goal is to establish a researc program focused on the development of personalized and pharmacogenomics-based approaches to AF therapy. The goal of his career development plan and complementary research proposal is to develop the skills and generate preliminary data to successfully compete for independent funding through R01 grant mechanisms.          Environment: As both the coordinating center of the NIH's Clinical and Translational Science Award   (CTSA) program, and lead site for the Pharmacogenomics of Arrhythmia Therapy (PAT) node of the Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN), Vanderbilt University is ideally suited to provide Dr. Shoemaker cross-training in clinical investigation and pharmacogenomics research methods. He has a well established mentorship team with combined expertise in the genetics of arrhythmias, pharmacogenomics, and clinical trial design and implementation. Dr. Dawood Darbar is a clinical electrophysiologist and established physician-scientist with national leadership recognition in the human genetics of AF, and Director of  the Vanderbilt Arrhythmia Service. Dr. C. Michael Stein is a clinical trialist with expertise in cardiovascular pharmacogenomics and previously Assistant Dean for Clinical and Translational Research Scientist Development. Dr. Roden is Assistant Vice Chancellor for Personalized Medicine and serves as Principal Investigator for several large federally-funded projects focused on implementation of pharmacogenomics including the PAT node of the PGRN. All three mentors are committed to Dr. Shoemaker's career development and have a track record of successfully mentoring young investigators.          Research: We propose two Specific Aims that seek to define the EP mechanism(s) by which common genetic variants at the chromosome 4q25 locus contribute to AF susceptibility and modulate response to AF therapies. Phenotyping will be performed using standardized collection of intracardiac EP measurements in patients with AF undergoing ablation. The Specific Aims focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at chromosome 4q25 that were identified by GWAS to be strongly associated with AF. They are suspected to be transcriptional regulators of a nearby gene, PITX2 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2), which in transgenic mice has been found to regulate development of the pulmonary vein (PV) myocardial sleeve - a critical structure in AF pathogenesis, and result in pro-arrhythmic changes in atrial electrophysiology through adverse electrical and structural remodeling. While we have demonstrated that AF risk alleles at 4q25 predict an impaired clinical response to treatment with AF ablation and modulate response to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), the underlying mechanism(s) for these observations remains unknown. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to further our understanding of the effect of 4q25 risk allele carriers on PV myocardial sleeve size and changes in atrial refractoriness. These findings will not only advance our understanding of how 4q25 risk allele carriers respond to isolation of the PV myocardial sleeves (ablation) but also to specific AAD therapies, which mediate their effect by slowing either atrial repolarization or conduction velocity. In Specific Aim 2 we focus specifically on AF ablation by testing the hypothesis that 4q25 risk allele carriers who undergo AF ablation are more likely to have recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythias due to non-PV mediated AF sources. This finding would inform trials testing personalized AF ablation strategies based on 4q25 genotype. These Aims are designed to provide preliminary data for Dr. Shoemaker to propose future clinical trials investigating both personalization of AF ablation therapy and a pharmacogenomics-based approach to AAD therapy for this common and morbid condition."
"9222500","PROJECT SUMMARY Bacterial infections following childbirth, so-called puerperal infections, cause morbidity in 5 to 10% of all pregnant women globally. In most instances the infection is limited to the reproductive tract but at low frequency the infection spreads to the blood resulting in life-threatening sepsis, puerperal sepsis. Pathogens causing puerperal sepsis include the group A Streptococcus (GAS, S. pyogenes), which is the most common cause of severe maternal puerperal infections and death worldwide. GAS epidemiological data gained over the course of the last fifty years identifies a serotype-specific variability in the ability of GAS to cause disease. Of relevance to this proposal, serotype M28 GAS isolates are non-randomly associated with cases of puerperal sepsis. The molecular basis of why serotype M28 isolates cause puerperal sepsis at a significantly higher rate relative to those of other serotypes is to be investigated in this proposal. More specifically, the goal of the proposed research is to characterize whether the presence of a genomic island, termed `region of difference 2' (RD2), is key to the enhanced ability of serotype M28 GAS to cause puerperal sepsis. Sequence analysis of RD2 is consistent with this element being horizontally transferred into M28 GAS from group B Streptococci (GBS, S. agalactiae), an important finding given that GBS are a common constituent of the normal vaginal microflora and are also a major cause of neonatal invasive infections. Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that RD2 enhances the ability of serotype M28 GAS isolates to both colonize the female reproductive tract and cause sepsis. To facilitate testing our hypothesis we recently constructed RD2 deletion mutant and complemented mutant derivatives of a representative M28 isolate. The parental, mutant, and complemented strains will be compared in tissue culture adherence assays, in growth assays using whole human blood (as a model of sepsis), and in a mouse model of vaginal colonization. Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the RD2 element alters the abundance of transcripts of core chromosomally-encoded virulence factors. Five putative transcription factors and two putative small regulatory RNAs are encoded within RD2. To test whether these putative regulators have targets outside of the RD2 region we will perform transcriptome comparisons between our parental and RD2 deletion mutant strains (via RNAseq). Comparisons will be performed following GAS growth in an ex vivo model of invasive infection. RNAseq data will be verified by targeted quantitative RT-PCR and Western analyses. Completion of the proposed research will advance our understanding of strain emergence and phenotypic heterogeneity in a prevalent Gram-positive pathogen. Specifically, the data would inform on the importance of RD2 with respect to the association of M28 GAS isolates with puerperal sepsis, and thereby provide a link between GAS gene content and clinical observations."
"9244219","  During the last 3 centuries and before, Vibrio cholerae (Vc), a Gram negative bacterium has plagued humans, causing 7 pandemics of the disease, cholera. Cholera in both epidemic and endemic form, features intracta- ble diarrhea and high mortality if not treated. Endemic cholera in Africa and the Haiti epidemic underscore the unresolved issue of how to control cholera. One short term cholera control approach is a universal vaccine. The main challenge of a universal cholera vaccine is to provide immunity quickly to the most susceptible co- hort: young children (2-5 years old). The consensus is that the current oral cholera vaccine (OCV) with its 42% protective efficacy for young children does not accomplish this. We will expand and improve our experimental conjugate cholera vaccine by introducing a new clinically relevant carrier. The current BSA carrier is not ap- propriate for human vaccines. The conjugates we developed contain a highly immunogenic form of acid- detoxified Inaba LPS (pmLPS) that induces vibriocidal titers with one dose and highly protective Ab with a sec- ond. We need to optimize the pmLPS conjugate to reach our goal of a one dose cholera vaccine for young children. Individual Vc flagellar proteins (FlaPr) will serve as carriers. Synthesis of existing data in the cholera literature suggest a hypothesis: a purified, recombinant, Vc FlaPr will induce protective antibodies (Abs) and also serve as a TLR5 agonists required for optimal Ab induction. The literature indicates the two pro- tective Ag in pm-LPS-FlaPr conjugates will prompt synergistic Ab effects thus providing the final component of a one dose, pediatric cholera vaccine. Following oral or intranasal administration, FlaPr-based vaccine and a killed, whole-cell Vc vaccine will be compared for immunogenicity, induction of protective immunity, and B cell memory. Adult mice will serve for initial immunogenicity studies but in select studies, the vaccine response of neonatal mice will be compared to adults. Like young children, neonatal mice immunized with native LPS are poor repsonders. We propose to overcome this defect by using a conjugate vaccine that preferentially target neonatal follicular B cells rather than marginal zone B cells that mainly make anti-LPS IgM Abs. The redirected response should enhance class switching and induce LPS-specific memory B cells. In our studies, if adult and neonatal mice produce similar Ab responses to the conjugates, but only adults respond to the LPS, it would supply a critical piece of evidence showing the value of the conjugates and the utility of the neonatal mouse model. The use of pmLPS-FlaPr conjugates to overcome non-responsiveness to LPS epitopes in neonatal mice is decidedly novel for cholera vaccine research. In the clinic, capsular polysaccharides are the typical pro- tective epitopes of the conjugate vaccine that are used extensively for childhood vaccination (e.g., pneumo- coccal). Capsular conjugate vaccines are so effective they have reconfigured the circulating serotypes of childhood pathogens. pmLPS-conjugates could have the same effect."
"9198378","ABSTRACT The worsening epidemic of food allergy has been attributed to a confluence of environmental factors reflective of a modern life style, including altered gut microbiota, acting upon genetically susceptible individuals. Central to the development of food allergy is the breakdown of oral tolerance, normally enforced by food allergen- specific T regulatory (TR) cells. However, the mechanisms involved in the breakdown of oral tolerance are obscure. By employing an innovative murine model of human food allergy involving a gain of function mutation in the IL-4 receptor alpha chain immunotyrosine inhibitory motif (Il4raF709), we have demonstrated that food allergy is associated with reduced formation of allergen-specific induced TR (iTR) cells. Those iTR cells that are generated are dysfunctional and fail to prevent sensitization or to suppress active disease. This failure is related to their reprogramming into Th2-cell like TR cells that express IL-4, elevated levels of GATA3 and decreased Tgfb1 transcripts. We have also observed Th2 cell-like reprogramming in allergen-specific TR cells of human food allergic subjects. Food allergic Il4raF709 mice manifest dysregulation of innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2s), which play a requisite role in disease pathogenesis by secreting IL-4. They also exhibit dysbiotic commensal flora that are pathogenic, as evidenced by their promotion of food allergy when transferred into germ-free (GF) mice. Reciprocally, flora of food tolerant mice prevented disease induction when transplanted into GF Il4raF709 mice. Therapy with minimal Clostridia or Bacteroidetes consortia protect against food allergy. Accordingly, in Aim 1, we propose that Th2 cell-like TR cells play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and persistence by directing IgE production and mast cell expansion, and that suppression of the Th2 cell-like TR cell program by TR cell-specific Il4/Il13 deletion rescues established disease. We will also examine the contribution of altered Tgfb1 expression in TR cells to disease pathogenesis in mice with TR cell- specific Tgfb1 deletion or transgene expression. In Aim 2, We will test the hypothesis that IL-4 production by ILC2 plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis by suppressing iTR cell formation and inducing Th2 cell-like reprogramming of TR cells, and that TR cells in turn regulate ILC by IL-33-dependent mechanisms. Finally, in Aim 3, we hypothesize that a minimal set of Clostridia and Bacteroidetes consortia rescues active disease, suppresses dysbiosis and restores commensalism in part by signaling via MyD88 in TR cells, which would promote iTR cell formation and redirect intestinal immunoglobulin production away from IgE and towards IgA. Our proposed studies will identify fundamental immunological and microbial mechanisms by which oral tolerance is subverted in food allergy, and will enable the development of curative therapies."
"9173464","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The circulatory system consists of endothelial cell-lined blood vessels that serve as a transport network for red blood cells, which carry oxygen, immune cells, and hormones of the endocrine system. In parallel, the lymphatic system comprises blind-ended vessels, which are similarly lined by endothelial cells and are closely associated with the blood vessels of the circulatory system. Lymphatic vessels collect and return interstitial fluid to the circulatory system, are a site of lymphoid cell development and transit, and are required for lipid absorption in the digestive system. In both systems, the primary cell type that initiates formation and mediates function is the endothelial cell. Interestingly, lymphatic endothelial cells derive from venous endothelial cells during embryonic development indicating a common origin for both vessel types. Not surprisingly, a number of signaling molecules are shared and required for the formation of the circulatory and lymphatic systems. Among these is Flt4, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells that binds the ligand vascular endothelial growth factor c (Vegfc). Loss of Flt4 function in mouse or zebrafish embryos leads to a range of defects in veins, angiogenic blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels. This diverse requirement for Flt4 is governed, in part, by its highly dynamic expression during embryonic development. However, little is known about upstream regulators responsible for dynamic expression. An additional aspect of the dynamic role of Flt4 is its ability to activate a wide range of downstream signaling effectors in endothelial cells. Studies in primary cell lines and in vivo suggest that distinct downstream effectors may play context dependent roles during embryonic vascular and lymphatic development. Given the importance of new blood and lymphatic vessel growth in both human development and pathological settings, a better understanding of how Flt4 signals is highly relevant. In this application we will rely on our expertise using the zebrafish as a model to address these issues. In Aim 1, we will determine what controls dynamic expression of flt4. In particular, we will investigate the role of ERK and Ets transcription factors in directly activatin enhancers at the flt4 locus to induce tip cell expression. This will be achieved through application of transgenic and knockout zebrafish lines. In Aim 2, we will determine which Flt4-proximal signaling outputs are essential for vascular and lymphatic development. This will be done through application of site-specific nucleases to generate zebrafish lines bearing targeted deletion of tyrosines in the Flt4 cytoplasmic domain. Analysis of these lines will allow us to determine the importance of different downstream effectors in mediating context-dependent roles of Flt4."
"9388967","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Suprasacral spinal cord injury (SCI) often results in paraplegia (~45-50%). A great deal of research has been devoted to enabling walking in paraplegics. In addition to limited mobility and the sequelae of maladies that derive from it, pelvic visceral dysfunction following suprasacral SCI adds dramatically to both the morbidity and mortality of SCI survivors. Aberrant reflexes develop following initial spinal shock from organs distal to the injury; not only are excitatory reflex pathways exaggerated (i.e. hyper-reflexic), they are also indiscriminate (so- called mass reflexes). In fact, anything innervated by spinal motor neurons distal to the spinal cord lesion usually becomes hyper-reflexic following initial spinal shock due to both lack of descending inhibition and sprouting of uninhibited afferent nerves. These mass reflexes emerge and result in reflex pathways that were once inhibitory becoming excitatory, such as is the case in suprasacral SCI wherein noxious stimulation of the perineum inhibits bladder activity normally, but stimulates it after injury. Moreover, the emergence of entirely novel reflexes may occur distal to any SCI (e.g. interlimb reflexes in cervical SCI14 and bladder-to-hind limb locomotor reflexes in suprasacral SCI).  The emergence of a bladder-to-hind limb locomotor reflex is the observation that forms the basis of this proposal. It can be readily observed during cystometric evaluation in animals that minimally void by this mechanism (rat type 2 pattern) following suprasacral SCI, as well as during high pressure non-voiding contractions, and during routine external crede as part of daily post-SCI care. This apparently intravesical pressure-driven vesicosomatic reflex, an aberrant reflex pathway that develops following suprasacral SCI, may be utilized in order to facilitate walking in these animals. The overarching hypothesis is that neurostimulation of sacral visceral afferents, delivered as a surrogate stimulus for intravesical high pressure events, will facilitate hind limb locomotor activity in suprasacral SCI rats. We will utilize chronic SCI rats with known urinary bladder hyper-reflexia to selectively activate hind lim locomotor activity using our method of sacral neurostimulation (SNS) in combination with our model of SCI to demonstrate the utility of this approach. The long term goals of this project are to utilize this aberrant reflex pathway to facilitate walking training and augment walking capability in paraplegic patients by developing and applying appropriate neuromodulatory strategies directed toward utilization of this reflex therapeutically."
"9352443","Summary Geographic atrophy (GA) is an untreatable advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that is characterized by degeneration of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Neither the mechanisms that promote this RPE degeneration nor the basis for the centrifugal expansion of GA that can ultimately lead to blindness have been resolved. This enigmatic nature of GA pathogenesis has precluded the development of any FDA-approved therapy for the one million Americans diagnosed with GA and the millions more at risk of developing GA. In new and exciting studies, we made the surprising observation that there is an abundance of Alu repetitive RNA in the RPE of human eyes with GA that accumulates in response to a dramatic deficiency in the RNase DICER1 and induces RPE degeneration (Kaneko et al. Nature 2011). Our findings, which introduce a novel cell survival function for DICER1 independent of its canonical miRNA biogenesis function and the concept that Alu RNA can directly promote human pathology, provide new mechanistic insights into GA pathogenesis. However, we still lack an integrated understanding of how DICER1 is dysregulated in GA and precisely how Alu RNA induces RPE degeneration. A rigorous definition of these mechanisms is crucial to enhancing our understanding of the molecular drivers of GA and to developing rational treatments. We will provide novel functional insights into how DICER1/Alu RNA dysregulation contributes to GA pathogenesis and develop a novel therapeutic strategy via the following Aims: (1) Generate a spatiotemporal map of DICER1 and Alu RNA in relation to the locus of pathology in GA and early AMD eyes; (2) Decipher the mechanisms by which Alu RNA triggers a new inflammatory cell death pathway we have identified; (3) Define the molecular regulation of DICER1 in the RPE in the context of GA and the function of a novel DICER1 splice variant; (4) Create a new animal model of GA having human-like features of the disease and validate an antisense therapeutic strategy targeting Alu RNA. These studies will illuminate novel aspects of the molecular and biochemical bases of GA, and help validate a molecular targeting strategy that could be translated into clinical trials. As such, this proposal is perfectly aligned with the 5-year goals of the NEI's Retinal Diseases Program strategic plan."
"9192024","PROJECT ABSTRACT: The overall goal of this project is to evaluate novel strategies for identifying genetic variation that contributes to common, complex diseases, with a specific focus on variants that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk through parent of origin effects. CVD is the leading cause of death among men and women, and while genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified some genetic loci that contribute to CVD risk, a lot still remains unknown. The risk alleles identified by GWAS explain little of the heritability of the trait and some of this ?missing heritability? has been attributed to parent of origin effects. I propose to bridge this gap of knowledge by characterizing parent of origin effects on gene expression and on CVD associated phenotypes and calculate parent of origin heritability for CVD phenotypes in the Hutterites. The Hutterites are a founder population of European descent and our group studies a group of ~1400 individuals who descend from 64 founders and are related to each other in a 13 generation pedigree. The Hutterites live communally in the northern plains states and western Canada. With an extended and well recorded pedigree and technological advances in sequencing, we can impute Hutterite genotypes with high accuracy and identify the parent of origin of alleles from 98 Hutterite whole genome sequences to the remaining >1400 individuals in our sample. In addition to gene expression in LCLs and whole blood, we recorded CVD-association phenotypes for a subset of this sample that include measurements of lipids (LDL-c, HDL-c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and Lp(a)), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), carotid artery media thickness (CIMT), and echocardiographic traits (left ventricular mass, left atrial volume, among many others), as well as inflammatory cell counts. With this unique population resource, we can disentangle the contribution of maternally inherited alleles and paternally inherited alleles to CVD-associated phenotypes and ultimately to risk for cardiovascular disease."

"9173466","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease with rising prevalence and a high mortality rate. Current treatment is limited to open or endovascular surgery, a procedure for which only 10% of AAA patients are eligible, highlighting an urgent need for new mechanistic understandings of AAA. With a long term goal to identify new therapeutic targets for AAA, the current proposal will investigate the pathological roles of aldosterone (Aldo), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and high salt intake in AAA. Elevated plasma Aldo and high salt intake have been linked to a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. MR antagonists have been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. However, little is known of the roles of Aldo, MR, and high sal intake in AAA. Recently, the applicants discovered that administration of MR agonists, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) or Aldo to C57BL/6 male mice induced AAA in the presence of high salt. Importantly, DOCA- or Aldo-salt-induced AAA mimicked human AAA with respect to oxidative stress, vascular inflammation, smooth muscle cell (SMC) degeneration, metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, and elastin degradation. Treatment of mice with spironolactone or eplerenone, two clinically used MR antagonists, effectively attenuated DOC- or Aldo-salt-induced aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. Building on these exciting and novel findings, the applicants further demonstrated that, in isolated mouse aorta, administration of pathological plasma concentrations of Aldo and sodium activated MMP2 and induced oxidative stress, suggesting a direct pathological effect of Aldo and salt on aorta. Interestingly, denuding endothelial cells from isolated aorta had no effect on Aldo-salt-induced MMP2 activation and oxidative stress, indicating that MR in SMC (SMC-MR) is involved. Consistent with this concept, the applicants found that p47phox, a component of NADPH oxidase that has been implicated in human AAA, was markedly upregulated by Aldo-salt in the medial layer of abdominal aortic wall and co-localized with SMC a-Actin, which was completely abolished by treatment of mice with eplerenone. Moreover, treatment of mice with temporal, a free radical scavenger, diminished DOCA-salt-induced AAA. Therefore, the applicants hypothesize that increased plasma Aldo and salt activate SMC-MR and p47phox and thus result in oxidative stress, MMP activation, vascular inflammation, SMC degeneration, and elastin degradation, thereby contributing to AAA. Three specific aims are: 1) test the hypothesis that SMC-MR is required for Aldo-salt-induced AAA; 2) define the mechanism by which SMC-MR targets p47phox to induce AAA; 3) determine whether targeting the Aldo/MR/salt axis is effective for treatment of AAA. To achieve these aims, genetic animal models (SMC- specific MR knockout mice and global p47phox knockout mice) and various molecular, biochemical, and physiopathological approaches will be used. If proposed studies are successful, they will have a profound impact on current basic researches and clinical practices on the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AAA."
"9173040","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified a region of chromosome 9p21 as the most important source of heritable cardiovascular risk. This locus is independent of traditional risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, suggesting it potentiates disease via a novel mechanism. The most predictive 9p21 variants account for more than 20% of an individual's lifetime risk for coronary artery disease. Despite being implicated in the leading cause of death in the Western world, the mechanism(s) by which these polymorphisms lead to vascular disease remain unclear.  In this proposal, the investigators seek to elucidate the relationship between a leading candidate gene at the 9p21 risk locus, CDKN2B, and vascular disease. Specifically, they will query the role of this gene in angiogenesis, and the concept that CDKN2B may regulate disease via a paradoxical and antagonistic effect on blood vessel sprouting, and blood vessel maturation. This proposal will bring together recognized experts from several fields, deeply phenotyped human tissue samples and unique mouse models with the objective of fully describing the vascular biology of CDKN2B. This application includes three specific aims which will: 1) Map the molecular mechanism by which CDKN2B regulates blood vessel stabilization; 2) Employ novel cell-specific Cdkn2b knockout animals to specifically determine which cell type regulates the pathologic response to ischemia, and whether the process is reversible; and 3) Determine whether the angiogenic defect also promotes atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and myocardial infarction in human carriers of the 9p21 risk allele. The objective of these studies is to 'reverse translate' the biology of the 9p21 locus and contribute to the field of cardiovascular genetics in the post-GWAS era. Discoveries made in the course of this proposal are intended to support the stated mission of the National Institutes of Health and provide contributions that will lead to the development of new translational therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease."
"9237527","PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis is common, has a high mortality rate, and is a very resource-intensive healthcare problem in the U.S.A. Sepsis is associated with cytokine storm, an exacerbated immune response, resulting in excessive vasodilation and severe vascular leakage leading to circulatory shock and multiple organ failure. As sepsis persists, patients often develop features of immunoparalysis. The majority of shock-related deaths occur during this secondary hypo-immune state, likely due to the failure to clear the initial infection and/or secondary nosocomial infection despite antibiotic treatment. We have found that mice deficient in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (Mkp)-1, an inducible negative regulator of the p38 and JNK MAPKs, exhibit exacerbated inflammation following bacterial infections. These mice experienced a substantially enhanced cytokine storm and showed markedly increased mortality associated with vascular leak and circulatory collapse. Given the enhanced inflammatory response, paradoxically, Mkp-1-/- mice exhibited defective bacterial clearance. This picture of an augmented inflammatory response, and yet an inability to clear bacteria, mimics what is often seen in septic patients that go on to develop shock and multi-organ failure. However, the mechanisms leading to the impaired bactericidal activity in Mkp-1-/- mice are not known. Additionally, using bone marrow reconstituted mice, we found that Mkp-1 in cells of non-bone marrow origin (such as endothelial cells) plays a pivotal role in maintaining vascular barrier function. Our central hypothesis is that adequately enhancing Mkp-1 expression may dampen inflammation, enhance anti-bacterial immune defense, and improve barrier function, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients with sepsis. Although Mkp-1 is critically important in the innate immune response, its regulation remains poorly understood. In preliminary studies we found that mutation of two serine residues at the C-terminus of Mkp-1, which mimics phosphorylation by ERK, increased Mkp-1 stability 20-fold without affecting Mkp-1 ubiquitination. Computer-based analysis suggests that the C-terminus of Mkp-1, adjacent to these two serine residues, contains an intrinsically disordered domain and that phosphorylation of these two serine residues decreases the disorder of this domain. This suggests that the ERK pathway stabilizes Mkp-1 via increasing the order of an intrinsic disorderd domain. Therefore, we propose to elucidate the function of Mkp-1 in phagocytes and endothelial cells and to define the mechanism by which ERK stabilizes the Mkp-1 protein. We will also determine if enhancing ERK activity can be an effective strategy for sustaining Mkp-1 expression, thereby preventing the second phase of p38 activation, ultimately inhibiting cytokine production. The objective of this application is to understand the function and regulation of Mkp-1 in phagocytes and endothelial cells during bacterial sepsis and determine if selective ERK activation can be an effective means to attenuate inflammation."

"9176031","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microvascular disease associated with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease is becoming increasingly common in the aging population of the Western world. Remodeling and loss of micro vessels (MV) distal to renal arterial obstruction leads to irreversible injury, which is magnified by coexistence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, no effective clinically applicable strategies are currently available that are capable of improving MV structure and function and restoring renal viability. Low-energy shock wave therapy (SWT) is a novel non-invasive experimental strategy, which elicits biological responses in the cardiovascular system, including stimulation of endogenous reparative capacity and formation of new MV. In rodent models SWT can enhance recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to sites of hind-limb ischemia. Yet, the potential of this novel therapeutic platform t improve MV viability in renovascular diseased (RVD) associated with MetS has not been investigated. We have developed and characterized novel swine models of RVD and MetS that allow translational studies highly relevant to clinical medicine, as well as unique imaging techniques ideally suited for probing MV injury and viability. We have also shown the efficacy of using autologous EPC delivered into a stenotic renal artery to improve distal function. These tools now afford an opportunity to test the ability of SWT to enhance renal MV function and structure in RVD and promote recruitment of EPC to improve MV regeneration. The working hypothesis underlying this proposal is that SWT in RVD/MetS decreases injury, improves MV viability, and promotes recruitment of circulating EPC in the post-stenotic kidney. To test this hypothesis, we will study the effects of SWT using cutting-edge multi-detector CT (MDCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and micro-CT tools. Furthermore, the ability of SWT to improve renal recovery prospects will be tested in PVD pigs undergoing revascularization and stenting. Three specific aims will be pursued: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that SWT activates mechano- transduction signaling and improves renal MV density and function in RVD associated with MetS. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that this tactic would boost kidney MV viability after revascularization of RVD/MetS. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that SWT promotes recruitment and local retention of endogenous and exogenous EPC, respectively, in the post-stenotic kidney. Noninvasive improvement of the MV network using SWT is a promising, cutting edge technique, which will likely contribute significantly towards management of MV disease. The proposed studies may have broad ramifications and establish this novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy for RVD, MetS, and hypertension."
"9381011","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conventional and non-conventional T cells develop in the thymus. Non-conventional T cells that have features typically associated with innate immune cells are termed innate-like lymphocytes (ILLs). We and others have described a population of CD8+ ILLs, characterized by expression of the activation/memory markers CD44 and CD122, expression of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) and ability to produce IFN? rapidly after ex vivo stimulation. These CD8+ ILLs develop via a cell-extrinsic mechanism mediated by IL-4 production from a population of thymocytes that express promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), a known transcriptional regulator of innate cells. This proposal describes a 5-year career development plan and research strategy to develop an independent career as a laboratory-based academic physician scientist. Under the mentorship of Dr. Gary Koretzky, and utilizing the outstanding training environment in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at the University of Pennsylvania, this plan will help the candidate foster the skills needed for her to become an independent investigator evaluating the role of ILLs in the immune responses. The proposed research strategy aims to investigate the novel mechanism of cytokine driven T cell development and to define the function of CD8+ ILLs. Employing complementary in vitro and in vivo strategies, the focus of Aim 1 is to elucidate how Eomes and the IL-4 signaling pathway regulate CD8+ ILL development. There is currently scant data regarding the function of CD8+ ILLs. Therefore, Aim 2 is designed to investigate the role of CD8+ ILLs in response to bacterial and viral pathogens."
"9178668","Project Summary  Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the US. Following reperfusion, angiogenesis and restoration of microcirculation is a critical component in the recovery of normal cardiac function. Angiogenesis is also important for zebrafish heart regeneration. Much progress has been made towards understanding of the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis, but the connection between metabolism and angiogenesis is less studied. My preliminary studies strongly suggest that cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells regulates angiogenesis. I found that angiogenesis in vitro and in embryonic zebrafish was regulated by ApoA-I binding protein (AIBP), a secreted protein identified in a screen of proteins that physically associate with ApoA-I. AIBP accelerated ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells (EC) in vitro. Furthermore, AIBP controlled formation of segmental arteries (SeA) in embryonic zebrafish. Overexpression of AIBP inhibited SeA sprouting, while AIBP knockdown resulted in dysregulated SeA sprouting and branching. In my mentored K99 phase, I propose to test the hypothesis that secreted AIBP functions as a site-specific regulator of cholesterol efflux from EC and governs embryonic angiogenesis. First, I plan to demonstrate that AIBP-mediated, ABC transporters-dependent cholesterol efflux regulates embryonic angiogenesis in zebrafish. I found that the phenotype caused by the loss of AIBP was phenocopied by knockdown of cellular cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. My goal in this Aim is to prove that the effect of AIBP on embryonic angiogenesis relies on the AIBP function in cholesterol metabolism. These studies will establish a previously unrecognized mechanism connecting cholesterol efflux with embryonic angiogenesis. Then in my independent R00 phase, I will demonstrate that AIBP overexpression in adult zebrafish attenuates heart regeneration. Formation of coronary vasculature is believed to be important for heart regeneration because it conceivably provides resources necessary for robust proliferation of cardiomyocytes. I will make an AIBP conditional expression transgenic fish line, and investigate the impact of AIBP overexpression on angiogenesis that occurs during zebrafish heart regeneration. My second Aim in the independent R00 phase is to assess that AIBP expression modulates coronary angiogenesis in mice. Because my results suggest that AIBP limits angiogenesis, I propose that cardiomyocyte-specific loss of AIBP would promote angiogenesis under conditions of cardiac hypertrophy. These studies will elucidate a potential role for AIBP-governed angiogenesis in heart regeneration and in cardiac hypertrophy and suggest possible therapeutic interventions to stimulate the recovery of the microvasculature by promoting angiogenesis."
"9190766","PROJECT SUMMARY   The  modern  world  relies  upon  chemistry  to  provide  a  variety  of  essential  materials.  Of  particular  importance is the use of chemical synthesis to generate biologically relevant compounds to prevent, diagnose,  and  treat  disease.  It  is  imperative  to  render  these  processes  as  safe,  sustainable,  and  cost-­effective  as  possible to ensure the long-­term productivity of this field. Two of the most commonly utilized transformations to  this  end  are  oxidation  and  reduction  reactions.  Recently,  photoredox  catalysis  has  been  shown  to  be  a  powerful  tool  to  facilitate  these  reactions.  Photoredox  catalysis  has  the  benefit  of  utilizing  safe,  mild,  and  sustainable  terminal  oxidants  or  reductants  in  conjunction  with  a  small  amount  of  photosensitive  catalyst.  Furthermore,  iron  and  copper  are  earth  abundant  metals  that  have  been  shown  to  effect  a  variety  of  useful  oxidation reactions. However, if iron and copper oxidation reactions can be coupled with photoredox catalysis,  stoichiometric  metal  waste  can  be  circumvented  and  more  sustainable  processes  will  emerge.  An  important  oxidation  reaction  promoted  by  copper  and  iron  is  the  radical  enolate  coupling  with  indoles  to  furnish  substituted  indoles  and  the  radical  enolate  coupling  with  enolates  to  furnish  1,4-­dikeontes.  The  literature  pertaining  to  copper  and  iron  oxidation  is  rich,  however  no  catalytic  examples  exist.  Due  to  the  issues  associated  with  stoichiometric  use  of  copper  and  iron,  catalytic  asymmetric  methodologies  with  these  stoichiometric  oxidants  are  rare.  By  using  an  inexpensive  terminal  oxidant  to  re-­oxidize  copper  or  iron,  chiral  ligands may be employed on the metal centers to impart asymmetry on the bond formation.    The  Buchwald  group  has  a  history  of  developing  catalytic  reactions  that  are  useful  to  the  industrial  and  academic  arenas.  In  order  to  develop  an  asymmetric  dual  catalytic  oxidation  of  enolates  to  to  couple  with  indoles  and  enolates  we  will  first  explore  the  racemic  reaction  with  catalytic  amounts  of  copper  or  iron  in  the  presence  of  a  photocatalyst  and  stoichiometric  terminal  oxidant.  Once  the  racemic  reaction  has  been  developed  and  understood,  we  will  explore  the  use  of  chiral  ligands  on  copper  and  iron  to  generate  an  asymmetric enolate coupling reaction. We will also explore the implementation of this chemistry in photo-­flow  reactors. Finally, this reaction will be used as a tool effect surface modification through photo-­patterning.    The  research  proposed  herein  presents  an  innovative  approach  to  solving  the  challenges  of  catalytic  oxidation with iron and copper. Furthermore, the use of catalytic copper or iron will allow for the implementation  of asymmetric coupling reactions through the use of chiral ligands. By coupling photoredox catalysis with iron  and  copper  oxidation  chemistry,  these  already  useful  reactions  will  become  significantly  more  powerful.  Furthermore,  the  development  of  catalytic  oxidations  will  allow  for  the  application  of  these  reactions  to  more  diverse systems for chemical and material synthesis.  "
"9215409","PROJECT SUMMARY Humans have a profound, double-edged relationship with poxviruses. On one hand, the devastating effects of smallpox are unparalleled by any other pathogen in recorded history, and its eradication is a milestone in modern medicine. On the other, poxviruses are now used as highly effective gene therapy and vaccine vectors as well as oncolytics in the treatment of cancer. Moreover, molluscum contagiosum is widespread and causes prolonged, untreatable lesions, while emerging poxviruses are a serious concern. Indeed, smallpox evolved from a rodent Taterapox virus and zoonotic poxvirus infections resulting in human-to-human transmission are being reported at an increasing frequency. In some cases smallpox vaccination does not provide protection, while live smallpox vaccines such as Vaccinia Virus (VacV) pose serious, life-threatening complications for many individuals. As such, whether it be infection by existing or future poxviruses, zoonotic infections or complications from therapeutic vectors, it is important to understand how these unusual pathogens replicate. Unlike most other double-stranded DNA viruses, poxviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells within viral factories (VFs). Encoding >200 genes that include their own polymerases, transcription factors and redox system, poxviruses exhibit remarkable self-sufficiency. Despite this, poxviruses remain absolutely dependent on gaining access to host ribosomes in order to synthesize viral proteins, representing an exploitable weakness. Indeed, we have shown previously that VacV activates the host cap-dependent translation machinery and that this can be targeted using small molecules to suppress virus replication without cytotoxicity. Our preliminary data identifies a series of new and unexpected modifications induced by VacV. This includes a viral protein that remodels mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of ribosome recruitment and host immune responses, displacing regulatory subunits to render mTOR constitutively active and beyond host control. In addition, mass spectrometry and dual-color live cell imaging revealed that VacV phosphorylates the small ribosomal subunit, RACK1 at unique sites not induced by other viruses or stimuli, and recruits RACK1 to VFs as they form. Moreover, we find that this modification is required for selective synthesis of late VacV proteins, but not proteins of other viruses, and is induced by a VacV kinase. Finally, proteomic analysis of ribosome complexes isolated from primary human cells further revealed that VacV induces highly selective modifications to other ribosomal proteins and to the subunit composition of ribosomes themselves. Our data suggests that this ?ribosome specialization? is important for poxvirus protein synthesis, and is dispensable to the host. Understanding how these modifications facilitate VacV protein synthesis will provide important insights into fundamental aspects of poxvirus biology as well as mechanisms of selective mRNA translation. In addition, identifying factors involved in selective viral versus host protein synthesis has the potential to uncover new therapeutic targets and approaches to combat poxvirus infection."
"9185337","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic disease for youth in industrialized countries. Despite advances in medical treatments, the prevalence of asthma in youth continues to rise, resulting in a significant burden on society in terms of financial costs and lost productivity due to missed school days. Thus, there is a need to identify modifiable health behaviors, such as sleep duration, that may reduce the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations. Chronic partial sleep restriction (routinely sleeping less than required for optimal functioning) is common among adolescents, including youth with asthma, and is often behaviorally induced. Growing evidence has shown that chronic partial sleep restriction contributes to disease development and poorer health outcomes. For adolescents with asthma, chronic partial sleep restriction may result in poorer lung function and functional outcomes. Therefore, increased sleep duration may provide a novel, effective, low-cost intervention for the clinical management of asthma in adolescents. This project brings together investigators with substantial expertise in pediatric sleep, asthma, and immunology and will enroll 86 adolescents (ages 12-17 years) with asthma to participate in an established sleep manipulation protocol. Following a week of baseline sleep stabilization, adolescents with asthma will participate in a randomized, counterbalanced design that includes two experimentally manipulated weeks of sleep duration - one week of a deficient sleep opportunity (6.5 hours in bed per night) and one week of a healthy sleep opportunity (10 hours in bed per night). Subjects will complete both objective and subjective daily measures of sleep (actigraphy, sleep diary), as well as asthma control and lung function (electronic peak expiratory flow, asthma diary). Additional measures of lung function (spirometry), asthma control, health related quality of life, and inflammation (exhaled nitric oxide, serum cytokines) will be collected at the end of each study week. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of chronic partial sleep restriction vs. healthy sleep opportunity on lung function and functional outcomes in adolescents with asthma. An exploratory aim will examine the impact of chronic partial sleep restriction vs. healthy sleep opportunity on biomarkers of inflammation in adolescents with asthma. The proposed study would be the first to use an experimental manipulation of sleep duration in adolescents with asthma, and allows our team of pediatric experts to examine the causal impact of sleep duration on lung function and functional outcomes. In addition, this study will utilize objective measures of sleep duration, lung function, and inflammation (rather than relying on self-report measures), as well as standardized outcome measures of asthma control and health related quality of life. Finally, the protocol design closely mimics the chronic partial sleep deficiency experienced by many adolescents on school nights, promoting confidence that the findings will have real-world relevance and applicability in the clinical care for adolescents with asthma."
"9252932","Hantaviruses (HVs) predominantly infect the endothelial cell (EC) lining of capillaries and nonlytically cause vascular leakage. Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infect virtually all pulmonary ECs(109) and cause 35% fatal acute pulmonary edema (HV pulmonary syndrome-HPS). However, ANDV is the only HV spread person to person and the only HV that causes lethal HPS-like disease in hamsters. Pathogenic HVs regulate early innate immune responses in order to successfully replicate in ECs and we recently revealed that ANDV contains an additional interferon (IFN) regulating determinant that explains unique ANDV spread and virulence and is a potential target for attenuating ANDV.  HVs are inhibited by IFN added prior to or early after infection, and in order to replicate in human ECs pathogenic HVs regulate early IFN induction. Nonpathogenic PHV, fails to regulate IFN induction or replicate in human ECs, and failed IFN regulation explains why PHV is not a human pathogen. Except for PHV, HV Gn proteins contain cytoplasmic tail (GnT) elements that inhibit RIG-I/TBK1 directed IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN? induction. In contrast, N proteins from TULV, SNV, NY-1V, HTNV and PHV fail to inhibit RIG-I/TBK1 directed IFN induction. Unpredictably, the ANDV N protein inhibited RIGI/TBK1 directed IFN induction. In contrast, N protein from a nonpathogenic S. American HV, MAPV, failed to inhibit IFN signaling, yet MAPV N differs by only 12 dissimilar residues from ANDV N.  ANDV N protein inhibits TBK1 autophosphorylation that is required for TBK1 phosphorylation of IRF3 and our recent proteomics screen found that ANDV N binds a single IFN regulating protein in ECs, TRIM21. Reciprocal TRIM21 IPs validated ANDV N, but not TULV N, as a TRIM21 binding partner. Preliminary data indicates that mutating ANDV residues to MAPV N residues prevents IFN regulation and TRIM21 binding, and provides a mechanism for attenuating ANDV. Our findings suggest that IFN regulation by the ANDV N protein is a novel virulence determinant. This may explain why ANDV uniquely causes viremia and lethal HPS disease in Syrian hamsters and why ANDV is the only HV spread from person to person. These findings permit us to propose defining the role of N and Gn directed IFN regulation in attenuating ANDV and preventing lethal HPS in Syrian hamsters. We define mechanisms by which N and Gn proteins inhibit RIG-I/TBK1 signaling pathways and identify mutations that abolish regulation. We evaluate ANDV reassortants and mutants for attenuation in a lethal Syrian hamster HPS disease model.  We define HV virulence determinants by identifying N/Gn residues of ANDV, MAPV & SNV required to regulate RIG-I/TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathways. We analyze ANDV regulation of IFN inductionin ECs, ANDV N regulation of TRIM21, and N/Gn synergy in IFN regulation. ANDV/MAPV reassortants and N/Gn-?IFN rANDV mutants are evaluated for their attenuation and ability to protect Syrian hamsters from Wt ANDV infection."
"9239514","Cryptococcus neoformans is a deadly fungal pathogen that exhibits pronounced neurotropism: it is the most common cause of fungal meningitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients, resulting in over 620,000 deaths annually. How C. neoformans cells traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to infect the central nervous system (CNS) remains poorly understood. Our recent studies implicate inositol ? one of the most abundant metabolites in the brain ? in this process. In particular, we find that growth of C. neoformans under inositol-rich conditions enhances fungal virulence and that fungal mutants defective in inositol uptake exhibit reduced virulence, reduced capacity to transmigrate from the blood into the brain, and reduced ability to traverse a model BBB in vitro. We also find that C. neoformans compromises tight-junction integrity in vitro, promoting inositol leakage through the brain microvascular endothelial monolayer. Furthermore, we show that inositol induces the expression of fungal cell surface factors involved in virulence, including the polysaccharide capsule, a major fungal virulence factor, and hyaluronic acid (HA), a ligand important for fungal binding to the BBB. Finally, we find that growth on inositol promotes the production of capsule structures involved in immune evasion and that, conversely, C. neoformans mutants defective in inositol uptake elicit enhanced protective immunity during brain infection. Based on these results, we hypothesize that C. neoformans senses and utilizes host inositol to modify the fungal cell surface in a way that promotes penetration of the BBB and development of cryptococcal meningitis. Interestingly, C. neoformans contains an unusually complex inositol uptake system and catabolic pathway, which likely evolved from its utilization of the inositol stores of its plant reservoirs. Thus, this fungus may be uniquely adapted to thrive in the inositol-rich environment of the CNS and to utilize inositol-dependent pathways for pathogenesis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to obtain a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which C. neoformans acquires and utilizes host inositol to establish human brain infection. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) Define inositol sensing and metabolic pathways required for modifying fungal cell surface structure by using a combination of fungal mutagenesis analysis, enzymatic assays, and polysaccharide structural analysis; 2) Characterize the mechanism of inositol- mediated promotion of C. neoformans BBB crossing and CNS infection by using an in vitro BBB model system and in vivo animal models; and 3) Define the transcriptional circuits regulating inositol-dependent processes during cryptococcal brain infection by analyzing the expression and localization of fungal inositol factors and identifying transcription factors regulating their expression during infection. Together, these studies will elucidate a novel contribution of a brain metabolite, inositol, to the development of life-threatening fungal meningitis. As such, these studies promise to provide substantial insight into mechanisms by which pathogens cross the BBB and establish CNS infections."
"9332571","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection represents the most common viral infection transmitted in-utero and is a significant cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The rate of congenital HCMV infection ranges from 0.2-1.0% of live births in the US and exceeds 1% in many parts of the world. Although maternal infection during pregnancy (primary maternal infection) represents a significant risk for virus transmission to the fetus and disease, infection and transmission to the fetus in women with existing immunity to this virus (non-primary maternal infection) is frequent. Disease in babies infected following non-primary maternal infection is well documented. Worldwide, including most US populations, the disease burden in infected infants born to women with non-primary infections exceeds that of offspring of women with primary maternal infection. In this proposal we will explore two mechanisms of non-primary maternal infections, reinfection with new strain of viruses and recurrence/reactivation of a persistent infection. Our goals are to define virological characteristics of non-primary infections and parameters of HCMV specific immunity in a highly seroimmune population in which non-primary maternal infections account for the vast majority of infected babies. We will also determine the incidence of the most common long term sequelae of congenital HCMV infection, hearing loss, in infected babies. We anticipate these studies will help identify host responses associated with intrauterine transmission and damaging fetal infections in this population of women with non-primary infection and could aid in the rationale development of effective prophylactic and possibly therapeutic vaccines to limit the morbidity from this congenital infection."
"9180055","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Apoptosis is critical for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and for the maturation of various organs in the developing embryo. Failure to activate the cell death program results in embryonic lethality and severe central nervous system (CNS) defects, including hyperplasia of cells in the CNS, exencephaly (protrusion of brain matter from the skull), and incomplete neural tube closure. Although the apoptotic pathway has been well characterized in certain mammalian cell lines, exactly how cell death is regulated in primary embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in the neural precursor cells (NPCs) of the CNS remains largely unknown. In this proposal, I will explore a novel apoptotic pathway engaged by ESCs and NPCs that primes them for rapid death in the developing embryo. This proposal will test the hypothesis that these cells utilize a novel C. elegans-like apoptotic pathway for activating caspases and cell death independently of the mitochondria. In particular, I hypothesize that, similar to what is observed in cells undergoing apoptosis in the developing C. elegans embryo, ESCs and NPCs express a previously uncharacterized short form of the pro-apoptotic protein, sApaf-1, that exists in complex with, and is inhibited by, the anti-apoptotic Bc-xL protein. In Aim 1, I will investigate how the sApaf-1/Bcl-xL interaction regulates apoptosis in ESCs and NPCs. Specifically, I will examine the physical interaction between sApaf-1 and Bcl-xL and determine whether Bcl-xL inhibition or knockdown is sufficient to allow sApaf-1 to activate caspases and induce rapid apoptosis in both cell types. Importantly, I will test whether this novel pathway in ESCs and NPCs induces apoptosis by bypassing the mitochondria as observed in the C. elegans embryo. In Aim 2, I will investigate the sApaf-1/Bcl-xL apoptotic pathway in the developing brain in vivo. This aim will explore the increased cell death phenotype of conditional knockout mice that are deficient in Bcl-xL in the developing brain, and whether the cell death observed in these animals can be rescued by simultaneous deletion of Apaf-1. The results from this proposal will be important for uncovering key features of ESC and NPC biology that determine how cell death is regulated in early mammalian embryonic development."
"9108868","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common visual impairment in persons over 50 years of age. It has been estimated that 1 in 3 individuals over 75 years of age and 1 in 30 individuals over 52 years of age are affected by AMD. The deficits in visual function as a result of this disease affecting the central retina are debilitating, as individuals lose their abiity to carry out many of their daily activities that require resolving fine spatial details. Our previous studies have shown that training with oculomotor control exercises significantly increases reading speeds in patients with AMD. In the proposed study, we will examine whether these training exercises are effective when practiced at home.   In Phase 1, we will develop a standardized user-friendly, Web-based platform that will allow patients to easily self-administer training exercises. The software platform will be designed to automatically choose the appropriate exercises based on a patient's previous performance, run the training exercise, and collect performance data into a universal patient data file. In Phase 2, the platform will be teste in two settings: in standard clinical rehabilitation practice and in the patient's home. Reading outcomes in the two settings will be compared. We will recruit 60 patients per year for each of the three years for Phase 2 of the study.  Half of these patients will be assigned to the Clinic Training Group, while the other half will be assigned to At-home Training Group. For all patients, three assessments will be taken: at baseline, after 1 month, and after 2 months of training.   We will compare reading outcomes to assess the roles of feedback versus the role of frequent available practice. Because of the extensive cost and clinical resources required for vision rehabilitation, it is critical to determine whether the training program can be made less expensive, but as effective, when it is self-trained.  If we demonstrate the utility of at-home practice, clinical facilities and therapists' time can be made available for those activities requiing face-to-face contact."
"9234364","PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite the availability of antibiotics to combat Tuberculosis (TB), it is one of the leading causes of death due to infectious disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a successful pathogen because it survives within immune cells and effectively establishes and maintains a latent TB infection. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the establishment or maintenance of dormancy can inform new strategies for TB therapeutics.  Mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) proteins are dedicated cell wall lipid transporters. Along with their accessory Mycobacterial membrane protein small (MmpS) proteins, these transporters are crucial players in mycobacterial physiology and pathogenesis. MmpL3 is essential; and MmpL4, MmpL5, MmpL7, MmpL8, MmpL10 and MmpL11 contribute to Mtb virulence. The related proteins MmpL3 and MmpL11 that transport mycolic acid-containing lipids are of particular interest to us. MmpL3 transports trehalose monomycolate and is required for mycobacterial replication and viability. We showed that MmpL11 transports monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol and a mycolate ester wax. These are species of lipids that are sometimes referred to as ?storage lipids? and are associated with dormant bacteria in vitro and accumulate in granulomas of TB patients. Therefore, it appears that MmpL11 plays a role in a clinically relevant, but poorly understood, aspect of Mtb pathogenesis.  While significant advances have been made identifying MmpL substrates, the regulation of MmpL protein expression and their role in cell wall remodeling in different environmental conditions has not been explored. The proposed studies will characterize the structure and function of Mtb transcriptional regulators that control expression of essential and virulence-associated MmpL and MmpS proteins. Our preliminary data indicate that fatty acids directly modulate activity of these unique transcription factors. This suggests a model where Mtb can directly assess and respond to fatty acid intermediates, metabolic state and nutrient availability to control mmpL and mmpS gene regulation. By defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of MmpL transporters and identifying their regulons, we will generate novel insights into the transition between actively dividing Mtb and latent or non-replicating persistent Mtb. !"
"9258229","ABSTRACT  Infants are more susceptible to noise than adults, and learn speech and language in noisy environments. Visual speech could be one of the most important cues available to infants to compensate for noisy listening environments, but a coherent picture of audiovisual (AV) speech perception development has yet to emerge. Multiple mechanisms underlie AV benefit to speech perception in adults: common AV onsets and offsets provide information about when to listen, correlations between the amplitude envelopes of auditory and visual signals help to distinguish between different consonants, and experienced listeners can use visual/multimodal phonetic representations. Differences in the mechanisms underlying AV speech perception benefit across tasks and age groups have lead to inconsistencies in the developmental literature. In order to form a unified account of AV speech perception development, this research focuses on the development of the mechanisms underlying AV speech benefits. The proposed research will use a hierarchical framework to investigate AV speech perception. Specifically, the proposed research will compare performance across a hierarchy of perceptual tasks and use stimulus manipulations to limit the AV benefit mechanisms available to participants. The aims are to determine whether typically developing, 7-month-old infants use visual speech cues to improve detection, discrimination, and identification of auditory speech in noise and to investigate the mechanisms by which infants and adults benefit from visual speech. To that end adults and infants will complete auditory-only, visual-only, and AV speech detection, discrimination, and identification tasks, matched on procedural details, but varying in the level of perceptual processing required to perform them. An additional condition uses a visual speech signal that only provides information about the onset/offset of the auditory stimulus. The research uses an established, developmentally appropriate, and psychometrically rigorous behavioral testing method, the observer-based psychoacoustics procedure (Werner, 1995). We expect that (1) infants will detect, discriminate, and identify auditory speech in noise better when they can also see the talker compared to when they can only hear the talker, (2) infants' benefit will primarily result from the visual signal providing information about when to listen, and (3) infants will benefit less than adults on higher-level tasks because adults will use the crossmodal correlations and visual phonetic information to gain additional benefits on higher-level tasks. The proposed research will improve our understanding of how speech sound detection, discrimination, and identification interact with vision in infants and adults, and lead to a better understanding of the development of auditory perception in real-world listening environments. It will provide researchers with a context in which to study development in older children with normal hearing and infants and children with hearing loss. It will also provide the evidence-base for recommendations that parents promote and make use of AV skills in support of a hearing-impaired infant's or child's language acquisition."
"9190887","Project Summary  This proposal seeks support to investigate the use of a biologic scaffold composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) as an inductive scaffold for the in vivo generation of a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) meniscus. Approximately 3% to 4% of the population seeks treatment for TMJ disorders; 90% of which are women. Approximately 70% of patients with TMJ disorders suffer from disc displacement; a fact that identifies the TMJ disc as a critical component in the cascade of events that lead to TMJ pathology. Spontaneous TMJ disc regeneration in vivo does not occur, and subsequent articulate surface degeneration can lead to the need for total joint replacement with marked negative consequences upon the quality of life. Development of a replacement disc would protect articulate joint surfaces, mitigate morbidity, and obviate the need for subsequent joint replacement.  Strong pilot studies in a dog model indicate that extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds when implanted into the TMJ to serve as an inductive template, can stimulate the endogenous formation of a fibrocartilaginous disc that closely mimics the composition, structure, and mechanical properties of native disc material. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the efficacy of these scaffolds in a large animal pig study. Following implantation of ECM scaffolds into a pig model, constructive scaffold remodeling will be analyzed biomechanically and biochemically to elucidate the healing response.  The hypothesis of this study is twofold. First, it is hypothesized that constructive remodeling of an ECM scaffold into a functional TMJ disc is governed by degradation products of the non- crosslinked matrix. Second, it is hypothesized that constructive remodeling will also occur in association with a predominately M2 macrophage (constructive remodeling) phenotype response. Strong preliminary studies support this hypothesis. This is a focused 1-year study involving two Specific Aims."
"9369881","Mesothelioma is a rare though often fatal disease, often associated with exposure to asbestos. The differentiation of malignant mesothelioma from benign mesothelial proliferation is often achieved by assessing tissue invasiveness from histological examination of biopsy specimens. Pleural effusion (fluid between lung and the chest wall) cytology is often a less invasive procedure that can be made available in most hospitals. Diagnosis of this malignancy from cytology specimens is often not possible, given that tissue invasiveness cannot be assessed. Our proposal details a pilot project to be conducted in collaboration with the System Chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine of Western Pennsylvania Health System (Jan F. Silverman, M.D.), as well as the Anatomic Pathology Medical Director of the Cleveland Clinic (Tarik M. Elsheikh, M.D.) to test an image analysis approach most recently developed by Dr. Rohde's laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for cancer detection directly from pleural effusion cytology. Preliminary results resulting from the application of Dr. Rohde's methods to data provided by Dr. Silverman (detailed in the application) indicates the method can potentially be useful for diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. The objective of the pilot study would be to test the accuracy of the method developed by Dr. Rohde's laboratory in differentiating malignant mesothelioma from benign mesothelial proliferation directly from effusion cytology with a larger cohort of patients from two institutions (WPAHS and CC). If successful, the completion of the project could have a significant impact in reducing overall costs and avoiding health risks associated with invasive procedures. The successful completion of this project could also pave the way for the application of similar techniques on several similar cytopathology diagnostic and prognostic challenges."
"9386954","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial pathogens have conserved complex molecular machines that are required to cause disease. Among these machines are those that make up a type IV pilus (T4P) biogenesis apparatus and the related type II secretion (T2S) machine. T4Ps are surface appendages essential for adherence and host colonization by many important bacterial pathogens; T2S systems export toxins that are critical for many diseases. Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae all produce T4Ps. Among the components common to both machines is a pre-pilin peptidase enzyme that specifically removes the characteristic N-terminal signal sequence from pre-pilin proteins and N-methylates the nascent amino terminus. These enzymes are highly conserved, absolutely required for T4P and T2S function, and represent a novel class of neutral pH aspartic acid peptidases that do not resemble mammalian enzymes. As such, they are ideal targets for new drug discovery. We have devised an in vivo Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system comprised of three recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli: the pre-pilin peptidase, the pre-pilin protein fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP), and an essential assembly protein to which the pre-pilin binds fused to dsRed. Cleavage of the pre-pilin fusion protein by the pre-pilin peptidase releases eYFP and prevents FRET with dsRed. If the pre-pilin peptidase is inactivated by mutation, then FRET occurs. We will adapt this extremely sensitive system and a related even simpler system that relies on fluorescence anisotropy to develop in vitro high-throughput small molecule screens to identify pre-pilin peptidase inhibitor candidates. Secondary assays will establish specificity and spectrum of activity. The initial effort will provie candidates that will subsequently subjected to further chemical refinement to enhance potency, specificity and activity against whole bacteria. Finally, (a) lead compound(s) will be advanced to preclinical testing using an established murine model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia in which T4Ps are required for disease. Ultimately, the goal is to discover an entirely novel therapeutic class of anti-virulence agents to improve human health."
"9173057","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases exert a massive burden on human health, and our long term objective is to attenuate the excessive accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that is central to many of these diseases. The tunica media of the normal artery is composed of alternating circumferential layers of VSMCs and elastic lamellae. Diverse arterial disorders, including atherosclerosis, restenosis, pulmonary hypertension and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) are plagued by defective elastic lamellae as well as hypermuscularization. SVAS, a devastating human disease characterized by an increased VSMC burden that occludes large arteries, is caused by heterozygous null mutations in the elastin gene ELN. Similarly, elastin mutant mice develop hypermuscularization and stenosis of large arteries, such as the aorta. Major vascular surgery is the only current treatment for SVAS as no effective pharmacological options are available. A major obstacle to developing effective therapies for vascular disorders is the poor understanding of the cellular source(s) of excess VSMCs; indeed no prior studies have traced the lineage of any cell populations in elastin mutants. In addition, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying aortic hypermuscularization in elastin mutants are not well defined. Our initial studies indicate that integrin ?expression and integrin signaling is robustly upregulated in the elastin mutant aorta and that reduction of ?levels or activity attenuates the excessive muscularization. Furthermore, reduction of the dosage of the gene encoding ? Itgb3, extends the viability of Eln(-/-) pups which is unprecedented for any genetic or pharmacological intervention. A potentially attractive strategy for reducing arterial hypermuscularization in SVAS is attenuating the increased ?expression. Although little is known regarding regulation of ?expression, the growth arrest-specific homeobox (Gax) transcription factor is expressed in VSMCs and Gax overexpression reduces ?levels, proliferation and migration. We hypothesize that in elastin mutants, Gax downregulation induces integrin ?expression in pre-existing aortic smooth muscle resulting in aberrant VSMC orientation, proliferation and migration and thus aortic stenosis. This proposal utilizes studies of transgenic mutant mice, VSMCs isolated from the murine aorta and human SVAS aortic tissue and cells to test this hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) in the elastin mutant aorta, identify the cellular source(s) of excessive VSMCs; 2) in elastin deficient mice, murine VSMCs and human SVAS-derived smooth muscle cells, elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying integrin ?induced excess aortic muscularization; and 3) elucidate the role of Gax in mediating enhanced integrin ?expression and hypermuscularization in elastin mutants. Taken together, our proposed studies will delineate mechanisms underlying the identified link between elastin deficiency, integrin ?and aortic hypermuscularization and thereby provide concrete steps towards developing novel therapeutic strategies for SVAS and other vasculoproliferative diseases."

Conversely, RNA processing enzymes that catalyze different reactions might recognize ? and compete for ? substrates with the same end modification to control the outcome of RNA cleavage. These different scenarios could potentially be used to regulate the outcome of RNA cleavage, but we know very little about the roles of RNA end modification during RNA processing. We discovered that RNA end modification by the RNA 5´- kinase activity of the yeast tRNA ligase Trl1 is important to regulate the unfolded protein response by phosphorylating RNA intermediates during unintentional UPR activation to facilitate their turnover by 5´?3´ decay, and that Trl1 RNA 5´- kinase activity mediates the turnover of mRNA fragments created by co- translational ?no-go? mRNA decay. The human RNA 5´-kinase enzyme Clp1 has an important role in neuronal metabolism and differentiation, but we do not know the substrates of Clp1 and so it is not clear how dysfunction in RNA 5´-kinase activity leads to disease. Our discovery that Trl1 5´-kinase activity mediates the decay of mRNA cleavage fragments also begs the question of whether the Trl1 ligase can also repair RNAs, but only a few examples of RNA repair are known. To address these issues, we will focus on the following questions: 1. What are the substrates of the human Clp1 RNA 5´-kinase?; 2. How do RNA end modification and processing regulate the unfolded protein response?; 3. How are the products of no-go mRNA decay created, and what are its physiological substrates?; 4. Is RNA repair restricted to specific substrates, or does it act on other damaged RNAs? The outcomes of these studies will be an improved understanding of how RNA end modification is used after RNA cleavage to mediate RNA processing, and these insights may inform our understanding of how dysfunction in RNA end modification underlies human disease."
"9028999","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastasis is the primary cause of death for cancer patients. Dissemination from the primary tumor depends on the ability of cancer cells to migrate. We and others have used multi-photon microscopy to observe the behavior of tumor cells in tumors of living mice in real time. This has demonstrated the presence of streaming migration in mammary tumors. Streaming migration of tumor cells toward blood vessels accumulates tumor cells in the perivascular microenvironment. An essential step in metastatic dissemination of perivascular tumor cells involves intravasation where the tumor cell must cross the basement membrane of the endothelium of blood vessels. Degradation and penetration of the basement membrane requires protrusive invadopodia which are regulated by EGF receptor, alpha5beta1 and its associated Src-regulated Abl-family kinase Arg. Intravasation in vivo requires the assembly and maturation of an invadopodium on the tumor cell that is associated with the blood vessel endothelium. The site in the mammary tumor where this assembly occurs is called TMEM.  Invadopodium assembly in TMEM requires activation of Cofilin severin- and cortactin/N-WASP-Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. The Mena/RhoC/cofilin pathway of the Invasion Signature activates these proteins to cause localized actin polymerization from the invadopodium core. The activity status of the cofilin pathway, cortactin expression and its phosphorylation and Mena expression in breast tumors are correlated with increased metastatic potential, further implicating these pathways of the Invasion Signature in invadopodium formation, and the metastatic phenotype. In particular, the expression status of Mena isoforms that support TMEM assembly and function, as well as a marker of cofilin activity in situ, independently predict risk of death due to metastasis in breast cancer patients. In addition, the density of TMEM sites in breast tumors predicts risk of distant metastasis in breast cancer patients. These clinical results emphasize the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating invadopodium assembly and function during chemotaxis of streaming tumor cells toward blood vessels and in TMEM-associated tumor cells. Molecular understanding will not only improve on the 3 existing prognostics resulting from this work (MenaCalc, TMEM and Cofilin) but will also provide pharmaco-dynamic end points as companion diagnostics for drugs designed to inhibit blood vessel-mediated tumor cell dissemination and metastasis."
"9225366","PROJECT SUMMARY: Many infectious diseases exhibit differential severity between the sexes yet the mechanisms driving such innate biases are incompletely understood. Staphylococcus aureus (SA), including methicillin-resistant (MRSA), is the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) in the US, and males have a greater than 2-fold higher incidence of infection versus females. Neutrophils are essential for clearance of SA skin infections, and we found that, consistent with murine infection outcomes, neutrophils from female mice are better able to clear SA ex vivo compared to neutrophils from male mice. Major contributors to neutrophil killing of SA include oxidative burst, antimicrobial factors in neutrophil granules, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Therefore, in this exploratory proposal, we aim to align the efficacy of neutrophil phagocytosis and killing of SA ex vivo with measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, NET formation, and changes in gene and protein expression and activation, to define the mechanism(s) of sex-specific phagocyte efficacy against SA. Furthermore, we have identified sex-specific modulators which enhance phagocyte efficacy and will determine the mechanisms by which these modulators augment innate defense. Upon the successful completion of these aims, we will have gained significant insight into the mechanisms of sex-specific phagocyte efficacy against SA, as well as mechanisms and/or targets for augmenting host innate defense."
"9202088","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Methamphetamine (MA) dependence and HIV infection are highly comorbid conditions, the combination of which greatly increases the likelihood of poor disease outcomes, in part due to elevated rates of antiretroviral (ARV) nonadherence. Both HIV and MA are associated with poor medication management, a multifactorial health behavior that underlies successful adherence to ARV therapy. Adding to the risk of poor medication adherence in this group, the neurotoxic effects of comorbid HIV and MA preferentially impact frontostriatal brain regions, resulting in an increased prevalence of neurocognitive disorders that affects up to 60% of the HIV/MA population. The profile of neurocognitive impairment in HIV/MA includes prominent deficits in learning, which is a cognitive ability that is critical for optimal medication management. Despite the prevalence and ecological relevance of poor medication management in HIV/MA, to date there are no empirically validated neurocognitive techniques aimed at improving medication management in this high-risk population. One neurocognitive technique that has been effective for improving learning as well as long-term retention within cognitive psychology and applied educational psychology studies is interleaved practice, in which different types of material to be learned are practiced in a mixed, or interleaved, fashion, instead of being blocked by type (e.g., abcbcacab vs. aaabbbccc). Within healthy populations, the beneficial effects of interleaved practice have been documented across a wide range of skills and knowledge bases, many of which are relevant to medication management behaviors (e.g., numeracy). Accordingly, the proposed F31 dissertation project seeks to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of interleaved practice (versus standard blocked practice and no practice) on numerical medication management performance in MA/HIV; 2) determine whether interleaved practice (versus standard blocked practice and no practice) is associated with greater transfer of learned skills to different medication management problems; and 3) explore potential demographic, psychiatric, HIV disease, health literacy, and addiction effects on the interleaved practice effect on medication management in MA/HIV. Given the current absence of such techniques in this population, results from this project may inform future projects that aim to develop novel cognitive techniques for enhancing adherence and other health-related behaviors in HIV/MA. Through the implementation of this dissertation research project and the comprehensive training plan entailed in this F31 proposal, the applicant will enhance her scientific knowledge, research methodology, and ability to further contribute to the fields of neurocogniton, everyday functioning, and health behavior functioning in neuroAIDS and addictions. Moreover, the opportunities afforded by this F31 training and research plan will be extremely valuable in consideration of the applicant's short- and long-term goals toward becoming an independent academic neuropsychologist dedicated to improving the lives of persons living with HIV infection and addictions."
"9309439","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of new chemical methodologies is an important objective of organic synthesis. An area that continues to inspire chemists is the chemistry of organoboranes and boronates. The unique properties of boron and the ability to activate organic boronates to deliver carbon nucleophiles has yielded an impressive array of chemical methods and processes. We will extend the ability of organoboranes and boronates to deliver carbanion equivalents in novel condensation reactions including chemoselective carbonyl condensations and multicomponent reactions. The reactions will be rendered asymmetric through the development of asymmetric catalysts and chiral boronate reagents and the utility of the methods developed demonstrated by the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Significant advances have been made in the mechanistic understanding of boronate activation via ligand exchange with chiral diols. We will use the mechanistic insight we have obtained to expand the repertoire of reactions catalyzed by dynamic ligand exchange processes to include acyl cyanides as electrophiles, borono-Petasis reactions, and ortho-quinone methide chemistry. Our continued interest in reaction discovery has led to the identification of chiral diol acid catalysts capable of promoting the enantioselectie addition reactions to acetals. We seek to explore this reactivity and expand it to include types of functionalized nucleophiles in additions to oxoniums and iminiums and boronate hetero-Diels-Alder reactions. Goals of the research program include developing a breadth of reactivity, providing access to novel chiral blocks, and new reaction development. Bond constructions are selected to access chiral synthetic intermediates that could be used in the construction of pharmaceuticals and natural products. The results will transform the way boronate nucleophiles are utilized in enantioselective synthesis."
"9388966","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Veterans who suffered severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are burdened by chronic neurological deficits and are at increased risk for developing chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) later in life. Currently, there are no effective treatments for improving long-term functional recovery and reducing the risk of AD in TBI survivors. Thus, successful rehabilitation of brain-injured veterans and prevention of chronic disability is an area of medical research that warrants intensive investigation. Our preliminary data demonstrated that a single post-injury injection of memantine, an FDA approved drug for treatment of cognitive deficits in AD patients, improved neurological outcome acutely after experimental TBI in rats. However, the degree to which memantine therapy after TBI can improve long-term recovery, enhance neuronal repair and reduce secondary injury processes such as brain inflammation, brain hypoperfusion, and accumulation of amyloid-2 (A2) peptide (all of which contribute to the etiology of AD), remains to be determined. We propose a series of experiments that will directly address these issues by performing experimental controlled cortical impact (CCI) brain injury in rats and in a mouse model of AD. Aim 1: We will perform a dose response analysis of chronic (3 weeks) daily memantine administration on histopathology and neurological recovery in rats after CCI injury (Aim 1a). We will also determine if the beneficial effects of the 3-week treatment will be sustained over an extended chronic (3 month) recovery period, or if prolonged daily treatment is necessary to achieve long-term beneficial effects (Aim 1b). Aim 2: We will assess whether memantine can act as a cognitive enhancer after TBI by administering the drug only during the time of behavioral testing (days 14-19 post injury). We will also determine if potential cognitive enhancing effects are transient or sustained by re-testing the animals 3 months after injury. Aim 3: We will determine if chronic functional outcome after TBI can be improved further by combining memantine therapy with simvastatin therapy, an FDA approved lipid lowering drug. Aim 4: We will examine if memantine and/or combined memantine/simvastatin therapy can suppress post- injury increases in the neurotoxic amyloid-2 (A2) peptide, a molecule central to the pathogenesis of AD. We will achieve this by using a unique mouse model that has been modified genetically to produce human A2 (hA2), which differs from rodent A2 in that it is toxic to neurons and synapses. Aim 5: Analyses proposed in Aim 4 will be complemented by measurements of cerebral blood flow, which is impaired after TBI and influenced by A2 concentrations, and can contribute to the development of AD. In all experiments, we will assess motor, vestibular, and memory function at three weeks and/or three months after injury, as appropriate. Endpoint analyses will include histological analyses of lesion size, cell number, synapse density, microglia/astrocyte activation, A2 concentrations, as well as levels of recovery-promoting brain derived neurotrophic factor and soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha. Collectively, these experiments will determine if chronic memantine therapy is an effective way of improving rehabilitation after TBI, allowing for its quick translation into clinical practice for treatment of injured veterans."
"9287270","Abstract Infection with HIV-1 elicits complex, fine-tuned immune responses that involve virtually all components of the innate and adaptive immune system. Yet, this immune response fails in most cases to control the infection, and there are reasons to believe that in many cases, immune responses to HIV contribute to disease pathogenesis by increasing abnormal immune activation and facilitating the establishment of a long-lasting reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells, thus propagating a disease they are meant to restrict. While innate and adaptive effector cell responses against HIV-1 have been analyzed in detail in the last years, there is still a remarkable knowledge gap in the understanding of molecular events and host-pathogen interactions inside CD4 T cells that determine the efficacy of the HIV-1 life cycle and influence the fate and survival of HIV-1 infected cells. However, immune responses to HIV-1 within the actual viral target cells arguably represent one of the most active and one of the most effective antiviral immune defense mechanisms that may have a profound effect on the dynamics of clinical HIV-1 disease progression. Here, we propose to take advantage of recent methodological advances for high- throughput, ultra-sensitive protein and phosphoprotein profiling to analyze molecular events and cell-intrinsic immune responses to HIV-1 inside the main target cells for HIV-1. In Specific Aim 1, we will focus on phosphorylation of HIV-1 gene products by host kinases. We hypothesize that specific sequence motifs within the HIV-1 proteome are susceptible to phosphorylation by host kinases in vivo, and represent sites of extraordinary viral vulnerability that have a profound impact on viral fitness; identifying such sites may have important implications for generating a comprehensive view of the HIV-1 fitness landscape and for selecting viral sequences to be included in vaccines and immunogens. In Specific Aim 2, we will analyze proteomic and phosphoproteomic responses to productive HIV-1 infection, and test the hypothesis that HIV-1 infection induces specific molecular pathways that maintain survival and homeostasis of infected cells. These studies build on a substantial set of provocative preliminary data indicating that proteomic signatures of HIV-1 infected cells show selective activation of cell survival programs, and hold promise for identifying molecular targets for reducing viability and persistence of virally infected cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will focus on analyzing the proteomic and phosphoproteomic signatures of latently-infected CD4 T cells, which are regarded as the main reason for our current insufficiency to eradicate and cure HIV-1 infection. These studies have the potential to discover novel functional pathways that are involved in regulation of viral latency and persistence, and will provide data that may significantly enhance our ability to detect, monitor and therapeutically eliminate latently-infected cells."
"9381030","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate's short-term goal is to obtain a faculty position at an academic research institute; her long-term goal is to better understand the nature and molecular underpinnings of tumor-stroma crosstalk in pancreatic cancer, and to harness this improved understanding to treat the human disease. She intends to focus on pancreatic stellate cells, myofibroblast-like cells of the tumor microenvironment, and study how these unique lipid-storing cells interact with tumor cells to effect gene expression, metabolism, and growth. The candidate's background in cancer biology and gene expression analysis will be supplemented by the expertise in high-throughput sequencing and metabolic physiology in the lab and at the present institution to help her realize her goals. Further, the extensive mentorship experience of the advisor and the contributions of a well-balanced mentorship committee will enhance the candidate's scientific and professional development as she transitions to independence. The studies proposed here will evaluate novel mechanisms underlying PDAC tumor-stroma interactions with the following specific aims. Aim 1: Examine the role of stromal VDR/NF-kB crosstalk in PDAC desmoplasia and tumor growth. Recent data suggest that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) negatively regulates PSC activation, leading to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes in PSCs and decreased paracrine induction of factors that support tumor growth, by inhibiting NF-kB chromatin occupancy and target gene expression. The role of stromal VDR/NF-kB crosstalk will be examined in patient-derived PSC lines and in a new allograft model of PDAC featuring prominent desmoplasia. These experiments will determine the significance of these factors in the activation of key pathways known to regulate pancreatic cancer cell growth and metabolism. Aim 2: Understand the effect of PSC secreted factors on cancer cell lipid metabolism. Using recently developed systems for analysis of tumor-stroma crosstalk, the candidate will interrogate the link between lipid metabolism and gene expression, in the context of PSC secreted factors. Preliminary data suggest that PSCs secrete factors that foster the recently established fatty acid scavenging phenotype of Kras- transformed cells while providing signaling modulators that impact the availability of acetyl-CoA as a substrate for histone acetylation. The results from these studies will be useful in understanding the unique metabolic properties of PDAC cells. Aim 3: Evaluate paracrine regulation of redox homeostasis by PDAC stromal cues.  The contribution of structural and diffusible features of the tumor stroma will be assessed in tumor cells faced with cellular stress relevant to the tumor microenvironment.  These studies will help to define the nature of paracrine pro-survival pathways that contribute to redox balance in the neoplastic compartment, and that may serve as new therapeutic targets. Together, the proposed experiments will probe previously unexplored aspects of PDAC biology, with the potential to uncover novel vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention."
"9385026","Over the last 15 years, our group has successfully managed the coordinating and bioinformatics unit (CBU) for two NIDDK funded consortia, the Diabetic Complications Consortium (DiaComp 2001-present, formerly the Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium) and the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Centers (MMPC, 2006-present). DiaComp provides an environment to foster communications and collaborations between investigator communities involved in diabetic complications research. Toward this goal, DiaComp sponsors annual meetings in complications-relevant scientific areas, solicits and funds pilot projects in high impact areas of complications research, and supports a website to serve the diabetic complications community. During the current five year funding cycle, the CBU was responsible for continuing support for DiaComp through the use of opportunity pools (funding), manage/maintain the website and phenotyping data and administratively organize the meetings and workshops sponsored by the DiaComp to engage the greater diabetic complications scientific community. In contrast, the MMPCs are charged with providing the scientific community with standardized, high quality metabolic and physiologic phenotyping services for the mouse. The MMPC provides state-of-the-art technologies to investigators for a fee, with their services including characterization of mouse metabolism, blood composition (including hormones), energy balance, eating and exercise, organ function and morphology, physiology and histology. Over the last ten years the two consortia have been managed by one CBU because of the NIH decision to integrate the activities of the two consortia during their second funding cycles. Our laboratory has been the CBU for both DiaComp (last 15 years) and the MMPC (last 10 years). The CBU is responsible for creating and maintaining the administrative, scientific and informatics infrastructure necessary to organize and facilitate their operations. The goal of this proposal is to provide that infrastructure. We will build upon the success of the current DiaComp/MMPC CBU infrastructure to provide both DiaComp and MMPC with a robust and comprehensive service oriented solution that supports both the common and unique aspects of each."
"9278678","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Most viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells form neoorganelles that serve as sites of viral genome replication and particle assembly. These highly specialized inclusion structures concentrate viral replication proteins and nucleic acids, prevent activation of cell-intrinsic defenses, and coordinate release of progeny particles. Despite the importance of inclusion complexes in viral replication, there are key gaps in knowledge about how these organelles form and mediate their functions. The proposed research uses reovirus, a genetically tractable experimental model that shows promise for oncolytic and vaccine applications, to elucidate mechanisms of double-stranded (ds) RNA virus inclusion formation, genome replication, and progeny particle release. Like other dsRNA viruses, which include important pathogens of animals (orbiviruses) and humans (rotaviruses), reovirus inclusions are nucleated by viral nonstructural proteins that recruit viral structural proteins for genome replication and particle assembly. We have discovered that reovirus inclusions are embedded in lipid and that progeny reovirus particles are transported from inclusions and released from some types of cells using a mechanism that does not cause cell lysis. Three integrated specific aims are proposed to fill key knowledge gaps about reovirus inclusion biogenesis and function. In Specific Aim 1, mechanisms underlying formation of reovirus inclusions will be determined using correlative light and electron microscopy coupled with electron tomography and biochemical analyses. Membrane-biosynthetic pathways required for reovirus inclusion formation will be identified using pharmacologic inhibitors and gene deletions of candidate host molecules. In Specific Aim 2, functions of reovirus nonstructural protein ?NS, an essential reovirus inclusion component that binds viral RNA and GTP, will be defined using in vitro assays of RNA binding and kinase activity. The structure of ?NS alone and in complex with its ligands will be determined using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.  Activities of ?NS in reovirus replication will be determined using viruses with structure-guided mutations in ?NS engineered by reverse genetics and inhibitors of ?NS GTP-binding activity. In Specific Aim 3, pathways used by reovirus to exit infected cells will be elucidated using electron tomography and target-specific molecular probes. Candidate vesicular pathways will be tested for function in reovirus egress using RNAi, pharmacologic inhibitors, and dominant-negative mutants. New host mediators of reovirus exit will be identified using an RNAi-based viral egress screen. These studies will enhance a basic understanding of mechanisms by which pathogenic viruses alter cellular architecture to engineer inclusion organelles, replicate their genomes, and exit infected cells. We anticipate that this information will foster development of antiviral drugs that impede these essential viral replication steps and enhance the use of reovirus as an oncolytic therapeutic."
"9173047","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are highly specialized cells that express high levels of SMC-specific proteins, such as smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC/Myh11) and smooth muscle-?ctin (?A/Acta2)1. Under pathological conditions, however, SMCs are capable of undergoing profound phenotypic and functional changes resulting in a proliferative, inflammatory phenotype. An important paradigm shift in recent years suggests that vascular progenitor cells (VPCs) reside in a specialized niche within the adventitia of postnatal vessels. Adventitial VPCs express several stem cell markers, including Sca1 and CD34, have the capacity to differentiate in vitro into multiple lineages in response to specific signals, and potentially contribute to intimal lesions in vivo. However, important unanswered questions remain, including their origin, their degree of pluripotency and/or heterogeneity, and their contribution to vessel maintenance, repair, and pathological lesion formation. Using an innovative in vivo fate-mapping approach to genetically label mature Myh11- expressing SMC, we definitively established that mature SMCs give rise to the majority of intimal SMCs in response to wire-induced injury. Quite unexpectedly, we made the observation that some mature SMCs reverse migrate into the adventitia, exhibit no detectable expression of SM markers, but gain expression of Sca1 and CD34. We established that a distinct subpopulation of AdvSca1 progenitors arise from mature SMCs through a process we are calling endogenous adventitial reprogramming and suggest these cells play important roles in arterial homeostasis and disease. Our preliminary findings suggest SMC-derived AdvSca1 cells reside in the adventitia and contribute to a heterogeneic population of resident VPCs that possess distinct biological properties and fate decisions. Our overall hypothesis is that mature SMCs are reprogrammed during the later stages of vascular development to a subpopulation of functionally distinct VPCs; reprogramming is dependent at least in part on induction of the transcription factor, Klf4 and loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN. After vascular injury, mobilization and recruitment of these cells contributes to intimal lesion formation and vessel repair. Our data could have a profound impact on defining the endogenous molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of resident VPCs, which could lead to the potential to manipulate these cells in situ to improve therapeutic applications in settings suc as atherosclerosis/restenosis, aneurysm formation, ischemic tissues, and tumor angiogenesis. Mature macrovessel SMCs, as the source of resident VPCs, involving more than SMC dedifferentiation, but reprogramming to a functional progenitor phenotype, has not been described. Three Aims are proposed to define the differentiation potential and response of SMC- derived VPCs to vascular injury (Aim One), to define the role of Klf4 and PTEN on SMC reprogramming and identify essential endogenous pathways involved in SMC reprogramming (Aim Two), and define the in vivo fate and function of SMC-derived VPCs in response to vascular injury (Aim Three)."
