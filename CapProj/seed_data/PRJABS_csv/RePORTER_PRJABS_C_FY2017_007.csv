"9335138","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hemoglobin disorder with 300,000 infants born affected each year globally. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of pneumonia. Sickle cell (SS) patients are 600 times more susceptible to S. pneumoniae infections than the general population. This increased risk of pneumococcal infection is attributed mainly to lack of a functional spleen in SS patients. However, SS patients are still more susceptible than persons lacking a functional spleen for reasons other than SCD. Interventions such as antibiotics, vaccination, and hydroxyurea treatment have helped counteract this increased risk; yet, pneumococcal infection still poses a great risk for SS patients. Poor infection control in SS patients is mainly due to antibiotic resistance and the emergence of non-vaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae. Recently, it has been demonstrated the SS environment itself leads to increased virulent strains of S. pneumoniae as well as differences in vaccine efficacy. Therefore, the long-term goal of this study is to gain a greater comprehension of the immune system in SCD, which will enable development of new preventative strategies and/or treatment of S. pneumoniae infection in SS patients. Specifically, the immediate goal of this proposal is to determine whether SCD and/or treatments given to sickle cell patients long-term have an affect on a specific subset of B cells, which provide the essential immediate protection from S. pneumoniae infection.  Murine B-1a cells arise mainly during fetal development. These cells are essential for immediate protection and therefore survival from S. pneumoniae infection. The unique ability of fetal derived B-1a cells to provide protection against S. pneumoniae is attributed to their spontaneously secreted non-immune (natural) IgM, which is germline-like due to minimal insertion of N-region additions and little somatic hypermutation. It has been shown that the number of splenic B-1a cells is significantly reduced in a mouse model of SCD. We hypothesize that the level of natural IgM protection changes in SCD as a result of functional and/or repertoire associated alterations to the B-1a cell pool in response to the SS environment alone and/or commonly used therapies in SCD. To test this hypothesis and determine whether the SS environment and/or common treatments for this disease leads to a change in protective natural IgM we will perform the following aims: 1) Determine whether the function of the B-1a cell pool changes in sickle cell disease; and, 2) Evaluate the ability of natural IgM in sickle cell disease to protect against S. pneumoniae infection. This project will determine the effect SCD and/or treatments for this disease has on the ability of B-1a cells to provide immediate protection from S. pneumoniae infection. This further understanding of the SS immune system will provide new information that will likely lead to strategies and/or treatments of S. pneumoniae infection in SS patients."
"9385124","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Department of Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH) at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) College of Public Health provides graduate education leading to the Master of Science (MS) degree in Industrial Hygiene and Environmental Health Sciences (IH/EHS). The goal of the IH/EHS program is to prepare professional practitioners to apply scientific knowledge to the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control of environmental hazards or stresses affecting human health. The IH/EHS degree has been prized by employers and students because graduates are prepared to direct environmental compliance programs, as well as occupational health and safety programs. The IH/EHS program at OUHSC is one of only four ABET-accredited masters level industrial hygiene programs in the south central United States. The program has been accredited by the Applied Science Accreditation Commission (ASAC) of ABET since 2000. The curriculum consists of 48 semester hours of coursework, including masters thesis research and a field practice experience, and it can be completed in 21-24 months of full-time study. Some courses are taught in innovative compressed format to better serve the needs of students who are working professionals. The OEH Department consists of 7 full-time faculty with diverse research interests and rich experience in professional practice. The Department is well-equipped with laboratory and field sampling instruments in support of the training program. The Specific Aims of the proposed continuation of the NIOSH training project grant (TPG) are: (1) to attract highly qualified and motivated students, including individuals with cultural or linguistic fluency relatedto underserved populations, into the industrial hygiene profession and (2) to recruit students with diverse technical backgrounds who are interested in entering the industrial hygiene field. TPG funds will be used to support four traineeship slots per year, to be filled by full-time masters-level trainees. Trainees may be supported on the TPG for up to 24 months. It is anticipated that 10 new and 2 continuing trainees will be supported during the 5-year project period. The program has traditionally drawn well-prepared applicants from a number of undergraduate programs in the region. Oklahoma colleges have relatively high American Indian enrollments reflecting the state's unique ethnic mix, presenting an excellent pool of well-qualified prospectiv trainees from under-represented minorities. Recruitment will also target individuals with work experience in the health professions, engineering, chemistry, and environmental science who wish to make the transition into industrial hygiene practice."
"9258681","While insulin?s effects in the periphery has been studied extensively, insulin?s effects on neural function in the adult brain are poorly understood. Infusion of insulin directly into the brain reduces food intake in rodents, and intranasal insulin reduces food intake in humans, though the mechanism(s) of this effect is unknown (Brown et al. 2006; Benedict et al., 2008; Figlewicz et al. 2006). In addition, insulin decreases excitatory transmission onto dopamine neurons in adult rodents (Labouebe et al. 2013; Liu et al., 2013) and enhances dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc; Stouffer et al., 2015). However, no studies have examined insulin?s effects on neurotransmission in brain circuits that influence feeding in lean or obese individuals. Our objective is to determine how insulin regulates excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the NAc in the normal and obese state. The NAc influences both the initiation of feeding and the consumption of food through regulation of distinct sub-circuits (Kelley, 2004; Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Figlewicz and Sipols, 2010). For example, increases in excitatory transmission in the NAc core increases food-seeking (Brown et al., 2015), whereas decreases in the NAc shell can induce feeding (Maldonado-Irizarry et al., 1995; Peters and Kalivas, 2006). Excitatory drive to the NAc is provided by glutamatergic inputs from several brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; Ding et al., 2001) and disruption of these inputs perturbs feeding (Land et al., 2014). Our preliminary data show that insulin bi-directionally influences excitatory transmission in the NAc. However, the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. Furthermore, in obese rats, insulin receptor-induced increases in excitatory transmission are absent. This is consistent with the idea that obesity produces central insulin resistance. We will combine electrophysiology, biochemical and optogenetic approaches in normal and obese rats to determine the mechanisms by which insulin modulates glutamatergic transmission in the NAc, and will examine the specific role of prefrontal cortical inputs to the NAc in effects of insulin."
"9381746","PROJECT SUMMARY A crucial function of the central nervous system is to bias behavior toward events and outcomes that hold relevance for survival. It is well recognized that odors have a strong effect on animal behavior, as they guide food search and selection, maternal bonding, and mate selection. Even though humans do not consider olfaction to be a dominant sense, humans are similarly swayed by the rewarding properties of smells. With recent developments in the pattern-based analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we are now in a position to explore the neural mechanisms of olfactory reward processing in humans. The objective of the current research proposal is to capitalize on these novel methods in order to understand the neural mechanisms of odor-guided behavior in humans. Specifically, we will use functional and structural brain imaging in combination with olfactory psychophysics to reveal the functional anatomy and coding mechanisms of olfactory reward processing. The proposed studies will examine predictive neural representations of food odor identity and reward value, and their importance for olfactory reward-based behavior and learning. Complementary studies will track the anatomical pathways between olfactory and limbic brain regions, and delineate the specific information that is transmitted via these connections. Together these experiments will open a new window into understanding olfactory reward processing in the human brain at the functional, mechanistic, and anatomical level, with implications for neuroscientific research on adaptive behavior in general. Moreover, the findings of this research can lead to a better understanding of the olfactory and behavioral deficits described in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, and may ultimately provide insights into the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic clinical approaches."
"9151413","Abstract This is a renewal application for the Rutgers University CounterACT Research Center of Excellence, which is focused on the discovery and development of drugs to treat poisoning from exposure to vesicants including sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and other mechanistically related chemical threat agents. The Center consists of three Research and Development Projects, each focused on a major vesicant target: the skin, the cornea and the lung. The overall goal of the Center is to identify specific targets in these tissues that can be used for therapeutic intervention. To accomplish this goal, mechanistic research using appropriate models for the skin, cornea and lung is being performed by scientific experts in each of these areas. The Research and Development Projects are supported by a Pharmacology and Drug Development Scientific Support Core and a Pharmaceutics and Medicinal Chemistry Scientific Support Core, each consisting of investigators with considerable expertise in drug discovery, delivery and development. The Rutgers Center has discovered several efficacious lead compounds and developed innovative formulations and delivery systems that increase pharmacological activity and improve pharmacokinetic profiles. Two lead compounds, one for mustard- induced ocular injury and another for mustard-induced lung injury, are FDA approved for other uses, and are being advanced for use as mustard countermeasures. IND-enabling studies have been completed on a lead compound discovered to be effective against mustard-induced skin injury. The Rutgers CounterACT Center has established strategic corporate partnerships for advanced drug development with lead compounds and support by BARDA. A Research Education Core directed at students, postdoctoral trainees, technical staff, and new and established investigators has been highly successful and efforts will be expanded during the next grant period. Plans are to continue mechanistic research with the goal of identifying and developing second generation drug products with improved effectiveness. Current drug leads will also be advanced in the FDA approval process. It is anticipated that Center efforts will result in new drugs that will be in the advanced approval process for treating vesicant poisoning in humans."
"9238993","ABSTRACT Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS conjugate vaccines (PCV) have had remarkable impact in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), but there is still a gap in treatment and prevention of pneumococcal disease as current vaccines are less effective for pneumonia than IPD and less immunogenic in patients most at risk for disease. My group has a longstanding interest in vaccine-elicited PPS antibodies and how they work. We made the paradigm-shifting discovery that while some PPS3 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that protect mice from serotype 3 (ST3) pneumococcus mediate phagocyte killing of ST3 in vitro (opsonic), others do not (non-opsonic). These MAb types have distinct PPS3 specificities and require different effectors and Fc?Rs to protect mice from ST3 pneumonia. Opsonic antibodies induce early lung bacterial clearance, but non-opsonic MAbs do not, instead they reduce lung inflammation. These findings challenge prevailing dogma that vaccine efficacy is solely a function of opsonic antibodies and show there is still much to learn about how PPS antibodies mediate protection. The goal of this application is to make human monoclonal antibodies (huMAbs) to treat ST3 pneumonia. Ultimately, we wish to develop a multi-ST huMAb cocktail, but ST3 will be our first target as PCV13 is less effective for ST3, an important cause of pneumonia that still carries higher risk of death than other STs. We hypothesize huMAbs that balance ST3 clearance and control of host inflammation will provide the most protection. We will generate PPS3 huMAbs from pneumococcal vaccine recipients, use a novel ST3 glycan array to identify huMAb PPS3 epitopes, and determine their functional activities in vitro and efficacies against ST3 in vivo in colonization, pneumonia, and sepsis models in normal and human (hu)Fc?R transgenic mice. This will identify candidate huMAbs to advance for therapy, reveal potentially new correlates of protection, and identify potential adjunctive PPS3 antigens to enhance vaccine efficacy for pneumonia. This project will advance understanding of mechanisms of antibody action and have a major impact on clinical medicine and public health by removing roadblocks to prevention and treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia with ideas and an approach that can be applied to any pathogen."
"9332001","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses rapidly accumulate mutations in antibody (Ab) binding sites within the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, a process termed 'antigenic drift'. Due to antigenic drift, humans are typically re-infected with distinct influenza strains. Although most humans are sequentially infected with different influenza strains over the course of their life, annual vaccine strains are chosen based on serological studies utilizing anti-sera prepared in ferrets recovering from a primary influenza infection. Accurate selections of vaccine strains are therefore based on the assumption that reference sera created in ferrets are representative of immunity found in the human population. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that influenza Ab specificities in humans are strongly influenced by previous influenza infections. This proposal will test the hypothesis that human influenza viruses evolve in response to Ab repertoires elicited by sequential influenza exposures, and that anti-sera prepared in ferrets fail to detect genuine antigenic changes that prevent binding of human Abs. In AIM 1 we will determine if recent pandemic H1N1 viruses have evolved to prevent binding of Abs elicited by sequential H1N1 exposures. For these studies, we will test if sera isolated from sequentially exposed ferrets and humans bind to pandemic H1N1 viruses engineered to possess new HA mutations that are now present in most circulating pandemic H1N1 strains. In AIM 2, we will determine how pre-exposure history influences Ab responses against H3N2 viruses. H3N2 viruses have circulated in the human population for 45 years, and the genetic and antigenic evolution of these viruses is well studied. We will sequentially infect mice and ferrets with different H3N2 strains and determine if Abs elicited in these animals recognize H3N2 viruses engineered to possess mutations that have arisen in distinct antigenic sites over the last 45 years. Finally, in AIM 3 we will determine how different pre-exposures affect vaccine responsiveness in infants. We will measure Ab specificities in sera from infants receiving 2 influenza vaccines from the same season (prime- boost with same antigen) and infants receiving 2 antigenically distinct influenza vaccines from different seasons (prime-boost with different antigenically distinct antigens). Together, these studies will further our understanding of the immunological pressures that promote antigenic drift of influenza viruses. These studies will shed light on why influenza vaccines elicit ineffectve responses in different individuals and will also improve the process by which vaccine strains are chosen."
"9240514","Cell entry and genome replication are two essential processes of any viral life cycle. The atomic details of these processes are largely unknown for large non-enveloped viruses, unlike enveloped viruses like flu, AIDS and herpes viruses. Upon cell entry, non-enveloped dsRNA viruses sense environmental changes for internal transcription activation. We have studied non-enveloped dsRNA viruses with a single-layered (cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus - CPV), a double-layered (aquareovirus), and a triple-layered (bluetongue virus ? or BTV ? a member of the Reoviridae family) capsid. Because of its well studied molecular biology and the existence of a reverse genetics system, BTV in particular serves as a good model system for studying cell entry and transcription by such viruses. Thus, the goal of this project is to use state-of-the-art cryo electron microscopy and tomography to determine the structural basis of dsRNA virus cell entry and genome transcription. Our results on BTV show that VP5 contains features similar to membrane fusion proteins and undergoes significant conformational changes at low pH to form a filamentous trimer structure. We hypothesize that this filamentous structure interacts and subsequently breaks endosomal membrane during cell entry. Using the simplest member (CPV) of the Reoviridae, we recently determined organization of dsRNA genome and transcriptional enzyme complex, and showed that RNA transcription activation is mediated by the SAM- dependent ATPase activity of its capping protein. This result, together with earlier observations in CPV and other members of the Reoviridae that RNA transcription activities were coupled with ATP hydrolysis (and more recently with viral ATPase activity), lead to our second hypothesis that the BTV capping protein (VP4) also contains an ATPase, which, triggered by the removal of outer shell, mediates activation of BTV RNA transcription. In Aim 1, we will incubate BTV virions and recombinant VP5 (wild-type and mutants) with liposomes at neutral and low pH and observe possible molecular interactions between viral particles and lipid membrane with cryo electron tomography (cryoET). Such direct structural data ? expected at nanometer resolution with phase plate and energy-filtering technologies and subtomogram averaging ? will test our first hypothesis and clarify whether and how VP5 penetrates liposomes. Aims 2-3 will test our hypothesis on the mechanism of RNA transcription. First, to clarify how VP5 detachment triggers conformational changes, we will determine the atomic structures of the BTV virion (pre-triggering, all transcription substrates) and cores (post- triggering: with only ATP or under transcribing condition) by icosahedral reconstruction (Aim 2). Second, to learn how these conformational changes lead to transcription activation, we will determine the atomic structures of transcriptional enzyme complex and dsRNA genome organization of cores (transcribing, ATP) and virions (all transcription substrates) by asymmetric reconstruction (Aim 3). These studies will be complemented by structure-based mutagenesis with our established method to obtain recombinant particles."
"9380365","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of my laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the development and function of the auditory sense organ and how inner ear defects cause hearing loss. We propose here to study the function of the Ig-superfamily member neuroplastin (Nptn) in the inner ear. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that Nptn regulates hair cell function and their interactions with sensory afferent neurons by mechanisms that are regulated by alternative splicing of the primary Nptn transcript. To test our hypothesis, we will: (i) determine the expression pattern and subcellular localization of Nptn isoforms in the inner ear; (ii) Study the consequences of inactivation of Nptn isoforms in hair cells and afferent neurons of the inner ear for hearing function; (iii) Determine the mechanisms by which Nptn isoforms carry out their function in hair cells and afferent neurons; (iv) determine the extent to which mutations in the gene encoding NPTN and its close homologues cause hearing impairment in humans. We anticipate that our findings will reveal novel insights into the mechanisms that regulate the function of hair cells and their innervating sensory afferent neurons, and how mutations in NPTN cause disease."
"9192141","Project Summary Nature uses vitamin B12 and its derivatives to perform fascinating chemical reactions that are essential for life. Enzymes that harness the reactivity of vitamin B12 are known for having dynamic transitions that move the co- factor between multiple sites in the protein. One such enzyme is the complex formed by the corrinoid iron-sul- fur protein and its methyltransferase (CFeSP/MeTr) from a microbial carbon ?xation pathway that is responsi- ble for producing an astounding 1012 kg of acetate annually. Microbes that utilize this pathway can be found in many contexts, including the human gut. Furthermore, a B12-dependent methyl transfer reaction is performed by the homologous enzyme methionine synthase (MetH) in humans to produce methionine from homocysteine. Prior studies of CFeSp/MeTr using X-ray crystallography suggest that large domain motions are an essential component of the enzyme turnover mechanism. Remarkably, enzyme turnover has been shown to occur within the crystal, and the motion of the B12 domain is the largest known for any protein in the crystalline state. We propose to develop new experimental and theoretical methods for X-ray scattering from MetH in solution and diffuse scattering from CFeSP/MeTr crystals to understand how long-ranged correlated motions in B12-depen- dent metalloenzymes regulate catalytic activity."
"9381264","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed three-year project will enhance our understanding of the link between school absences, school absences due to influenza like illness and influenza incidence in the wider community. Our proposal extends an existing set of projects that the co-Investigators of this proposal have conducted on influenza in school-children in the Pittsburgh area in the last 5 years. The Pittsburgh Influenza Prevention Project and the Social Mixing and Respiratory Transmission in Schools project have allowed us to fine tune surveillance systems for absenteeism and respiratory illness in the Pittsburgh area. We have conducted absentee surveillance and performed laboratory investigations of the viral etiology of respiratory illness in over 6000 children over 3 years as part of these two studies. We propose to conduct cause-specific school absence surveillance in three school districts including 11,000 students in and around Pittsburgh, PA. We will include multiple levels of surveillance including web-based surveys targeted broadly, closer follow-up and determination of viral etiology of respiratory infections in a subset of schools and close observation of a sentinel cohort of 250 school children each year. Drawing upon existing methodological work on time series and studies of spatial-temporal patterns of infectious disease, we will develop new statistical models of community metrics of influenza incidence using cause- specific school absence data and other covariates. We have been engaged in research and collaboration with the Allegheny County Health Department and the Pennsylvania Department of Health for several years in a study of influenza dynamics, county and state-wide. These partnerships have gained us access to disaggregate data on the appearance of influenza in the Allegheny county community. The intersection of experience conducting school-based influenza surveillance, developing novel statistical tools to study spatial-temporal dynamics of infectious diseases and long standing relationships with local public health authorities position us extremely well to succeed in this project. Dr. Derek Cummings is the Principal Investigator of this proposal, and each of the co-investigators has extensive experience working and collaborating with him on other research projects. Dr. Zimmer is an infectious disease clinician who has performed studies of the community transmission and burden of influenza in the 2009 pandemic and of influenza in interpandemic periods. Mr. Vukotich has extensive experience in public health project management stemming from 30 years of work at the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) as Assistant Deputy Director. We aim to develop protocols for conducting cause-specific school absence surveillance that can be transported to other populations, develop predictive models of the temporal course of influenza in communities and schools and develop novel statistical methods for prediction."
"9181416","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Community Action to Promote Healthy Environments (CA-PHE) builds on, and substantially extends, over 15 years of community-based participatory research by the involved partners to understand and address issues of air pollution and health in Detroit. Specifically, CA-PHE will engage community, academic and public health practice partners in research that will culminate in the development and implementation of a public health action plan that reduces exposure to air pollutants, mitigates adverse health effects, and provides additional health and environmental benefits. CA-PHE will increase knowledge about factors influencing exposure to air pollution and health effects, translate findings into a public health action plan, and implement campaigns, interventions and policies to reduce pollutant exposure and mitigate adverse health impacts. It will improve health outcomes and quality of life in vulnerable communities disproportionately at risk for cardiovascular and respiratory disease. The proposed project has five specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Strengthen, support and enhance the capacity of the community, academic and practice partners engaged in CA-PHE to work effectively together, and to conduct, understand and communicate effectively about the science of air pollution and human health; and of the CA-PHE Steering Committee to provide oversight for, and be actively engaged in, all aspects of the proposed research to action project. Specific Aim 2: Identify pollutant sources associated with adverse health outcomes, and examine strategies to mitigate these outcomes. Strategies to be examined will include the use of vegetative buffers to reduce impacts from pollutant sources (e.g., industry, highways) to occupied areas (e.g., residences, schools), an innovative and broadly applicable approach with many co-benefits (e.g., noise reduction, thermal cooling, watershed protection, recreation). Specific Aim 3. Develop a multilevel, integrated and scientifically informed public health action plan designed to reduce pollutant exposures and to mitigate their adverse health effects. The plan will be developed collaboratively, engaging individuals with a wide range of expertise (e.g., community organizing, planning, policy, public health, business) to evaluate existing evidence and to develop recommendations for short-, mid- and long- term strategies that reduce air pollution exposure and its negative effects on health. Specific Aim 4: Develop and implement campaigns, interventions and policies designed to promote the adoption and implementation of the public health action plan to reduce exposure and adverse effects on health. Efforts will be undertaken collaboratively by community, practice and academic partners, and designed to engage community residents, planners, community and business leaders, as well as public health and other local decision makers. Specific Aim 5: Conduct process and outcome evaluation of the development of the public health action plan, assess the effectiveness and impact of campaigns, interventions and policies carried out as part of the implementation of that plan, and assess the factors that influence the success of these action strategies."
"9265350","Abstract The 2015-2016 epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused severe unexpected clinical outcomes including microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. ZIKV is primarily a mosquito-transmitted virus but the concerns regarding sexual transmission has gained urgency as the alarming increase in the number of cases of microcephaly in ZIKV-infected women coincided with the detection of the virus in the semen. Association of ZIKV with hematospermia and presence of infectious ZIKV in the semen when viremia is undetectable in humans suggest the ability of ZIKV to establish infection in the testes. Lack of any vaccine or specific therapeutic drugs to combat ZIKV infection and prevent testicular infection has brought an urgent need for the development of in vitro systems and in vivo models to understand the associated mechanisms. Seminiferous tubules, the site of spermatogenesis within the testes, is an immune privileged site with an effective blood-testes barrier (BTB) that prevents microbial infections and protects immunogenic germ cells from systemic immune attack. The BTB, constituted exclusively by specialized tight junctions proteins (TJP) between the adjacent sertoli cells (SC) provides physical and immunological barrier to the seminiferous tubules. Increased production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-?, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cell-adhesion molecules (CAM) has been suggested to disrupt BTB and facilitate testicular infections. Although, compelling data from recent studies suggest that ZIKV has the ability to infect testes that may allow escape from immune detection, little is known about ZIKV infection of the testes. This proposal seeks to determine the mechanisms of ZIKV entry into the testes by utilizing an in vitro BTB model system using primary human SC and in vivo nonhuman primate model. We will address the hypothesis that to remain infectious in the testes even after the virus is cleared from the periphery, ZIKV infects SC and testes macrophages to induce inflammatory response that alters the expression of TJP, leading to BTB disruption and allowing entry of the virus into the seminiferous tubules thus establishing persistent infection in the testes. Our group is uniquely positioned to delineate the mechanisms of ZIKV testicular entry because of our previous experience of utilizing in vitro blood-brain barrier system and in vivo models to study WNV-neuroinvasion mechanisms. The specific aim 1 will determine how cell-free and macrophage-associated ZIKV transmigrates across the human in vitro BTB model and affects the barrier integrity. We will also assess if the induction of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, MMPs and CAM by ZIKV can affect expression of multiple TJP and BTB integrity. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate whether ZIKV affects the BTB integrity in the experimentally infected macaques and determine the relationship with persistence of virus and inflammatory and antiviral response in the testes. It is anticipated that the integration of data from the in vitro human system and highly relevant NHP model will fill the fundamental gap of the mechanism of ZIKV-testes entry and enhance our understanding of the specific immune response to testicular virus infection. Together this information may guide future strategies to manipulate the system for the development of novel approaches to eradicate virus from the testes."
"9237684","PROJECT SUMMARY In addition to traditional antimicrobials, targeting host defense pathways is an attractive strategy to limit the adverse effect of bacterial infection. One such pathway that has received considerable attention is autophagy, a process by which cellular constituents are sequestered in a double-membrane vesicle that is subsequently targeted to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy is suggested to be critical for cell autonomous defense because many bacterial pathogens are detected within double-membrane vesicles upon internalization. Therefore, it is possible that drugs that target autophagy will be useful in a wide range of diseases downstream of bacterial infections. However, in addition to a direct microbicidal mechanism, autophagy has many substrates and cell type-specific functions that may contribute to the outcome of an infection. Thus, we chose to re-examine the role of autophagy in vivo using two model pathogens ? Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. We chose to investigate S. Typhimurium because previous in vitro studies extensively demonstrated that this bacterium is targeted for degradation through autophagy. In contrast, in vitro experiments indicate that S. aureus uses the autophagy machinery for intracellular survival. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that inhibiting autophagy in vivo leads to the opposite outcome that is predicted by the literature. Specifically, autophagy mutants were protected from S. Typhimurium and susceptible to S. aureus. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the physiological mechanism by which autophagy functions during infection by these two important bacterial pathogens. In Aim 1, we will test a model in which S. Typhimurium recruits the autophagy machinery to repair the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and evade innate immune sensors. In Aim 2, we will define a novel role for autophagy in regulating the cell surface proteome of the host cells, a function that is critical in limiting damage caused by a pore-forming toxin produced by S. aureus. The results from the proposed experiments will challenge the existing paradigm on the role of autophagy in antimicrobial defense and guide the proper use of drugs that target autophagy."
"9123128","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemodialysis is the primary lifeline for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but arteriovenous graft (AVG) failure imposes significant morbidity, mortality, and financial dispositions 1,2,3. Stenosis at the venous anastomosis ultimately leads to compromised blood flow, necessitating vascular interventions4-6. Failure rates of 50% after 1 year and 75% after 2 years are reported in hemodialysis patients that utilize polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) dialysis grafts1. There is currently no effective treatment to prevent this failure. However, external mesh supports applied in other settings, such as to saphenous vein grafts in heart or peripheral bypass grafting surgeries, have been shown to inhibit neointimal formation9-15. These materials have not been applied in the hemodialysis setting because of geometric complexities at the venous anastomosis. We will develop a mechanically compliant, moldable external support6 that can be custom fit around a dialysis graft anastomosis to prevent neointimal formation. This device will also provide localized, sustained delivery of therapeutics with anti-neointimal effects. A potent anti-neointimal peptide inhibitor, MK2i (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase II), has demonstrated therapeutic potential in ex vivo human19 and in vivo mouse and rabbit vein interposition models22. We propose to use the moldable support system to deliver MK2i directly to the vein adventitia, thus maintaining higher drug concentrations with fewer toxicity concerns. Prevention of AVG failure in hemodialysis access patients represents an urgent, unmet clinical need. Amelioration of this problem would have a significant impact on clinical outcomes and economic repercussions of hemodialysis patients. This proposal offers a unique platform to advance adventitial drug delivery approaches and, if successful, could lead to therapeutic solutions in other clinical settings, such as coronary artery and peripheral bypass grafting surgeries."
"9260163","PROJECT ABSTRACT The 19th International Symposium on Infections in the Immunocompromised Host will be held in Santiago, Chile at the Hotel Sheraton San Cristóbal from November 13-15, 2016. The International Immunocompromised Host Society (ICHS) has successfully organized these Symposia for over 35 years. The ICHS Symposium is attended by close to 400 international delegates from over 40 countries with a goal of conveying the latest advances, treatments, and topics relevant to the immunocompromised host to a global audience. These year's topics include: antifungal therapy, new hepatitis antiviral treatments, advances in diagnostic tools, the impact of Zika virus on immunocompromised individuals, development of vaccines, update on current immunosuppresors, and biological agents.  Past support from the NIH for this conference has gone towards supporting the cost of travel for new investigators, trainees, women, and underrepresented individuals to attend. This conference promotes interactions between investigators from all over the world as well as young investigators with experienced investigators and research scientists with clinicians."
"9245834","Project Summary/Abstract Little is understood about the physiological or regulatory factors of Streptococcus pyogenes that enable switching between its commensal-like and virulent states. This proposal describes experimental approaches that seek to continue defining and characterizing quorum-sensing regulatory pathways that correspond to phenotypes consistent with the avirulent lifestyle of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus; GAS). The quorum sensing network in Streptococcus pyogenes utilizing short hydrophobic peptide (SHP) pheromones and the pheromone receptors Rgg2 and Rgg3 regulates several phenotypes, including biofilm development, cell aggregation, aminoglycoside susceptibility, and lysozyme resistance, by an unknown mechanism. Our studies indicate that each of these phenotypes depend upon the expression of a small protein of unknown function. We hypothesize that this protein, referred to as StcB, is an inhibitor of an enzyme(s) that targets peptidoglycan bonds of the cell wall. Additional studies indicate the target of StcB is a murein hydrolase enzyme, called Isp, that contains cysteine and histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) and acetylglucosaminidase domains. Governance of StcB and Isp by the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing pathway accounts for significant changes to the bacterial cell surface, resulting in differential attachment to fibronectin and epithelial cells, and differential immuno- modulatory activities. This proposal seeks to elucidate the mechanisms by which StcB and Isp enzymes account for biochemical changes to the surface of S. pyogenes, how these changes lead to differential activity of surface structures and proteins, and how these changes affect the ability of S. pyogenes to colonize the host and modulate immune activities."
"9264855","Project Summary Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was originally discovered in Uganda in 1947, and for nearly all of its history has been associated with mild self-limited illness. This changed during recent and ongoing ZIKV outbreaks in the South Pacific and Latin America, which have revealed new modes of transmission (i.e. sexual and in utero), as well as unexpected disease presentations (including birth defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome). These severe manifestations of ZIKV infection all involve the virus invading tissues that ordinarily are protected by anatomic barriers, including the central nervous system, the testes, and the fetal compartment. Understanding the viral and host factors that determine ZIKV tissue tropism is critical for evaluating the pathogenic potential of emerging ZIKV strains in new host environments. In this proposal, we will employ a new ZIKV reverse genetics system to experimentally test the hypothesis that genetic changes in the ZIKV strains currently circulating in Latin America confer enhanced virulence. In particular, we will focus on N-linked glycosylation in the virion envelope protein, as this is well-established as a virulence determinant in other flaviviruses and differs between contemporary outbreak strains of ZIKV and historical ones. Since novel tissue tropism may contribute to new manifestations of ZIKV infection, we will investigate the role of interferon lambda (IFN-?) in maintaining barriers to ZIKV tissue tropism, including the blood-brain barrier, placenta, and sertoli cell barrier, as has been shown previously for West Nile virus neuroinvasion. We will infect mice that lack the IFN-L receptor and compare ZIKV viral loads in the central nervous system, fetal compartment, testes, and eyes to tissues that are not protected by specialized barriers and to wild-type mice. Conversely, we will infect mice that lack the IFN-ab receptor, which develop high viral loads and tissue dissemination, with recombinant IFN-L protein and determine whether this results in barrier tightening and restriction of ZIKV invasion. As IFN-L protein has been used successfully in phase II clinical trials as a therapy for hepatitis C virus infection, this approach would provide a potential method to treat severe ZIKV infection. Altogether, our studies will reveal key viral and host determinants of ZIKV tissue tropism, key aspects of understanding the severe manifestations of ZIKV infection observed in the current outbreak in Latin America."
"9350905","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biodegradable nano- and microparticle technologies may offer safe, synergistic approaches for the multi-mode presentation of a vaccine antigen to the human immune system in a single formulation. Our proposal harnesses (1) the ability of virus-like nanoparticles to achieve a strong priming immune response, (2) the efficiency of biodegradable microparticles as slow-release natural boosting platforms, and (3) the capability of co-delivery of immunostimulatory agonists into a single platform for the development of the next generation of malaria transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs). TBVs are considered one of the critical tools in the global effort to eliminate and eradicate malaria, since they function to block mosquito transmission of both drug- resistant and susceptible parasites from one individual to another. However, TBVs suffer from the lack of natural boosting, as the target antigens themselves are only present inside the mosquito, and the recent mathematical models for implementation suggest that the ideal vaccine development goal is a single immunization approach that is capable of eliciting high titer antibodies for over at least one year, but preferably more. To circumvent these TBV as well as general vaccine development concerns, we propose to engineer a mixed mode nano-/microparticle delivery system that leverages different attributes of lymph node (LN)- targeting biodegradable nanoparticles for effective presentation of the TBV antigen, AnAPN1, to dendritic cells (DC) and biodegradable microparticles for sustained release of AnAPN1 antigen to permit continued boosting, therefore inducing a superior immune response in the vaccinated individual. For our initial studies in a rodent model, we will develop size-controlled biodegradable LN-targeting nanoparticles for effective delivery and presentation of the AnAPN1 antigen to LN-resident DCs, followed by functional characterization of the AnAPN1-specific immune response. We will then engineer DC-activating nanoparticles to potentiate the antibody response to co-delivered AnAPN1 antigen followed by characterization of the effect of nanoparticle- delivered adjuvant on the functional AnAPN1-specific immune response. Lastly, we will construct a single-dose vaccine with DC-targeting biodegradable nanoparticles and AnAPN1-releasing microparticles and assess the durability and transmission-blocking efficacy of AnAPN1-specific antibodies in a large animal model."

"9335098","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol have long been recognized as important determinants of cardiovascular disease risk. Among a large number of factors involved, three members of the vascular lipase protein family stand out as critical players in plasma lipid homeostasis. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a principal determinant of plasma TG concentration, whereas hepatic lipase (HL) and endothelial lipase (EL) are primarily involved in the metabolism of HDL-cholesterol. Whereas the regulation of these enzymes by extracellular factors has long been appreciated, post-translational processing within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has recently emerged as an important intracellular pathway affecting the expression of active lipases and plasma lipid homeostasis. Using genetic approaches in mouse models, we identified the lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) and suppressor/enhancer of Lin-12-like (SEL1L) genes as critical players in the post-translational maturation and secretion of active lipases. Mutations in LMF1 cause combined lipase deficiency and hypertriglyceridemia in mice and humans, whereas a genetic defect in SEL1L leads to impaired LPL secretion from adipose tissue and elevated plasma TG levels in a mouse model. Although these studies implicate LMF1 and SEL1L in lipase biogenesis and lipid homeostasis, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain uncharacterized. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the molecular role of LMF1 in the folding and assembly of active lipases within the ER and investigate its interaction with the general chaperone, calnexin (CNX). In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the role of SEL1L in the release of lipases from the ER and investigate functional and structural aspects of a molecular complex between CNX, LMF1 and SEL1L in the coordination of lipase maturation and secretion. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate LMF1 as a genetic determinant of dyslipidemia in humans through the functional characterization of coding variants recently discovered in hypertriglyceridemic populations. Our studies will contribute to a better understanding of the post-translational processing of vascular lipases, and the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperlipidemia."
"9383133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR project aims to preclinically characterize an innovative and proprietary botanical product targeting chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our objective is to provide experimental support for the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory isothiocyanates (ITCs) naturally produced in the edible leaves of Moringa oleifera Lam. (moringa) after mechanical wounding provide stable, highly efficacious and practical alternatives to instable and volatile ITCs produced by plants of the crucifer family (Brassicaceae), such as broccoli. Moringa leaves are historically used as a nutritious food and traditional medicine throughout South Asia and Africa. They contain high levels of nutrients, vitamins, and beneficial phytoactives. These phytoactives include unique, sugar-modified aromatic glucosinolates that can be converted to bioactive and stable moringa isothiocyanates (MICs) in wounded leaves. We have developed a novel, simple and proprietary aqueous extraction/biotransformation method, which effectively converts moringa glucosinolates into MICs resulting in good-tasting, shelf-stable, food-grade, moringa concentrate (MC) containing at least 3% of MICs. Preliminary studies have shown that MICs equal or exceed the bioactivity of sulforaphane, a well-known ITC from broccoli. Both MC and MICs strongly reduced the expression and levels of inflammatory markers, such as iNOS, IL- 1ß, and TNF? in in vitro models as well TNF? levels in intestinal tissue and feces of mice fed a high fat diet. The proposed work, carried out in close collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Ilya Raskin of Rutgers University (a leading expert in botanicals and inflammation) and three consultants, experienced in various aspects of natural products and IBD, will assess bioavailability and toxicology of MICs delivered in MC. We will further investigate anti-inflammatory effects of MC and MICs in an in vitro Caco-2 cell model with the goal of elucidating the mechanism of action of MICs and study the effects of MC in the dextran sodium-sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse model of acute and chronic ulcerative colitis. Finally, we will investigate and compare MIC content of various moringa cultivars growing in diverse climatic and geographic regions and define and optimize commercial scale MC manufacturing methods, such as wounding, residue removal and drying."
"9377521","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The concept of a layered immune system entails the generation of specific functional components of the immune system at different stages of development. Despite three decades of research, the cellular mechanisms underlying immune layering have remained elusive. Our lab recently identified the cellular mechanism contributing to immune layering. Using a lineage tracing mouse model thoroughly characterized in our laboratory, we discovered a developmentally limited hematopoietic stem (HSC) that gives rise to developmentally restricted innate-like immune cells. These innate-like immune cells are critical mediators of immune tolerance and autoimmunity. Building on this discovery, my research interests focus on determining the developmental mechanisms underlying the establishment of immune tolerance and autoimmune susceptibility. I aim to define the unique function of this novel hematopoietic stem cell population in establishing innate immunity during development. I then seek to define the specific phenotypic, functional, and genetic attribute of immune cells generated from a developmentally-restricted HSC. Lastly, I aim to determine the effect of perinatal immune insult on developmental hematopoiesis, immune development and autoimmune disease susceptibility. This work will be conducted in the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells at UC Santa Cruz in the lab of Dr. Camilla Forsberg, an expert in hematopoietic stem cell biology. Over the course of my doctoral training in nutritional sciences and my postdoctoral training in hematopoietic stem cell biology, I have gained considerable technical and intellectual breadth in developmental, molecular, and cell biology. My immediate goal is to broaden my training within immunology, including coursework, collaboration with expert immunology labs at UC San Francisco, and guidance by my co-mentor, Dr. Robert Coffman, a renowned expert in innate immunology. My long-term goal is to establish an innovative, independent research program at the interface of development, hematopoiesis and immunology."
"9031061","Measures of structure and strength are essential when assessing functional outcomes in animal models  related to musculoskeletal biology and medicine. In 2008, evaluation of these outcomes at Washington  University (WU) was limited to a handful of investigators because we lacked a formal support structure.  Evaluating these outcomes requires specialized equipment and expertise, which is impractical and inefficient  to recreate in multiple labs. In response to this unmet need, we established the Musculoskeletal Structure  and Strength Core. This multifaceted resource supports our 75-member Research Base in understanding  and implementing techniques to evaluate structure and mechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues  (e.g., bone, tendon, muscle) derived from animal models. Since 2009, we have provided billable services to  59 investigators, who have reported structure or strength data in 68 manuscripts to date. We have presented  seminars and developed online resources to advance understanding and promote best practices. We have  invested in new approaches to enhance our capabilities. Finally, we moved and consolidated our major  resources into a single floor of the new WU Musculoskeletal Research Center. To sustain and extend these  accomplishments, we propose five objectives: 1) support cost-effective utilization of existing resources for  densitometry, imaging, and mechanical testing; 2) maintain expert oversight and quality control; 3) provide  training and enrichment opportunities (in concert with the T32 Washington University Metabolic Skeletal  Disorders Training Program); 4) enhance Core capabilities through development of new techniques; and 5)  foster new interactions and enhance existing interactions between members of the Research Base of the  Core Center for Musculoskeletal Biology and Medicine (CCMBM). In summary, Core B will provide critical  support to members of the Research Base to enable cost-effective utilization of methods to quantify  morphology and mechanical properties from musculoskeletal tissues. Through our efforts we will enhance  research productivity and provide access to state-of-the-art and emerging techniques."
"9229418","Apicomplexan parasites include a number of pathogens of medical and veterinary importance and our long- term goal is to identify novel molecules and pathways in these microorganisms that could be targets for chemotherapy, diagnostic applications, or vaccines.  Many of these parasites rely for their survival on biosynthetic pathways that occur in a remnant plastid known as the apicoplast. A large number of these anabolic pathways are essential for the life of the parasite. Our laboratory recently found a two-pore channel (TPC) that localizes to the apicoplast membrane(s) and is essential for growth of Toxoplasma gondii. Two-pore channels belong to the superfamily of voltage-gated ion channels and are characterized by the presence of two sets of six-transmembrane domains (TMDs). This was an important discovery because it exposed a completely untapped question, which is the role of ions like Ca2+ on the activity of essential anabolic enzymes of the organelle and how this impacts parasite fitness. In addition, and more importantly, ion channels are targets of many therapeutically useful agents and they remain significantly under-exploited as therapeutic targets, even more so as antiparasitic agents.  The apicoplast, the product of a secondary endosymbiosis process, is an organelle surrounded by membranes derived from the cyanobacterium that gave origin to the plastid, the endosymbiotic alga, and the host endosomal compartment. Metal ions play essential roles for the activity of more than one third of all enzymes and considering the large number of essential activities present in the apicoplast, it is likely that ions will be highly regulated in the organelle. No ion transporters or channels have been reported in the apicoplast until now.  This makes our recent discovery of a two-pore channel localized to the apicoplast a unique finding and also an unexpected opportunity for the development of new therapies. TPCs are found in both animal and plant cells where they localize to acidic organelles such as endosomes, lysosomes and vacuoles. TPCs function as Ca2+ channels in mammalian cells and are activated by the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). The Toxoplasma TPC localization to the plastid is unique to Apicomplexa and highlights a novel and potentially specific role for the organelle multiple functions.  We silenced the T. gondii TgTPC gene and found that the mutants display a severe growth defect that can be rescued by complementation with a functional channel. Our hypothesis is that the TPC is a non-selective channel that upon voltage gating is able to conduct cations but in the environment of the cell it probably prefers Ca2+. This hypothesis implies that the apicoplast contains Ca2+, an idea supported by preliminary evidence. We propose a model in which the apicoplast through the TPC and Ca2+ communicates with other organelles via other potential Ca2+ channels. Two other candidate Ca2+ channels will be studied.  Our goal is to define the physiological function of TgTPC using sophisticated biophysical approaches in the context of several model systems. We will combine this with live cell studies to determine how their activity influences the physiology of the apicoplast and other intracellular organelles and the fitness of the parasite."
"9171380","Project 3 (P3). Noncanonical activities of a tRNA synthetase in metabolism and atherosclerosis Paul L. Fox, Ph.D., Project Leader Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of Project 3 is to understand the noncanonical function of an extraordinary tRNA synthetase, the Glu-Pro tRNA synthetase or EPRS, in diet-induced obesity and consequent cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis. The recent explosive epidemic of obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease has begun an unprecedented decline in the health-span of adults in the U.S., and likewise threatens an equally unprecedented economic burden. In 1942, James Neel suggested a possible rationale for the genetic selection of genes causing these pathologies. He posited that metabolic pathways were naturally selected to efficiently store fat and carbohydrate during periods of food scarcity; however, the same genes and pathways are detrimental during periods of plentiful, calorie-rich food supply as in the Western world today. A kinase cascade involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) is implicated as a key metabolic pathway regulating food utilization, and is conserved from Drosophila to humans. Despite intense study, the key downstream effector(s) of mTORC1-S6K1, and consequent cell mechanisms that regulate metabolism remains unknown. During the previous Project period, we made fundamental in vitro and in vivo discoveries that revealed phosphorylated EPRS as a key downstream effector of mTORC1-S6K1, regulating post-transcriptional, inflammation-related pathways in macrophages and metabolic pathways in adipocytes. Inflammatory macrophages permeate the more abundant adipocytes in adipose tissue of obese subjects, and EPRS phosphorylation in both cell types by S6K1 might functionally couple these cells, and contribute importantly to obesity-associated cardiovascular disease. To test the role of phospho-EPRS in these processes we have generated genetically-modified EPRS phospho-deficient and phospho-mimetic knock-in mice. Preliminary studies show that phospho-deficient EPRS mice phenocopy S6K1-null mice, e.g., small size and low fat mass, and will permit rigorous investigation of the role of EPRS in mTORC1-S6K1-driven mechanisms in vivo. We propose to test the following hypothesis: Phospho-EPRS is a critical effector of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in both adipocytes and macrophages, and contributes importantly to diet- induced obesity and atherosclerosis. Our discovery that EPRS is a key mTORC1-S6K1 effector activated by agonists of both inflammation and metabolism provides a molecular link between these processes. We anticipate our studies will reveal new mechanisms underlying obesity and atherosclerosis, and can provide novel therapeutic targets for treatment of these related disorders."
"9031062","Full utilization of model organisms requires direct analysis of relevant tissues with histological sections.  Analysis of tissues in the musculoskeletal system is technically challenging due to the nature of the tissues  involved, which requires specialized techniques and anatomical knowledge to obtain the necessary sections.  The creation of Core C has provided the technical and advisory resources and the operational structure to  enable our research base to take full advantage of histology-based techniques, and has greatly enhanced  the research programs of our investigators in the Core Center for Musculoskeletal Biology and Medicine.  A large number of specific histochemical stains, as well as in situ identification of mRNA and proteins, can be  employed to provide a detailed picture of developmental or pathophysiological events in our models. The  overall objective of the Core is to provide histological services for the identification and analysis of molecular  phenotypes of our target tissues - bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon and ligament - in an array of model  organisms. Although the bulk of the work submitted by our user base comes from genetically modified mice,  we also aim to facilitate histological analysis of other organisms including rat, rabbit, dog and zebrafish, as  well as human samples. The services to be offered include tissue processing (paraffin, methylmethacrylate,  and frozen), sectioning, and staining with an array of techniques. We also provide consultation for project  planning and data analysis, and training for users in sectioning, in situ mRNA hybridization,  immunohistochemistry, and quantitative histomorphometry. Finally, the Core provides the entire user base  with education on appropriate methods for experimental design and data analysis related to all Core  services. The strength of the Core lies in our expert staff, quality control, and close communication with  investigators at all stages of their projects to ensure optimal histology-based analysis. In its first 4 years of  operation, the Core has adapted to the needs of its investigator base, and this will be continued in the future  as it is critical to our success. Importantly, this Core complements the specific functional analyses proposed  in Core B and the new animal models generated by Core D."

"9260454","The diarrheal disease cholera poses enormous health, economic, and political burdens worldwide. The causative agent of cholera, Vibrio cholerae, is endemic in aquatic habitats, but it is capable of infecting the human small intestine, causing a massive, life-threatening diarrheal response. To colonize the host and cause disease, V. cholerae must acquire essential nutrients, including iron, in the host environment. The predominant form of iron present in the small intestine is ferrous iron. Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of ferrous iron uptake in V. cholerae. The major ferrous iron transporter in V. cholerae is Feo. The Feo system is widely distributed among all bacterial species, and has important functions in the virulence of several pathogenic species; nevertheless, very little is known about its structure and mechanism of transport. In V. cholerae, the Feo transporter is composed of three proteins, FeoA, FeoB, and FeoC. The membrane-embedded C-terminal domain of FeoB is likely to form the pore for iron transport, and, interestingly, its N-terminal domain has homology to small eukaryotic G proteins, suggesting a novel mechanism of transport. The roles of FeoA and FeoC are unknown. We recently demonstrated that the three Feo proteins associate to form a higher order complex in vivo. This represents the first structural analysis of the mature, membrane- embedded, active Feo complex in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to determine the overall structure of this large complex in order to build and test models for the mechanism of iron transport. In our first specific aim, we will determine the mass and stoichiometry of the native Feo complex. This will lay the groundwork for a structural model of the active Feo transporter. In aim 2, we will refine this model by delineating the sites of interaction within and between the members of the complex. We will then test the functional significance of these interactions for complex formation and iron transport activity. In aim 3, we will determine the source of energy for transport through Feo. These studies will significantly advance our knowledge of the structure and function of this important and unique iron transporter. Significantly, all our studies will be carried out using active, membrane-associated Feo complexes in vivo, giving our results an undeniable relevance over the in vitro studies that currently dominate the Feo field. As our previous work shows, V. cholerae is an ideal model organism for the study of Feo. We have already assembled most of the strains and reagents needed, and we, and our collaborators, have the expertise required to carry out the proposed experiments."
"9285141","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSR) domains play essential roles in gliding motility, host-cell recognition and invasion throughout the life cycle o the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. These domains are present in proteins that are particularly important during parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes and back. The aim of this project is to explore and characterize the O- fucosylation of TSR domains of critical P. falciparum molecules. As it has been described across diverse organisms, TSR domains are commonly fucosylated by the protein-O-fucosyltransferase 2 (PoFUT2) and this modification is required for optimal folding and secretion of TSR-containing proteins. Furthermore, the O-fucosylation consensus sequence on TSR domains coincides with its ligand-binding motif, suggesting that O-fucose may alter ligand-binding affinities of TSR-domains. A PoFUT2 homolog is conserved and expressed by P. falciparum, and GDP-fucose, the substrate donor of O-fucosylation reactions, is actively synthesized and incorporated by the parasite. Together with the detection of the O-fucosylation machinery in salivary gland sporozoites by proteomic analyses, the evidence strongly point to the conservation of a PoFUT2 mediated O-fucosylation mechanism in P. falciparum. We propose to (1) explore these putative posttranslational modifications by characterizing two endogenously expressed and essential TSR-containing proteins in the ookinete and sporozoite stages (the Circumsporozoite and TRAP-related protein, CTRP; and the Circumsporozoite protein, CS, respectively) and (2) evaluate the biological significance of TSR modification by phenotyping O- fucosylation null mutants in the ookinete and sporozoite stages. TSR domains are essential for host- parasite interactions in malaria. A deeper insight into a mechanism of posttranslational modification of P. falciparum TSR will ultimately lay the foundation for future exploration into the fundamental role of glycosylation in malaria parasite biology."
"9171375","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids in the artery wall, and is an inflammatory disease in which several immune effectors including macrophages play a central role. Obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia are all major risk factors for CVD, but the mechanisms that link disordered metabolism to inflammation and the development of atherosclerosis remain to be elucidated. Our published work and preliminary data demonstrate that the double stranded RNA activated protein kinase, PKR, is activated in the context of obesity, where it plays a critica role in driving inflammation and the deterioration of glucose homeostasis. In macrophages, exposure to lipotoxic signals and lipoproteins activate PKR. In addition, PKR is a critical component for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and stress signaling pathways such as JNK, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of both diabetes and atherosclerosis. In addition, in supporting data presented in this proposal we demonstrate a significant protection against atherosclerotic plaque development in PKR-deficient mice. Based on these findings our overarching hypothesis is that by modulating inflammatory activity, insulin action, and protein synthesis, PKR links cellular stress and metabolic signals to chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis. The experiments described in this proposal will test that hypothesis by determining the role of PKR in the activation and function of macrophages, and by assessing the whole body and macrophage-specific requirement for PKR in the development of atherosclerosis in vivo. This contribution will expand our understanding of the link between nutrient stress and the development of cardiometabolic disease. The innovation of this work lies in investigating a novel approach to atherosclerosis therapy by identifying the mechanistic link between dyslipidemia and inflammatory activation of immune cells."
"9171370","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dyslipidemia and the oxidative stress associated with it are among the main risk factors leading to atherothrombosis. Platelet activation plays a key role in atherothrombosis and the subsequent acute coronary syndromes triggered by plaque rupture. Many dyslipidemia- related pathophysiological states are associated with a drastically increased response of platelets to agonists. While the significance of increased platelet reactivity in the pathophysiology of occlusive arterial thrombosis is widely recognized, knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced platelet reactivity in vivo during hyperlipidemia has only started to emerge. Involvement of platelet pattern recognition receptors in platelet function has been recently appreciated. We have previously demonstrated that the platelet scavenger receptor CD36 serves as the platelet sensor for oxidative stress and promotes platelet hyperreactivity in dyslipidemia. Recently, we and others have demonstrated that TLRs, another family of pattern recognition receptors with previously unknown role in platelets, can regulate platelet function. Our recent data demonstrate that platelet TLR1/TLR2 and TLR9, alone or in collaboration with CD36, recognize novel altered-self ligands that accumulate in the circulation during oxidative stress and dyslipidemia. Ligation of these receptors activates pathways common to the innate immunity system, and connects this signaling to the integrin activation network in platelets via links that have not yet been established. Generation of biologically-active oxidized lipids and related products is a critical consequence of oxidative stress. According to our studies these molecules represent altered self ligands for platelet pattern recognition receptors. We have previously identified a novel family of oxidized choline glycerophospholipids (oxPCCD36) that serve as high affinity ligands for CD36 and promote platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis in vivo via CD36. Our recent studies extended this observation to a novel class of products formed via degradation of oxPCCD36 by PLA2. We showed that carboxyalkylpyrrole adducts of proteins and phosphatidylethanolamine are novel ligands for platelet TLRs, are powerful platelet agonists and accumulate in vivo in dyslipidemia. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of receptor recognition, the contribution to thrombosis in vivo of novel ligands and the signaling pathways they induce in platelets are not known. This proposal will address the hypothesis that platelet TLRs, alone or in cooperation with CD36, promote platelet reactivity and the prothrombotic state induced by endogenous ligands generated during oxidative stress."
"9175485","ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify ?cariogenic profiles,? in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6."
"9136640","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that function as powerful regulators of gene networks. Although they were classically thought to function only within the cell, strikingly stable populations of extracellular microRNAs (ex-miRNAs) have been discovered in a variety of body fluids. Because their profile in serum is altered in many cancers such as prostate cancer, ex-miRNAs hold promise as a tool for cancer detection and treatment prognosis. Additionally, many studies are revealing a possible biological utility for ex- miRNAs shuttled between cells in extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, as mediators of paracrine signaling. Despite growing interest in the function of secreted ex-miRNAs and their clinical application as biomarkers for cancer, we still lack understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ex-miRNA packaging and secretion. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the steps of selection for miRNAs during packaging and secretion via exosomes and determine how oncogenic stimuli can affect these mechanisms. I hypothesize that selective miRNA secretion is controlled by selective multivesicular body release and mechanisms of intraluminal vesicle formation, both of which are modulated by oncogenic signaling. These studies will shed light on the biological implication of ex-miRNAs in paracrine signaling and further our understanding of how to utilize them as novel biomarkers for cancer. This research project is crafted to facilitate my development into a versatile scientist capable of becoming a leader in academia. To achieve this goal, my training plan will help me advance my skills in biochemistry, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. My instruction will also be supported by coursework in cancer biology, ethics, and statistics/data analysis. I will further my career development by improving my communication and writing skills directly from my sponsor and other mentors, as well as taking advantage of classes and seminars offered at UCSF. The resources and mentorship afforded to me in this setting will give me the best opportunity to achieve my goal of leading an independent laboratory in the future."
"9059663","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposed CTDD program will help translate the enormous resource of high- throughput cancer genome characterizations into functionally validated, cancer-genotype based therapeutic targets. Over the past several years, members of this project have developed powerful tools and strategies for functionally annotating cancer genomes. These have enabled the identification and validation over fifty cancer genes, several of which are compelling therapeutic targets. Here, we propose to synthesize and optimize those strategies into a unified blueprint that can be applied across many tumor types. At the core of our philosophy is the use of powerful computational tools to narrow the extent of the genome that must be surveyed functionally. This enables the use of more precise human and mouse models to assess drivers and dependencies and approaches to combinatorial interactions that could not be carried out on a genome wide scale. We will apply these tools to select cancer types and gene sets in order to identify new oncogenic drivers, genotype-specific cancer dependencies, and to test strategies for the systematic identification of targets for combination therapies. We envision the impact of our project not only as the identification of genomically informed targets for several tumor types but also as providing tools and strategies that can be used throughout the consortium and the community."
"9339804","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza viruses rapidly accumulate mutations in antibody (Ab) binding sites within the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, a process termed 'antigenic drift'. Due to antigenic drift, humans are frequently re-infected with antigenically distinct influenza strains and vaccines must be updated frequently. Influenza vaccines fail to elicit protective Ab responses in some individuals, even when vaccine strains are well matched to predominant circulating strains. Elderly individuals, who typically have extensive influenza exposure histories, respond particularly poorly to influenza vaccines. As early as the 1950's, it was noted that the human immune system preferentially mounts Ab responses to previously circulating influenza strains, as opposed to new Ab responses that exclusively target newer viral strains. This process, termed 'original antigenic sin (OAS)', has been proposed to contribute to vaccine failures in individuals with extensive influenza pre-exposure histories. We hypothesize that strain-specific Abs that recognize variable epitopes located on the top of HA are more efficient at neutralizing virus compared to OAS-induced Abs that recognize epitopes in conserved regions of HA. Previous studies of OAS have utilized influenza strains that have dramatic antigenic differences, however humans are more typically sequentially infected or vaccinated with influenza strains that have subtle antigenic changes compared to previously circulating strains. In this proposal, we will determine if OAS is induced by sequential infections with seasonal influenza strains with moderate antigenic differences. We will sequentially infect mice and ferrets with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 viruses with well defined HA antigenic mutations, and we will identify OAS-induced Abs through hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI), ELISA, ELISPOT, FACS-based Ab binding, and in vitro neutralization assays. We will complete similar vaccination experiments in pre-exposed animals with and without the MF59 adjuvant. We will then map the precise binding footprints of anti-HA mAbs derived from mice sequentially infected with distinct influenza strains. We will also map the binding footprints of a large panel of H3N2 mAbs derived from vaccinated humans with different H3N2 pre- exposure histories. Finally, we will determine in vivo neutralization efficiencies of OAS-induced murine and human mAbs using a mouse model. Collectively, these studies will determine (1) if seasonal vaccines induce OAS, (2) if OAS contributes to decreased vaccine efficacy in pre-exposed populations, and (3) if OAS Ab repertoires can be altered by MF59 adjuvants."
"9191515","Project Summary Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States with a 1 in 8 lifetime risk for most women. It also ranks second highest in cancer related mortality. Nearly 75% of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases are estrogen receptor (ER) and often progesterone receptor (PR) positive and therefore treated using targeted endocrine therapies such as Tamoxifen (Tam) and Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs). Unfortunately 40% of patients with ER+ breast cancer will acquire resistance to these therapies and have a tumor recurrence. While the role of estrogen in breast cancer has been extensively studied, the role of PR has been largely overlooked. Activation of PR via progestins in hormone replacement therapy has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer in post-menopausal women. It has been theorized that this may be due to expansion of the stem cell populations in the normal breast, which are expanded in response to progestins and are more susceptible to transformation. In the normal breast, these stem and progenitor cell populations expanded by progesterone are marked by expression of cytokeratin 5 (CK5). Similarly, the Sartorius laboratory found that in ER+/PR+ breast cancer cell lines, progesterone can expand the CK5 expressing cell population, which has been shown to mark a cancer stem cell (CSC) population in these ER+/PR+ cell lines. The lab also found that this CK5 expressing population is more tumorigenic both in vitro and in vivo, and more resistant to chemo- and endocrine therapies. A small molecule screen performed by the lab determined that select retinoids, including retinoic acid (RA), are able to prevent the induction of CK5 seen following P4 treatment of breast cancer cells. It is not known, however, how RA is able to prevent the induction of CK5 or whether the expression of CK5 is necessary to confer these cancer stem cell-like properties. The studies proposed here will unravel the mechanism by which hormones positively or negatively regulate a CSC population within ER+PR+ breast cancer, and have the potential to identify a means to target this CSC population with the ultimate goal of reducing recurrence and improving the outcome of this disease."
"9171378","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Atherosclerotic vascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States with the majority of mortality due to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Risk factor modification such as reductions in hyperlipidemia constitutes the only treatment strategy available for this vexing disease. Thus, there is an active effort to identify the culprit cellular processes that provide mechanistic insight. Recent reports f the proatherogenic phenotype of mice with a macrophage-specific autophagy deficiency has renewed interest in the role of the autophagy-lysosomal system in atherosclerosis. Lysosomes have the unique role of processing both exogenous material such as excess atherogenic lipids and endogenous cargo that includes dysfunctional proteins and organelles. Since little is known about the effect of an atherogenic environment on macrophage lysosomes, we aimed to test the notion that lysosomal dysfunction is the product of lipid metabolism and evaluate novel ways to ameliorate this effect. Our preliminary data demonstrate that macrophages develop features of lysosome dysfunction upon exposure to atherogenic lipids. In turn, this lysosomal stress can activate TFEB, the only known transcription factor that can broadly stimulate lysosomal biogenesis and function. The regulation of macrophage TFEB appears to be critically linked to mTOR signaling, buttressed by the observation that the classic mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin can induce lysosomal biogenesis while reducing macrophage dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Understanding the links between lipid metabolism and lysosomal biogenesis has important implications in understanding plaque progression. We propose to test the hypothesis that macrophage lysosomal biogenesis mediated by the transcription factor TFEB is an important compensatory response during atherosclerosis and serves an atheroprotective role. A variety of mouse models capable of dissecting the role of TFEB action in macrophages will serve as the research tools to address this hypothesis both in vitro and in vivo."
"9355771","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translocation of gut microbes following CD4+ T cell depletion in acute HIV infection has been implicated as a potential mechanism for immune activation in chronic HIV-1 infection and a hallmark for HIV disease progression. Interestingly, HIV patients that use intravenous heroin have higher bacterial loads when compared to non-drug using HIV infected patients. However, the mechanism underlying this defect has not been well studied. We show in preliminary data, in a murine model of drug abuse, significant increase in gut bacterial translocation in morphine treated animals when compared to placebo treated animals, which is further exacerbated in the TATtg mice treated with morphine. Strategic localization and expression of Toll-like- receptors (TLRs), on intestinal epithelial cells prevents excessive activation by gut commensal bacterial and promotes secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the gut lumen. However, dysregulated TLR activation results in barrier dysfunction, sustained bacterial translocation and chronic systemic immune activation. We show in preliminary data that morphine treatment results in a significant increase in both TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein levels in gut epithelial cells and morphine induced increase in bacterial translocation is significantly attenuated in TLR2KO and TLR2/4 double knockout mice. Based on our preliminary results we hypothesize that morphine modulation of TLR expression and distribution on intestinal epithelial cells (IEL) results in tight junction proteins disruption leaing to increased bacterial translocation. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize, that morphine induced activation of TLRs on IEC contributes to gut barrier disruption leading to increased bacterial translocation. We further hypothesize that HIV-protein TAT will further exacerbate the pathological state. In Aim 1: We will determine that morphine treatment and morphine treatment in the context of HIV-1 TAT results in dysregulated TLR2 and 4 expression, aberrant TLR2 and 4 localization and persistent activation contributing to barrier disruption and gut bacterial translocation. Aim 2: We will determine the mechanisms how TLR expression and activation by morphine and morphine in the context of HIV 1 TAT disrupts tight junction protein organization and function. In Aim 3: we will determine the therapeutic potential of methylnaltrexone in the presence of Chloroquine in mitigating morphine and HIV-1 TAT modulation of gut barrier function. The results from these studies will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies to attenuate immune activation and reverse HIV disease progression both in HIV infected patients and in HIV infected drug abusing population."

Jonathan Smith, Ph.D., Core Leader Project Summary/Abstract The Lipoprotein analysis portion of this Core's primary objective is to analyze lipid and lipoprotein levels in various mouse models produced by projects and to provide human lipoproteins as needed. Mouse lipoprotein analysis will be accomplished using two methods, one based on separation of HDL-C from non-HDL-C via ultracentrifugation or precipitation, and the other based on size exclusion chromatography by FPLC. The Atherosclerosis portion of this Core's primary objective is to train investigators how to sacrifice mice and prepare tissues for atherosclerosis assays, and to offer two separate quantitative atherosclerosis assays; 1) cross sectional lesion area at the aortic root, and 2) cross sectional brachiocephalic lesion area. We can also assist Project personnel by teaching them the assay of surface lesion area on en face preparations of the entire aorta. Standardization of the lipoprotein assays and atherosclerosis assays will facilitate inter-laboratory collaboration and data comparisons. In addition, the Core will relieve the individual laboratories from having to learn and perform the laborious assays for atherosclerosis quantification."
"9171384","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly recurrent, disabling illness, and emerging data indicate that, for women with BD, the perinatal period is particularly destabilizing. Prospective studies have revealed mood episode morbidity in up to 70% of pregnant women with the disorder, and risk of postpartum mania in as high as 50% of cases. Negative sequelae of BD for expectant and new mothers include severe psychosocial impairment, substantial suicide risk, and rates of postpartum psychosis 100 times greater than in the general public. Moreover, infants of pregnant women with BD are significantly more likely to experience adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, small for gestational age, and microcephaly. Despite these risks, as well as expert recommendations for prophylactic mood stabilization at a minimum effective dose throughout the perinatal period, rates of medication discontinuation are as high as 70% among pregnant and postpartum women with BD. Thus, a critical need exists to find ways to increase appropriate treatment engagement among perinatal women with BD. As a first step toward developing interventions that attempt to increase treatment engagement, it is important to understand factors that limit effective treatment utilization. The proposed study would be the first to examine these questions, integrating quantitative and qualitative methods to elucidate the processes by which perinatal women choose to continue or discontinue BD pharmacotherapy. Eighty pregnant women with BD, half of whom recently discontinued their BD pharmacotherapy, will complete assessments during pregnancy and again at three months postpartum that assess medication utilization, BD symptoms, treatment attitudes, and illness-related cognitions. A subset of the overall sample (n=24) will take part in a qualitative interview to obtain more in-depth information regarding women's treatment decisions regarding perinatal BD care. Women's medication providers (n=up to 80) will also be assessed. The three primary aims of this study are: (1) To test the hypothesis that women's illness-related cognitions account for unique variance in medication continuation decisions, over and above clinical characteristics and treatment attitudes; (2) To utilize qualitative measures to further explore the decision-making process and develop a model reflecting the relative contribution of factors influencing medication continuation decisions; (3) To integrate findings from both quantitative and qualitative phases of the research to develop specific recommendations regarding optimal decision support strategies for women and providers. On an exploratory level (4), this study aims to examine associations between prenatal pharmacotherapy continuation and subsequent treatment decisions and maternal symptom, functioning, and birth outcomes at three months postpartum. Ultimately, this project will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of why perinatal women with BD often discontinue pharmacotherapy, as well as specific recommendations for future interventions, such as prenatal decision support strategies, to address this serious problem."
"9328538","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type II taste cells, which respond to sweet, bitter and umami tastants lack morphologically defined synapses. Instead, these taste cells utilize depolarization-evoked non-vesicular ATP release to communicate with afferent gustatory nerves. The overarching goal of the proposed studies is to determine how CALHM1 and CALHM3 contribute to a hetero-oligomeric ATP release channel in Type II taste cells.            CALHM1, the pore forming subunit of an ion channel regulated by both voltage and extracellular Ca2+, is expressed in Type II taste cells and the brain. Calhm1 knockout mice cannot perceive sweet, bitter and umami tastants and exhibit defects in tastant-evoked ATP release from Type II taste cells. This suggests that CALHM1 plays an important physiological role in taste perception. However, there are differences in the kinetic properties of native CALHM1-dependent currents in Type II taste cells compared to CALHM1 currents in heterologous systems. It is important to identify the reasons for these inconsistencies to further our understanding of ATP release from Type II taste cells and taste perception.            There are five additional Calhm family members of unknown function in humans. CALHM2 and CALHM3 are also expressed in Type II taste cells, but on their own, cannot form functional ion channels. Strikingly, co- expression of CALHM3 with CALHM1 in heterologous systems gave rise to a novel conductance with fast activation kinetics similar to those of the CALHM1-dependent currents observed in Type II taste cells. This led to the hypothesis that CALHM1 and CALHM3 may form a hetero-oligomeric ATP release channel in vivo.           To determine the molecular basis for voltage-dependent gating of CALHM channels and define the role of CALHM3 in taste perception, a combination of electrophysiological and cell biological approaches will be utilized. CALHM proteins do not exhibit conserved architecture with canonical voltage-gated ion channels. To gain insight into the molecular determinants for the voltage-dependent gating of CALHM1, electrophysiology studies of chimeric channels and point mutants will be performed. This will lead to the identification of the activation gate and channel pore as well as specific residues required for voltage-dependent gating and ion selectivity properties. Knowledge gained from defining the molecular basis for CALHM1 gating will be critical for interpretation of similar electrophysiological studies that will be conducted o determine how CALHM3 contributes to the novel gating properties of the putative CALHM1 / CALHM3 hetero-oligomeric channel. To define the role of CALHM3 in taste perception as well as ATP release and CALHM1-dependent currents in Type II taste cells, behavioral, cell biological and electrophysiological analyses of Calhm3 knockout mice will be performed. This study will lead to an understanding of the molecular mechanism for CALHM channel gating and the role of CALHM3 in the perception of sweet, bitter and umami taste compounds."

"9171369","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  Despite the advent of effective statin therapies, atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States and worldwide. In addition to the well-known role of cholesterol as a major risk factor contributing to cardiovascular disease, evidence from many laboratories points to two other critical contributory factors, namely, dysregulated inflammation and metabolism. The latter two factors are inter- dependent, and metabolically active cells, in response to excess nutrient input, can generate a low-grade, chronic inflammation, referred to as metaflammation. This concept has become increasingly important as an epidemic of obesity in the Western world is driving the incidence of insulin resistance, diabetes, and athero- sclerosis, and consequent morbidity and mortality. The long-term goal of our Program Project is to gain a deep and mechanistic understanding of the genetic events and cellular and physiological processes underlying the connections between inflammation, metabolism, and atherogenesis. A central hypothesis is that macrophages are critically important early responders to metabolic stress, and that they in turn, by paracrine mechanisms, influence the responses of other cells crucial in metaflammation, particularly adipocytes and endothelial cells.  The specific objectives of this Program are (i) to understand the molecular basis of interleukin-1 receptor/Toll- like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages and EC, and delineate their roles in the initiation and pathogenesis of obesity-associated inflammatory disease (Project 1, Dr. Xiaoxia Li), (ii) to utilize mouse genetic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to identify atherosclerosis modifier genes and genetic modifiers of macrophage foam cell lipid droplet metabolism (Project 2, Dr. Jonathan Smith), and (iii) to determine the noncanonical function of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) as a critical effector of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in adipocytes and macrophages, and its contribution to diet-induced obesity and atherosclerosis (Project 3, Dr. Paul Fox). The Project Leaders are a highly integrated and synergistic group employing distinct but complementary approaches, i.e., cell signaling (Li), mouse genetics/genomics/proteomics (Smith), and biochemistry (Fox). Three scientific Cores - Primary Cell and Mouse Metabolism, Atherosclerosis and Lipoprotein Analysis, and Macromolecular Interaction - and an Administration Core provide multi-project support, expertise, and service in a cost-effective manner, significantly strengthening each of the Projects. We anticipate our collaborative effort will lead to the discovery of novel genes, signaling pathways, and macro-molecular interactions that promote or restrict atherogenesis, and that can be leveraged to reduce disease initiation and progression, and support health and longevity."
"9197668","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our proposal is based upon new and important findings involving changes in mitochondrial structure and function in cerebral arteries after ischemia which are of scientific interest because they overturn accepted thinking concerning mitochondrial status and function after ischemia. These findings are of translational interest because they open up novel therapeutic avenues which can be used in people following strokes. Our overall hypothesis, derived from our discoveries, is that naturally occurring and drug inducible changes in mitochondria, primarily in endothelium following ischemia, lead to improved cerebral vascular function, preserved blood-brain barrier, and reduced neurological injury. We find that mitochondria are more resiliant after ischemic insult than previously believed and thus represent a novel therapy in stroke patients. The stroke model we use induces patterns of cerebral vascular and brain injury similar to those seen in patients in which the vascular occlusion is not removed until 3 or more hours following the onset of stroke. Several studies have shown that tPA administration in a 3- to 4.5-hour window after stroke onset shows a modest therapeutic benefit with little benefit beyond 4.5 hours. These patients in the 3-4.5 hour post-onset period represent a large and extremely vulnerable population. We expect that mitochondrial targeting in addition to clot removal will lessen morbidity and mortality in these patients. We will test our hypothesis in cultured cerebral vascular endothelial cells, isolated cerebral arteries, and the in vivo cerebral circulation. Aim 1. Determination of naturally occurring morphological and functional changes in mitochondria in the cerebral vasculature following ischemic stress. We will test the hypothesis that structural changes in mitochondria, including size, numbers, and/or protein content, especially in endothelium, are correlated with functional changes involving maintained dilator and protective responses following ischemia. Aim 2. Determination of inducible changes in mitochondrial dynamics in the cerebral vasculature following ischemic stress. We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologically-induced post-conditioning will further improve upon natural mitochondrial-dependent processes in the cerebral circulation following ischemia."

"9265294","The linkage of Zika viral (ZIKV) infection to microcephaly and other severe neurological impairments pose a major threat to the global public health. Currently very little is known about how ZIKV causes neural damage, and what the risk is for ZIKV-infected pregnant women in terms of their babies with microcephaly or other defects. To begin filling these gaps, we need an effective and clinically relevant in vitro ZIKV infection model. The specific objective of this pilot project is to establish such in vitro model using native human fetal brain-derived neural stem cells (NSCs). We will use this system to examine both African and Asian lineages of ZIKV, and gain insight into mechanisms underlying ZIKV-mediated neural impairments. In general terms, our central hypothesis is that ZIKV infects and adversely affects human fetal brain NSCs and their differentiated neural cells. This project will be conducted through a collaboration of multiple investigators by combining our expertise in NSCs and ZIKV, and will pursue two specific aims: 1) To characterize ZIKV infection in human fetal brain NSCs and their differentiated progenies; and 2) To characterize ZIKV-mediated changes in human fetal brain NSCs. Aim 1 will determine whether various strains of ZIKV differ in their ability to infect human NSCs and their differentiated neural cells. Particularly, this study will include a strain of Asian lineage isolated from the mosquitoes in the current outbreak in Mexico, compared to the old African strain. Aim 2 will characterize the effects of ZIKV infection on NSC proliferation, survival and differentiation. This proof-of- concept study is expected to confirm the infectiveness of ZIKV in native human fetal brain-derived NSCs and their differentiated progenies. The establishment of an effective human fetal brain NSC-based in vitro system will facilitate our efforts to dissect pathological mechanisms underlying ZIKV neurotrophism at cellular and molecular levels, to predict the risk of ZIKV neuropathogenesis, and to test potential interventions to halt and/or reverse ZIKV-associated neural damages."
"9177360","For infants facing early adversity, intervening early and targeting specific nurturing parent behaviors has proven to be effective in promoting healthy infant social-emotional trajectories. Sadly, maternal depression skyrockets during early infancy, especially for low-income women and interferes with maternal engagement in interventions shown to be effective generally in improving infant social-emotional outcomes. Maternal depression in the first year postpartum constitutes an enormous and costly public health concern with extensive and well-documented detrimental effects on infant parenting and infant life course trajectories. Maternal depression treatments operate in silos, separate from infant parent interventions that target specific parent behaviors shown to promote infant competencies. There is an absence of integrated interventions with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing both maternal depression and promoting infant parenting behavior that builds infant social-emotional competencies. To address the life course needs of depressed mothers and their infants, we need brief, accessible, and integrated interventions that target both maternal depression and specific nurturing parent behaviors shown to improve infant social-emotional trajectories. In our prior programmatic research, we have developed two separate web- based, remote coaching interventions for: (a) parent nurturing behaviors that improve infant outcomes (Baby- Net R34; R01), and (b) maternal depression (Mom-Net R34; R01). Compared to controls, the Baby- Net program demonstrated medium to large effects on observed nurturing parent behavior and on infant social- emotional competencies in the context of play and in the context of book activities. Mom-Net demonstrated low attrition and high levels of feasibility, program use, and satisfaction. Compared to controls, Mom-Net participants demonstrated significant reductions in depression and improved preschool parenting behavior. A substantial advantage of the web-based, remote coaching approach is that it overcomes multiple logistical barriers that often prevent low-income mothers from participating in community/home-visiting treatment programs. While Mom-Net exists for depressed mothers of preschoolers, it is not designed for infant parenting. Moreover, in Baby-Net studies, we found that maternal depression significantly impeded program progress and positive intervention effects. Thus, our prior research on web-based maternal depression and specific nurturing parenting behavior in infancy, provides a strong empirical basis to integrate salient Mom-Net depression content into the Baby-Net program to target depression and specific infant parenting behaviors that promote infant social-emotional competencies and trajectories. We will rigorously test the merged Your Strength-Your Baby (YSYB) intervention effects with 180 low-income mothers with depression and their infants via a 2-arm, intent-to-treat, randomized controlled trial."
"9171373","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vaccination with MHC-II restricted ApoB100 peptides to prevent atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of large and medium-sized arteries triggered by elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Recent evidence shows that both innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to the disease. Using an in vitro screening assay, we found 34 peptides from mouse apolipoprotein (Apo)B100 that bind major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II (I-Ab in Apoe-/- mice) with high affinity and tested 5 of them in vivo. We discovered that vaccination with I-Ab-binding ApoB100 peptides is strongly atheroprotective in the Apoe-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis. The reductions of atherosclerotic lesion size are associated with increased IL-10 expression in the aortas of vaccinated mice. Since we find elevated IL-10 in aortas of vaccinated mice, we hypothesize that immunization with ApoB100 peptides induces IL-10-producing Tregs and/or IL-10-producing macrophages. Specific aim 1 is to test which cell type is responsible for IL-10 production in aortas of vaccinated mice. We have crossed Apoe-/- mice to IL-10 reporter mice to identify the IL-10-producing cells. Cell type-specific IL-10 knockout mice (Il10fl/fl x LysM-Cre or x FoxP3- Cre) will identify the relevance of this proposed mechanism. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that Tregs afford protection from atherosclerosis. Specific aim 2 is to test the role o regulatory T cells (Tregs) in atheroprotection by ApoB100 peptides. We propose to define the antigen-specific CD4 T cells by surface phenotype and cytokine secretion, test their homing to atherosclerotic mouse aortas and study their interaction with dendritic cells (DCs) in atherosclerotic plaque by live cell multiphoton imaging. Based on preliminary data identifying 30 human ApoB100 peptides that bind many alleles of human MHC-II, we propose that ApoB100-based atheroprotective vaccination strategies are translatable to humans. Specific aim 3 is to translate atheroprotective vaccination to humans. We discovered one peptide that is human-to-mouse ApoB100 sequence-identical and binds to many human MHC-II alleles including DRB1*0101. We will test the effect of this sequence-identical ApoB100 peptide on atherosclerosis in existing mice transgenic for DRB1*0101, optimize vaccination regimens (adjuvant, frequency, dose) and evaluate the potential of tetramers and peptide- specific antibodies as biomarkers reporting successful vaccination. When the proposed work is completed, we will know (1) the role of IL-10 in vaccination-induced atheroprotection (2) the role of Tregs in atheroprotection and the mechanism of their homing and maintenance in the aorta and (3) whether this approach is indeed practical and translatable to humans. We already have an in vitro screening assay and propose to develop biomarkers to test for successful vaccination. Ultimately, a safe and effective atherosclerosis vaccine could have a very large national and world-wide public health impact."
"9185316","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To assess the role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of type 2 diabetes development, we will examine a birth cohort of 1022 subjects born in 1986-1987 at the Faroe Islands, where an unusually wide range of exposures to environmental chemicals has been documented. Cohort members will now be invited at age 27 years for clinical examination, including oral glucose tolerance test, to assess glucose metabolism, hepatic insulin sensitivity, metabolic flexibility, and clinical signs of metabolic syndrome development. Data on chemical exposures, body weight and other covariates were obtained at birth and at previous clinical examinations at ages 7, 14, and 22 years. Existing exposure data include methylmercury, PCB, and DDE, and they will now be complemented by analyses of perfluorinated compounds in cord blood and postnatal samples. All of these substances are suspected of being diabetogenic, possibly through developmental programming of glucose metabolism. To establish an epigenetic signature for these exposures we will conduct a genome-wide epigenetic mapping using DNA extracted from whole blood from cohort members. We will examine CpG islands and shores, CpG outside islands, non-CpG methylated sites identified in human cancer stem cells, miRNA promoter regions and disease-associated regions identified through GWAS. The total and site-specific DNA methylations will be linked to exposures to environmental chemicals at birth and postnatally and to clinical indicators of glucose metabolism and metabolic flexibility. We will determine if exposures to the pollutants are associated with subclinical changes related to type 2 diabetes, whether these changes are mediated by DNA methylation, and whether they are affected by changes in body weight. These results will therefore contribute to our understanding of developmental programming effects of environmental chemicals, as indicated by DNA methylation, and their role in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis."
"9369866","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, more than 300,000 patients are admitted per year and over 2 billon dollars spent on their care. Despite the enormity of the disease, there is currently no targeted therapy, primarily due to incomplete understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. The current paradigm of both acute and chronic pancreatitis revolves around intra-acinar activation of trypsin, which is believed to be central to both acinar cell injury and inflammation. However, evidence in support of the 'trypsin central' hypothesis can best be described as correlational and circumstantial. Thus far, no direct evidence exists to show that the premature activation of trypsinogen, observed early during pancreatitis, is casually responsible for the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. The exciting findings from our preliminary studies (using our newly developed cationic trypsinogen and cathepsin B knockout mice) aimed at elucidating the role of trypsin in pathogenesis of pancreatitis suggest that trypsin partially contributes to pancreatic injury in acute pancreatitis but is not required for development of chronic pancreatitis. This grant proposal is geared towards elucidating the actual contributions of intra-acinar activated trypsin and inflammatory pathways in acute and chronic pancreatitis and offers a unique opportunity to reconcile research of the last decades. In aim 1, we will evaluate the role of trypsin in pancreatic injury during acute pancreatitis using newly developed cationic trypsinogen knockout mice in several in vivo and in vitro models of the disease. In aim 2, we will study the role of inflammation in pancreatic and systemic injury during acute pancreatitis. This will involve use of cationic trypsinogen knockout mice in combination with mice harboring variants of NFkB signaling and creating mice with deletion of cationic trypsinogen and disrupted NFkB signaling. In aim 3, we will determine the role of trypsin in pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis using two different models. In aim 4, the role of repeated inflammatory insult in the absence of trypsin activation will be investigated in chronic pancreatitis using cationic trypsinogen deleted and NFkB signaling defective mice. Successful completion of the proposed studies will uncover novel mechanisms for the pathogenesis of acute and chronic pancreatitis for which currently we do not have targeted therapeutics. A better understanding of the complex mechanisms will be useful for developing future novel treatments."
"9239859","This project focuses on the interplay of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-encoded immunomodulators and host defense pathways that control the initial stages of viral infection within the natural host. These cell-autonomous pathways dictate parameters of acute infection, such as tissue tropism and dissemination. They also control establishment of a reservior for life-long persistence and latency and constantly defend against host immune clearance mechanisms. Importantly, we have shown that herpesviruses such as human (H) or murine (M) CMV, as well as herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 and HSV2, all employ evolutionarily related cell death suppressors that block programmed cell death. In MCMV, suppressors prolong infection and enhance spread, providing a tractable model to elaborate the contribution of specific cellular compartments to the ancient virus- host arms race that plays out during natural infection. The host pathways we study are conserved in humans as well as mice, providing key insights that cannot be obtained using HCMV or primate CMV models. Macrophages are important partners for all CMVs, starting from the initial encounter with virus inoculum, proceeding with the orchestration of viral dissemination, resulting in the deposition in sites of persistence and latency, and critical for the reappearence of virus sporadically or as a result of immunosuppression. All of the insights into murine CMV pathogenesis and latency from the studies we propose will point relevant directions for studies in human CMV. Our unique approach involves the use of viruses that lack specific cell death suppressors combined with mice that are deficient in the cognate host defense pathways that these suppressors target. We propose to move to a new phase of study and dissect the contribution of apoptosis, necroptosis and other programmed cell death pathways within specific tissue compartments. These studies are therefore relevant to an expanding range of human pathogens, most immediately HSV and other human herpesviruses. The specific host defense value of necroptosis has recently emerged along with the fascinating observation that this and other cell death pathways are interlaced and interdependent. Necroptosis is capable of completely preventing infection of a naïve host because all exposed cells die within hours of exposure. In the next period, we will specifically investigate the contribution of serine protease death pathways that were first brought to light in our studies of HCMV in macrophages. Importantly, the project will determine the contribution of cell death in monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and epithelial cells during natural infection in mice. As a result, the contribution of specific programmed cell death pathways to all relevant stages of viral pathogenesis will emerge."
"9219081","The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is one of the most important causes of severe diarrheal disease, and the disease manifests itself with varied epidemiology around the world. In the U.S. outbreaks are linked to tainted recreational and drinking water and have occurred at massive scale. Patients suffering from immunosuppression due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, or cancer are in gravest danger. The global public health impact is even larger: after Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium is the most important diarrheal pathogen in small children. In infants, in particular in the context of malnutrition, cryptosporidiosis has a highly significant imprint on overall early childhood mortality and morbidity. Cryptosporidiosis is also linked to stunting, thus leaving a lasting shadow on the future of children. There are no vaccines and only a single drug of marginal efficacy. This parasite has a single host life cycle, both asexual and sexual processes occur sequentially in the intestinal epithelium of the same host. Completion of this developmental program is required for continued infection, severe disease, and spread of the pathogen. Despite the obvious importance of the lifecycle for drug and vaccine development, our current understanding is rudimentary. This is a biological phenomenon of fascinating complexity ? there is much to discover here ? and we expect insights of fundamental as well as translational significance. We have recently pioneered a genetic system for Cryptosporidum that we will use in this project to dissect the lifecycle at the molecular and cellular level. Under this proposal we will develop rigorous molecular markers and assays for development through asexual and sexual stages, reveal stage specific gene expression, and discover the mechanisms that execute function and progression through the lifecycle. Lack of efficient systems to culture Cryptosporidium has long hampered progress. We will define where specifically in vitro development derails, and these insights will guide future work to facilitate a continuous culture model."
"9258172","How does the hippocampus transform experienced information (encode) and subsequently recall those memories (retrieve)? Our goal in this application is to reveal the mechanisms of encoding and retrieval in the hippocampal-entorhinal system (HES). During encoding and retrieval of spatial memory, the hippocampus communicates with the entorhinal cortex (EC) via coordination of theta (6-10Hz) and gamma (slow range ?25- 50Hz, fast range ?60-100Hz) oscillations. (Lisman and Jensen, 2013). For decades, theta and gamma oscillations have been proposed to have a role in memory processing, however, no studies have shown a direct causal role for theta and gamma oscillations in these processes. This research plan proposes to take advantage of multisite electrophysiology and closed-loop optogenetic stimulation to address two key hypotheses related to the role of theta and gamma oscillations in encoding and retrieval of spatial information. The first aim of the current proposal is to investigate the temporal dynamics of theta and slow/fast gamma coordination during encoding and retrieval of spatial memory. It is hypothesized that a dynamic alternation in theta-modulated slow and fast gamma coordination between CA3-CA1 and medial EC (MEC)-CA1 contributes to retrieval and encoding. However, this dynamic coordination of network activity during encoding and retrieval has never been experimentally observed. To test the above hypothesis, we will combine multisite electrophysiological recordings in CA3, CA1, and MEC in freely behaving mice performing a navigational task successfully applied in our lab (H-shaped maze) to distinguish encoding and retrieval (Siegle and Wilson, 2014). Theta and slow/fast gamma coherence will be analyzed in the CA3-CA1 and MEC-CA1 circuits during encoding and retrieval. In specific aim 2, we will determine the causal role of theta and gamma activity in hippocampal- entorhinal circuits during encoding and retrieval of spatial memory. First, it is hypothesized that entorhinal inputs at the trough of theta support encoding, whereas at the peak of theta intra-hippocampal (e.g., CA3-CA1) interactions support retrieval (Hasselmo et al., 2002). To test this hypothesis, we will use phase-specific closed- loop optogenetic manipulation to disrupt CA3-CA1 or MEC-CA1 circuits at the trough or peak of theta during encoding and retrieval of spatial memory. The second hypothesis suggests that coordinated slow gamma between CA3-CA1 circuits supports retrieval, whereas fast gamma coordination between MEC-CA1 circuits regulates encoding. To test this hypothesis, we will use activity-guide closed-loop optogenetic stimulation to disrupt specifically the coordination of slow or fast gamma activity in CA3-CA1 or MEC-CA1 circuits during encoding and retrieval. Spatial memory will be evaluated after closed-loop intervention. Success in these aims should provide the first causal link between theta- and slow/fast gamma-dependent modulation of entorhinal-hippocampal circuits and encoding/retrieval of spatial information."

"9308120","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Household food insecurity has emerged as a very powerful predictor of poor health among people living with HIV (PLHIV), predicting increased risk of HIV transmission as well as poor HIV outcomes. Household water insecurity (WI) may be equally or more powerfully predictive of HIV-related outcomes, but strikingly, its role in HIV outcomes has been almost entirely overlooked. Indeed, because there is currently no validated scale for assessing household access to water in suf?cient quantity and quality, it has not been possible to measure the consequences of WI. Therefore, the scienti?c objective of this application is to elucidate the role of house- hold WI in poor health outcomes among HIV-infected women and their infants in Nyanza, Western Kenya. This research will further the long-term goal of understanding the behavioral and psychological coping mechanisms that HIV-infected mothers use to preserve their health and that of their infants. The central hypothesis is that WI is detrimental to this population in economic, nutritional, disease, and psychosocial domains, and in ways distinct from food insecurity. This hypothesis was guided by preliminary data from the investigators' ongoing K01-funded cohort in Nyanza, and will be tested via 3 speci?c aims. First, a household WI scale will be developed based on prior research and formative research in Kenya (Aim 1). It will then be piloted and validated (Aim 2). The resultant scale will then be used to assess differences in WI by HIV status and sequelae of WI among 360 women and their infants in the PI's ongoing cohort (Aim 3). It is hypothesized that the prevalence of WI will be greater among HIV-infected women, and that it will be associated with worse outcomes, including greater viral load, diarrhea, stress, depression, and sub-optimal infant feeding practices. This research is highly signi?cant because a) water scarcity is a widespread and growing problem, often occurring in places with high HIV prevalence; b) women bear the major burden of water acquisition and use; and c) there are a number of highly plausible and serious health consequences of WI for HIV-infected women (e.g. diarrhea) and their infants (e.g. less exclusive breastfeeding) given the compromised immunity of PLHIV, their greater water needs, and lesser abilities to access water. With a better understanding of how household WI is deleterious, it will be possible to design more effective interventions to improve the health of HIV-infected mothers and their HIV-ex- posed infants, as well as among people not directly impacted by HIV. This research is innovative for its use of cutting-edge qualitative and quantitative methods to develop the ?rst validated household WI scale and because it will generate novel data to test hypotheses about the pathways by which WI may impact the health of HIV-infected mothers and their infants. The expected outcomes include the ?rst validated household-level WI scale, which will be ready for adaptation among other populations, and an increase in our understanding of the barriers to optimal health faced by HIV-infected mothers, thereby highlighting novel ways to eventually intervene to reduce the risk of poor health outcomes among PLHIV and reduce vertical transmission of HIV."
"9321549","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key function of the intestinal epithelium is to discriminate commensal from pathogenic microbes and thus avoid infectious disease and chronic inflammation; however, little is known about how intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) sense bacteria at the apical surface and transduce the signals to drive appropriate transcriptional responses. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate relationships between IEC and microbe regulatory networks that determine the outcome of host-microbe interactions in vivo. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate pathways mediated by MITF-TFE (MiT) family transcription factors (TFs) that determine the host IEC response to infection. Because MiT family TFs are highly conserved, we chose to use Caenorhabditis elegans, a genetically tractable model organism, as a tool to address these questions. C. elegans exhibits pathogen-specific responses that are independent of TLR, NLR, and NF-kB, and thus represents a useful tool to study novel host defense pathways that are evolutionarily conserved, in an unbiased manner in vivo. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that unknown signaling pathways activated during pathogenic infection control MiT-mediated host defense in C. elegans and human IECs. The rationale for the proposed research is that, once it is understood how MiT TFs function in the host response and how they are regulated in vivo, their activity could likely be manipulated pharmacologically, resulting in new and innovative approaches for the prevention and treatment of a variety of infectious or inflammatory diseases. To test the central hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Elucidate upstream regulators of HLH-30/MiT, using mosaic genetic analysis, biochemical characterization of post-translational modifications, and genetic analysis of candidate upstream pathways; 2) Elucidate downstream target pathways of HLH-30/MiT, using global gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, and 3) Elucidate the role of MiT TFs in human IEC host defense, using human IEC lines in biochemical, molecular, and cell biological approaches cou- pled with high-throughput gene expression profiling. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the elucidation of novel, non-TLR/NLR/NF-?B, HLH-30/MiT-mediated pathways regulating the host response to bacteria in C. elegans and human IECs. These contributions are significant because they are the first step in a continuum of research that will eventually allow pharmacologic manipulation of host defense via MiT signaling, either positively or negatively, to treat infection or inflammatory disease. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because it shows for the first time that MiT TFs are differentially expressed in human IECs during microbial stimulation and intestinal inflammation.Furthermore, the proposed research is innovative because it represents a departure from more directed in vitro approaches and takes advantage of the tractability of C. elegans, and thus is an unbiased and efficient in vivo approach."
"9171379","Project 2 (P2). Genetic modifiers of atherosclerosis and foam cell lipid droplet metabolism Jonathan Smith, Ph.D., Project Leader Project Summary/Abstract Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States. Although the incidence of cardiovascular disease deaths has declined, it still accounts for ~1 out of every 3 deaths. Coronary artery disease (CAD) due to atherosclerosis was responsible for most of these deaths. Despite increased knowledge about CAD risk factors and the availably of drugs to treat them, the CAD problem has not been solved. Large human genome wide association studies have identified many common genetic variants associated with CAD, but only a small fraction of the heritable risk has been discovered. Here we propose to perform mouse genetic and genomic studies to identify atherosclerosis modifier genes and genetic modifiers of foam cell lipid droplet metabolism, yielding insights into the mechanisms that regulate these pathways. These findings may lead to novel drug targets and therapies to prevent or treat CAD. The first aim of the proposed studies involves identifying the responsible genes and genetic variation that give rise to the mouse atherosclerosis susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2 and 17, which we have recently independently replicated. Validation will be performed by allele replacement, the gold standard method to demonstrate a direct causal effect of genetic variation on a phenotype. The second aim of the proposed studies involves the study of an intermediate phenotype that we discovered in atherosclerosis sensitive vs. resistant mice. We found that cholesterol ester stored in lipid droplets of macrophage foam cells is metabolized by autophagy with hydrolysis mediated by lysosomal acid lipase, such that the atherosclerosis sensitive strain has lower rates of flux through this pathway, implying that this pathway is atheroprotective. Thus, we propose to use genetic, genomic, and proteomic studies to identify the genetic variant responsible for this intermediate phenotype, and validate the causal genetic variant via allele replacement. Finally, we will probe whether the antiatherogenic effect of mTOR inhibitors in mice is mediated via an induction of foam cell autophagy."
"9192243","Abstract Aberrant proliferation of epithelial stem cells in the adult prostate can contribute to hyperplastic growth (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH) and subsequent quality of life challenges. Despite intensive study, little is known about the prostate epithelial stem cell hierarchy and resulting lineage relationships. Bona fide epithelial stem cells are defined by their self-renewal, multipotency, and regenerative capabilities. Additionally, it is thought that prostatic stem cells can survive without androgen signaling, in contrast to differentiated cells. The mentor's lab has previously shown that the transcription factor Sox2, well known for its roles in maintenance of embryonic stemness, is expressed in adult murine and human prostate epithelium. Further, unpublished data from the mentor's lab indicate that Sox2+ cells are formed just prior to embryonic development of the prostate and can persist after androgen deprivation. Using a genetic lineage tracing strategy, we have observed that Sox2-expressing cells of the prostate can persist long- term (over 3 months), suggesting that they may be progenitor cells. Defining the contribution of Sox2+ cells to tissue homeostasis and regeneration is essential to understanding the prostate stem cell lineage hierarchy, a current gap in knowledge in the field. These data are critical to development of novel strategies that target progenitor cell populations in BPH, an unmet therapeutic need. However, it remains unclear whether Sox2+ cells are bona fide stem cells and/or are required for tissue development and homeostasis. The scientific objective of this application is therefore to bridge this knowledge gap by studying the contributions of Sox2+ cells to the homeostasis of prostate epithelium in health and disease. The proposal is innovative because it will be the first to determine whether Sox2 expression maintains adult prostate stem cells, which has not been previously investigated. The proposed research is significant because it will link specific regulatory mechanisms of stem cell maintenance to benign prostatic hyperplasia, allowing therapeutic exploitation of fundamental cellular processes. In addition to benefitting diseases associated with prostatic hyperplasia, the concepts and tools developed may be applicable to the study of epithelial stem cells for diseases of other organs that are driven by hormonal dysfunction."
"9191250","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In 2012, there were an estimated 43,920 new cases of pancreatic cancer in the United States.  The incidence nearly equals the prevalence in this deadly disease.  A majority of patients present with advanced, incurable disease.   Even with the most aggressive combination chemotherapy, median survival for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer remains less than 1 year.  Alternative approaches to therapy are desperately needed.  A new class of antibody drugs is being developed that turn off the brakes (signals sent out by the cancer cells to evade recognition by the immune system) that are now known to inhibit cancer fighting immune cells.  Unlike some cancers, pancreatic cancer does not naturally induce these cancer fighting immune cells.  Therefore, vaccines are necessary to induce and expand tumor specific immune cells and likely are needed to be given together with agents designed to turn off the brakes on these immune cells to avoid inactivation when these tumor killing immune cells infiltrate the tumor. There is preclinical and preliminary clinical data to support the concept that immunotherapy can work in pancreatic cancer.  To build on this progress and make the therapy more effective, this proposal will test GVAX + IPI in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have been stabilized with upfront FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy versus continuing standard therapy.  Integrating immunotherapy after upfront chemotherapy has several advantages. Chemotherapy can predispose cancer cells to cell death mediated by immune cells.  Furthermore, chemotherapy is still the best therapy to stabilize patients with pancreatic cancer.  Immunotherapy can take weeks to months to be effective and is therefore unlikely to work in patients who cannot initially be stabilized. GVAX + IPI showed promise in heavily pre-treated patients and giving it immediately after front line chemotherapy is likely to improve activity.  This proposal will provide the evidence needed to conduct the final approval trial that will bring immunotherapy to patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.  If the proposal is successful, future studies will focus on expanding treatment to other pancreatic cancer populations such as those with localized and resected disease.         The primary clinical objective of the protocol is to compare the overall survival (OS) of the two treatment groups.  The secondary clinical objectives are to assess the safety of the treatment with particular attention to immune related adverse events, to measure CA19-9 tumor marker kinetics, to measure progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) and immune-related RECIST.        Correlative immune analyses will be conducted to identify predictors of response.  Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and serum will be collected to identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers and predictors of response and autoimmune toxicity.  Induction of antigen specific T cell responses to mesothelin and changes in the mesothelin-specific T cell epitope repertoire will be correlated with OS.  Lymphocyte telomere length as a predictor of response will be tested.  Induction of galectin-3 antibody responses will be correlated with response. Proteomic approaches will be used on pre and post treatment sera to identify targets and biomarkers of response or toxicity.        Archived tissue and pre and post treatment biopsies will be obtained to test for predictors of response and future targets for combinatorial therapy.  Next generation genome sequencing will be used to identify immune responsive disease subtypes and immunohistochemistry will be used to characterize the nature of tumors and immune infiltrates in responsive subsets.   Furthermore, upregulation of immune inhibitory molecules in the pre or post treatment samples may identify additional therapeutic targets."
"9194937","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia meeting entitled Cellular Stress Responses and Infectious Agents, organized by Drs. Margo A. Brinton, Sandra K. Weller and Beth Levine. The meeting will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico from December 4-8, 2016. This conference will bring together researchers studying various cellular stress responses and researchers interested in how various infectious agents activate and manipulate host cellular stress responses. Examples of cellular stress responses activated by infectious agents are: the stress granule response, the unfolded protein response, the DNA damage response, responses to oxidative stress and metabolic stress, autophagy, and other protein quality control responses. Many of these cellular homeostatic mechanisms function as part of innate and intrinsic defense mechanisms to counteract infections. Various infectious agents have evolved to subvert and manipulate many of these anti- pathogen mechanisms by utilizing, evading or inactivating components of these cellular pathways. The study of interactions between infectious agents and these pathways provides new insights about cellular stress responses and identifies new targets for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of infectious diseases. The general topic of this meeting is relevant to the NIAID mission with respect to its mission of understanding and treating infectious diseases. Specifically, studies of cell stress responses and how these responses are utilized and/or counteracted by an infectious agent will lead to a better understanding of cell-pathogen interactions."
"9171377","Project 1 (P1). Signaling mechanisms of toll-like and interleukin-1 receptors in inflammation Xiaoxia Li, Ph.D., Project Leader Project Summary/Abstract Obesity is a crucial public health problem that is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and cardiovascular disease, affecting 25% of the population and its incidence is growing. IL-1R/TLRs have been directly implicated in obesity-associated inflammatory diseases. TLR2 or TLR4 deficiency reduced diet-induced insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, while human TLR4 null mutations are associated with reduced risk of atherosclerosis. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate IL-1R/TLR-mediated signaling mechanisms in the inflammatory response associated with metabolic diseases. Our long-term goals are to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop more effective anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs. Genetic and biochemical studies by us and others revealed that IL- 1R/TLRs interact with the adaptor MyD88 to initiate TAK1 (TGF?-activated kinase 1)- and MEKK3 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 3)-dependent pathways. Each pathway involves cascades of kinases organized by multiple adapter molecules into parallel and sequential signaling complexes, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF?B. IL- 1R/TLRs also mediate mRNA stabilization and promote protein translation of cytokines and chemokines through their impact on RNA binding proteins and translation mediators (mTOR and MnK1). We have previously shown that the kinase activity of IRAK4 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) is required for TAK1-dependent NF?B activation and posttranscriptional induction of cytokines and chemokines, but not for MEKK3-dependent NF?B activation. We have recently reported that while IRAK1 and IRAK2 interact with MyD88-IRAK4 to mediate TAK1-dependent NF?B activation and posttranscriptional control respectively; IRAKM (without functional kinase domain) mediates a second wave of IL-1R-TLR-induced NF?B activation through the MEKK3-dependent pathway, but also attenuates protein translation of cytokines and chemokines. In this proposal, we propose two Aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of IL-1R/TLRs signaling: (1) Delineate the precise molecular mechanism for IRAK1-mediated TAK1-dependent NF?B activation; (2) Investigate the mechanisms of IRAK2-mediated posttranscriptional control of cytokines and chemokines; (3) Elucidate the mechanisms by which IRAKM mediates MEKK3-dependent NF?B activation and its inhibitory effect on translational control of cytokines and chemokines. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism of IL-1R/TLRs signaling for the development of obesity-associated diseases: (1) Study how IL- 1R/TLRs signaling mediate the cross-talk between adipocytes and macrophages contributing to diet-induced systemic inflammation and exacerbation on atherosclerosis; (2) Determine the impact of IL-1R/TLRs signaling in endothelial cells on the recruitment of monocytes and polarization of inflammatory macrophages."
"9174911","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that up to 20% of American adults suffer from sleep apnea with an increased risk of developing hypertension and vascular dysfunction. We have observed that simulating sleep apnea in rats by exposing them to intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep also increases blood pressure, augments constrictor sensitivity and impairs endothelial dilation. These vascular changes appear to be due in part to loss of the synthesis of the vasodilator, hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Proposed studies will evaluate the mechanisms of H2S- induced vasodilation and determine how IH exposure impairs H2S signaling to impair vasodilation. H2S is a recently described vasodilator produced in the vasculature by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE). H2S hyperpolarizes and relaxes vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) but much is still unknown about where, when and how it acts. Genetic deletion of CSE in mice elevates blood pressure and impairs endothelium- dependent dilation supporting its role as an important regulator of the vasculature. Our recent studies reveal that H2S causes vasodilation by activating large-conductance calcium-sensitive potassium channels (BKCa) in endothelial cells, eBK. This autocrine effect of H2S has not previously been investigated and is the focus of this proposal. CSE expression in EC is regulated by the transcription factor, NFATc3 and our data suggest IH decreases NFATc3 activation in EC leading to decreased CSE expression and impaired H2S- induced dilation. Our long term goal is to define H2S signaling in the vascular wall, to understand its regulation during intermittent hypoxia and to clarify its role in normal and pathological vascular function. The guiding hypothesis for the proposed studies that H2S activates eBK to mediate dilation and that IH disrupts this pathway by decreasing CSE expression. The first Aim of the project is to evaluate H2S activation of K+ channels in endothelial cells. The second Aim is to define the mechanism IH-induced decreases in CSE-dependent vasodilation expression. The third Aim is to Evaluate H2S regulation of blood flow in renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds determine how IH alters the regulation to contribute to elevated blood pressure. Together the proposed studies will define H2S signaling at molecular, tissue and whole animal levels to increase our understanding of how H2S contributes to cardiovascular control. Defining the causes of dysregulated H2S signaling in IH-exposed rats will also provide a rational basis for the future development of therapies targeting to effectively treat hypertension and peripheral vascular disease in the sleep apnea population."

Preliminary results serve as a solid foundation for this Fast Track submission entitled Development of Recyclable Magnetic Co/C Hybrid ROMP Ligands/Reagents/Scavengers. This proposal aims to develop, optimize and scale-up recyclable magnetic Co/C hybrid ROMP ligands/reagents/scavengers and streamline the process for their commercialization. More specifically, Phase I will focus on two key areas: namely, (1) the development and generation of multi-gram quantities of five recyclable, magnetic, high-load Co/C hybrid ROMP ligands/reagents/scavengers utilizing surface-initiated ROM polymerization, where the Phase I Milestone Goal is the synthesis and multi-gram scale-up of five reagents, namely Co/C-OTPP, Co/C-OOAS, Co/C-OPC, Co/C OMam and Co/C OPy, and (2) utilization of magnetic Co/C hybrid ROMP reagents in synthetic transformations for the facilitated synthesis of small molecules, applications in parallel synthesis and sequestration protocols.

We are well-positioned to meet the challenges of this proposal with expertise in the use of ROMP technologies for the production of soluble and Si-immobilized reagents (KU and Materia Inc.), a Co-C nanoparticle technology collaboration with Professor Oliver Reiser at the University of Regensburg, Dr. Robert Grass at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ), Switzerland, and the use of ROMP reagents for production of chemical libraries within the Center for Chemical Methodologies and Library Development at The University of Kansas (KU-CMLD). These efforts are augmented with the core technologies and expertise within Materia, Inc. for process optimization and scale-up synthesis. Moreover, associations within the KU-CMLD and pharmaceutical companies will allow for beta testing of the reagents within drug discovery and commodity chemical platforms.

"9361542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial development is a complex morphogenic process, disruptions in which result in highly prevalent birth defects in humans. Signaling through platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR?) plays a critical role in craniofacial development; mutant mouse models of the gene display phenotypes such as facial clefting, subepidermal blebbing and facial hemorrhaging. While the other receptor tyrosine kinase in the family, PDGFR?, does not have an established role in craniofacial development, limited evidence from the literature indicates that the two receptors may be able to form functional heterodimers with distinct properties from homodimeric receptor complexes. Our preliminary in vitro studies reveal that PDGFR? and PDGFR? are expressed in primary mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells and are capable of forming functional heterodimers with the capacity to activate downstream signaling pathways. Further preliminary in vivo analyses demonstrate that the two receptors interact in the neural crest cell lineage during craniofacial development, as double homozygous mutant embryos exhibit an overt facial clefting phenotype with subepidermal blebbing that is more severe than that observed in either single mutant embryo. The aim of this application is to explore the role of PDGFR? in craniofacial development, with a long-term goal of identifying novel effector molecules operating downstream of this receptor during midline development and characterizing their role in the etiology of facial clefting and subepidermal blebbing. First, a homologous recombination knock- in approach will be used to generate a PdgfrbmCherry null reporter allele. Reporter expression will be analyzed in craniofacial structures in whole mount using a fluorescent stereomicroscope and in coronal frozen sections by immunofluorescence analysis. Second, the activation of signaling pathways, proliferation, survival and migration will be assessed downstream of PDGFR? homodimer versus PDGFR?/? heterodimer activation by Western blotting, BrdU incorporation assays, cell growth curves and Transwell assays, respectively. Finally, the interaction of PDGFR? and PDGFR? will be characterized during craniofacial development in vivo, by employing conditional alleles for both genes together with a Wnt1-Cre driver to target ablation in the neural crest. The phenotypes of compound mutant mice will be compared to those of single homozygous mutant embryos by morphological, histological and marker expression analyses. The research strategy outlined in this application will take advantage of the vast array of reagents available for the PDGF signaling pathway, as well as generate vital new tools, to explore novel aspects of craniofacial biology. The innovative studies proposed here will explore the expression of PDGFR? in the facial mesenchyme and identify the signaling pathways and cellular processes induced downstream of PDGFR? homodimer and PDGFR?/? heterodimer activation during craniofacial development, ultimately providing new therapeutic directions aimed at the prevention of craniofacial birth defects."
"9084596","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male infertility affects 5-10% of the population. A major factor associated with male infertility is Y chromosome deletions, yet our understanding of the requirement for specific genes on the Y chromosome and of their roles in sperm production/function is still poor. Y chromosome genes may provide essential spermatogenic functions or just potentiate the spermatogenic process. Our long-term goal is to define the function of Y chromosome encoded genes in mice in a context of assisted reproduction technologies (ART) as a way to model human Y- linked infertility cases. We have established that only two Y chromosome genes, testis determinant gene Sry and spermatogonial proliferation factor Eif2s3y are required for production of male gametes capable of participating in assisted fertilization. In Preliminary Data we show that males with a Y complement limited to Sry and Eif2s3y have spermatogenesis arrest and do not produce mature sperm. The precursor haploid germ cells (spermatids) are rare and often abnormal. Nevertheless, with round spermatid injection (ROSI) we succeeded in producing viable, healthy, and fertile progeny. This offers a promise to men with extensive Y gene loss and resulting azoospermia. Here, our specific goal is to define whether ART can be achieved even without this minimum Y gene contribution. We will test the hypothesis that the Y chromosome complement can be eliminated entirely while retaining production of functional male gametes. In Aim 1 we wil test if transgenic activation of Sox9, a downstream effector of Sry, will effectively replace Sry function and whether Sry-to-Sox9 replacement affects spermatogenesis and fertility, testing directly for the as yet unknown function of these genes in mature gonads. We will also establish if Eif2s3x, an X encoded homologue of Eif2s3y, can replace Eif2s3y function in spermatogonial proliferation. We will generate and characterize mice transgenic for Eif2s3x, and assess whether overexpression of Eif2s3x can rescue spermatogonial proliferation arrest in XOSry mice. In Aim 2, we will produce males without any Y genes but with overexpression of Eif2s3x and with transgenic activation of Sox9, as well as males with one Y gene retained and the other replaced. We will investigate how the presence of these genes affects spermatogenesis progression. We will also test if spermatogenesis in these males enables development of germ cells functional in ART, and whether such produced offspring are normal. In Aim 3, we will attempt to rescue spermatogonial arrest in testes of mature males with in vivo Eif2s3y gene transfer using novel 'active transgenesis' approach and ultrasound mediated gene delivery. Our studies will advance the understanding of (1) the roles that key players of sex determination (Sry and Sox9) play in mature gonads; (2) the roles of sex chromosome genes (Eif2s3y and Eif2s3x) in the initiation of spermatogenesis; and (3) the compatibility of extensive Y gene loss with successful ART. Our results should translate to enhance treatment of human infertility associated with Y chromosome deletions."

"9174091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the same sensory information, we generate different responses in different situations, depending on our goal, task rule, etc. This flexibilit is a hallmark of cognition and involves gated routing of information flow in the brain circuitry, the underlying mechanism remains largely mysterious. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to elucidate computational principles and circuit basis of gated computation and flexible sensori-motor mapping in decision-making. I propose that gating is accomplished by four complementary mechanisms: (a) tunable dendritic inhibition by a subclass of GABAergic neurons for input gating, (b) pathway-specific excitation-inhibition balance for processing in discrete stages, (c) top-down signaling from rule representation for network selection, (d) a STOP process for inhibitory control of automatic response. I will rigorously investigate these mechanisms in biologically based circuit models, in collaboration with experimentalists who are carrying out single-neuron physiological experiments in which monkeys perform flexible visuo-motor tasks. In a paradigmatic task of controlled action, the appropriate response to a sensory target is to either shift the gaze toward it (pro-saccade) or away from it (anti-saccade) depending on task context. In colored-target tasks, a perceptual decision about an ambiguous stimulus or a probabilistic inference based on sensory cues must be made, before the subject knows when and how the decision will be used to guide action selection. Our model will be tested by quantitatively reproducing single-neuron activity data as well as behavioral performance, and uncovering the underlying circuit mechanisms that will be testable in new experiments. In Aim 1, I will examine circuit mechanisms for gating, including input-specific dendritic inhibition and the idea of pathway-specific excitation-inhibition balance. Aim 2 will be devoted to rule-based action selection, by developing a detailed circuit model of the pro-/anti-saccade task. In Aim 3, I will examine gated neural dynamics when perceptual decision and action selection are temporally separated. We will build spiking network models for versions of the random dot motion direction discrimination task and weather prediction task. The pro-/anti-saccade and colored-target visuo-motor tasks all depend on flexible routing of information from a sensory decision circuit to an action selection circuit, which confers a strong cohesiveness to this application. This research program will shed insights into complex dynamics of neurons endowed with mixed selectivity that underlie adaptive coding in flexible behavior."
"9174090","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have a 2-3 fold increased risk of myocardial infarction compared to members of the general population. Traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors alone do not accurately predict CVD in RA patients and therefore adequate primary prevention strategies are lacking. Systemic inflammation from active RA is strongly associated with CV risk in RA patients, but mechanisms by which inflammation increases CV morbidity and mortality are poorly understood. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is an anti-atherogenic molecule that regulates systemic inflammation by promoting cholesterol efflux and preventing oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL). We have previously demonstrated that HDL function is impaired and significantly associated with both disease activity and systemic inflammation, in patients with RA. We further showed that active RA leads to oxidative and protein changes in HDL resulting in dysfunctional HDL. Oxidized low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of RA through signaling via the lectin-like ox-LDL receptor 1 (LOX- 1) in the joint synovium. Our preliminary results suggest that modulation of HDL function by increasing HDL's ability to prevent oxidation of LDL is associated with improvement in arthritis activity. We hypothesize that modulation of HDL function represents a novel pathway through which to both decrease arthritis activity and improve CV risk in patients with RA. We will test our hypothesis under two specific aims. In aim 1, we will evaluate whether modulation of HDL function using HDL mimetic peptides can reduce atherosclerosis and joint inflammation in a recently established mouse model of RA. We will also modulate HDL function by paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene deletion and overexpression to evaluate the effects on arthritis activity and atherosclerosis in this model. In aim 2, we will determine whether abnormal HDL function contributes to increased CV risk in a carefully characterized, prospective cohort of over 200 RA patients using in vitro assays of HDL function and targeted HDL proteomics and lipidomics. CV risk will be assessed by the progression of carotid atherosclerosis over three year follow-up and by carotid plaque inflammation using positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). The results of this work may identify important mechanisms through which inflammation increases CV risk in RA patients, and thereby determine new markers for risk assessment and specific targets for intervention."
