"9319911","The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling axis is aberrantly activated in the majority of adult high-grade  gliomas. Activation in glioblastoma (GBM) occurs via one of four mechanisms: 1) Loss of function  mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor; 2) Amplification/gain of function mutations in the receptors for EGF  or PDGF; 3) Activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene that encodes p110?, a catalytic subunit of PI3K, or; 4)  mutations in the gene PIK3R1 that encodes one ofthe PI3K regulatory subunits, p85a. A number of PI3K  inhibitors are in the early stages of clinical trials. One of these, BKM120, is being developed by Novartis and  has been shown to pass through the blood brain barrier, making it an excellent candidate for glioblastoma  therapy. Project 2 will be centered on a trial of BKM in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The broad goal  of Project 2 is to use the data and clinical materials from patients on our BKM120 trial - in concert with  genetically defined mouse models - to address important unresolved questions involving PI3 kinase  inhibitors as glioblastoma therapeutics. In addition to the key data on the impact of genetic modifiers on  response to BKM120 (if any) coming from the human trial, cell culture and animal studies will address  optimization of, and the potential benefits from, combination therapies using BKM120 in concert with  standard of care, as well as a number of rationally targeted therapies. Finally, great promise has been seen  with inhibitors targeting a single catalytic isoform of PI3K. To prepare clinical testing of this new class of  inhibitors, preclinical experiments will be carried out determining the relative importance of the individual  PI3K isoforms in disease driven by Pten loss."
"9149425","Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource:   Project Summary   Chemistry Shared Resource Group   The ability to determine the structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography has been one of the great  scientific achievements over the past 50 to 60 years. It has provided broad insights into many areas of biology,  ranging from the evolution of life, to understanding the chemistry of enzyme catalysis, to the control of cell  growth and death. More recent applications have included producing the binding maps against which targeted  drugs can be designed and evaluated leading to unparalleled growth in effective, safe therapeutics. As such,  X-ray crystallography is an essential tool for the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) to  carry out its mission - to uncover the fundamental sources of cell growth anomalies associated with cancer and  to develop new and effective therapeutics through structure-based drug design.   Accordingly, the primary mission of the Macromolecular Crystallography Shared Resource (MM-SR) is to  provide access to state-of-the-art technologies, hardware and expertise to PCCR members who use X-ray  crystallography to address cancer-related questions and develop anti-cancer therapeutics. Formally  established as a Shared Resource in 1998, this Resource has been committed to the support of  macromolecular crystallography projects of PCCR researchers. The MM-SR has been a crucial resource to  PCCR members studying cancer mechanisms and mutations, visualizing cancer-related drug targets and  performing iterative, structure-based design of anti-cancer therapeutics. To enable the research of X-ray  crystallography expert and non-expert PCCR members, the MM-SR provides and maintains in-house  equipment and computational resources for data collection and processing, robotic systems for high-  throughput micro crystallization experiments and for their imaging and storage, and temperature-controlled  rooms.   The MM-SR's services and support are critical to the PCCR members' research needs because X-ray  crystallography requires that sophisticated and dedicated resources be immediately and locally available to  researchers. Because of the high associated costs and need for technical support, the X-ray data collection  and crystallization hardware resources provided by the MM-SR are beyond the budgets and group size of most  individual labs. This is especially true of the robotic crystallization and robotic visualization systems, which are  key technologies that substantially accelerate the empirical process of identifying crystallization conditions and  also allow, through microliter to nanoliter experiments, the preservation of precious biological material. By  providing centralized hardware and expertise in a shared resource, MM-SR makes these essential  technologies widely available to PCCR members, promoting productivity and scientific interaction."
"9108271","The Cancer Epidemiology Program (CEP) is an interdisciplinary research program organized into three scientific areas, each related to a type of cancer risk factor: (1) Viral Risk Factors, (2) Hormonal, Obesity, and Inflammation- Related Risk Factors, and (3) Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors. Viral Risk Factor research in the CEP focuses extensively on human papillomavirus (HPV) and its role in anogenital and oral cancers. The CEP has long been a major contributor to HPV research. The goal of this research is to contribute new information important to the development of cancer screening practices, HPV vaccine strategies, and other new prevention and treatment methods. This includes studies of the viral and host factors associated with HPV persistence/progression; biomarkers of cervical and anal pre-cancer/cancer; the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in high risk populations; and the impact of microbicides on risk of HPV infection. In addition. Viral Risk Factor research in CEP addresses the effects of HIV/AIDS on cancer, including studies of the immunologic deficits that drive the relationship of HIV with HPV-related tumorigenesis and risk of other AIDS-associated cancers. Hormonal/Obesity/inflammation research in CEP focuses extensively on the role of the insulin/IGF-axis, sex hormones, adipocytokines, and related pathways in obesity-associated cancers (e.g., colon, breast, prostate, etc.). This includes prospective studies of tumor incidence/recurrence/progression and their relation with circulating and local tissue levels of proteins in these pathways and the expression of their receptors. Given the US obesity epidemic these studies are timely, and will contribute to ongoing efforts to identify biomarkers in these pathways that can be used for patient risk stratification, and/or as targets for chemoprevention and treatment. Genetic and Epigenetic research in CEP focuses extensively on germline and somatic mutations, genetic polymorphisms, DNA methylation, and microRNAs. These studies examine the signaling pathways related to oncogenesis, tumor biomarkers important for selecting and developing targeted therapies, and genetic/epigenetic risk factors that can be used for patient risk stratification. CEP investigators are also conducting methodologic studies to improve the laboratory and statistical tools available for conducting genetic and epigenetic research. The CEP currently has 26 members from 11 departments, of whom 11 are new members, supported by 15 NCI grants ($3.7M Direct), and 11 other peer-reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($2.7M Direct). Since the last CCSG review there have been 414 cancer-relevant research papers in the CEP of which 29% represent intraprogrammatic and 18% represent interprogrammatic publications."

"9125769","Glioblastomas are notoriously insensitive to radiation and genotoxic drugs. Paradoxically, the p53 gene is structurally intact in the majority (~75%) of these tumors. Resistance to genotoxic modalities in p53-intact gliomas has been attributed to attenuation of p53 functions by other mutations within a p53 signaling axis that includes CDKN2A(p14 Arf), MDM2 and ATM. In preliminary studies, we have generated an alternative and potentially actionable resolution to the p53 paradox. Put briefly, we have shown that the gliogenic transcription factor OLIG2 suppresses p53-mediated responses to genotoxic damage in glioblastoma cells.  Against this backdrop, the broad objective of studies proposed in this SPORE project is to use clinical  materials to test the hypothesis that small molecule inhibitors of OLIG2 could serve as targeted therapeutics  for glioblastoma - either as stand alone modalities or (more likely) as adjuvants to radiotherapy and  genotoxic drugs. This hypothesis makes four testable predictions: Our first specific aim is to test the  prediction that current standard of care (radiation and Temozolomide) actually enriches for OLIG2-positive  cells within p53-positive glioblastomas. Our second specific aim is to test the prediction that one current  class of radiosensifizing drugs - the HDAC inhibitors - actually work by suppressing OLIG2 expression in  cancer patients. Our third specific aim is to test the prediction that genetic suppression of OL1G2 can  sensitize p53-positive human gliomas to radiotherapy in vivo. Our fourth specific aim is to test the  prediction that shRNA-mediated knockdown of genes essential to OLIG2 function (e.g. HDACs) will be  synthetic lethal to irradiation in p53 positive gliomas.  The basic scientist on this project (CD Stiles, PhD) is a molecular biologist and the clinical investigator  (JS Loeffler) is a radiation oncologist. Dr Stiles and his students initially cloned the OLIG genes and defined  their biological functions in brain development and malignant glioma. Dr Loeffier is a leader in the field of  brain tumor irradiation with a special interest in glioblastomas. Together they have the skill sets required for  successful completion ofthe study plan. The work they propose will be supported by dedicated SPORE core  facilities for Pathology and Biostatistics. If the work described here supports the view that OLIG2 is a viable  target for glioma therapeutics, clinical trials of OLIG2 antagonists (e.g. HDAC inhibitors) as an adjuvant to  radiotherapy can be initiated within a five-year period of time."

"9094432","Alterations in eicosanoid production play a complex role in cancers, including lung cancer. Preclinical studies  from our group have demonstrated that increased levels of prostacyclin (PGI2) are chemopreventive in multiple  models of lung cancer. Furthermore, the orally active PG12 analog iloprost has both chemopreventive and  chemotherapeutic activity in mouse models of lung cancer. These studies resulted in a double-blind, placebo  controlled clinical chemoprevention trial in which patients at high risk for lung cancer were treated with iloprost.  This trial demonstrated significant reversal of endobronchial dysplasia in ex-smokers, one of the few  chemopreventive trials to show a positive effect. There are cun-ently plans to move forward PGI2 analogs in a  larger Phase ll/Phase III trial examining the prevention of lung cancer. We demonstrated that the protective  effects of PGI2 were independent of the cell surface receptor, but were mediated through activation of the  nuclear receptor PPARy. These studies, along with retrospective studies showing reduced incidence of lung  cancer in patients taking thiazolidinediones (TZDs), resulted in a second, ongoing clinical trial assessing the role  of the TZD pioglitazone in patients at risk for lung cancer (PIOuS trial). The goal of the current proposal is to  examine PGI2 analogs and define the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of PGI2 analogs  and pioglitazone. Three specific aims are proposed. Due to the discontinuance of oral iloprost. Aim 1 will test the  preventive and therapeutic effects of two novel PGI2 analogs, treprostinil and inhaled iloprost. Aim 2 will define  the cellular and molecular targets of PGI2 and PPARy. Alterations in inflammatory cells will be examined in  mouse models and biopsies from clinical trials to determine if changes in these cell populations are associated  with response. In murine models, targeted deletions of PPARy in myeloid cells and epithelial cells will be used to  define the critical target cell mediating the chemopreventive response of PGI2 and PPARy. Our studies have  demonstrated that expression of the Wnt receptor Frizzled 9 (Fzd9) is necessary for growrth inhibition and  activation of PPARy in human NSCLC. The role of Fzd9 in mediating the chemopreventive effects of PGI2 will  be determined using Fzd9 knockout mice. Finally, Aim 3 will examine samples from both the completed iloprost  trial and the PIOuS trial to develop both prognostic biomarkers that characterize dysplasia risk and predictive  biomarkers for response to lloprost and PPARy modifying therapies. We expect that completion of these aims  will provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulated by these agents, and lead to novel  targets for chemoprevention. as well as define criteria for patient selection in future Phase ll/lll trials using these  agents to prevent lung cancer.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Based on preclinical studies performed in this project, prostacyclin analogs and activators of PPARy have  shown great promise as chemopreventive agents in patients at risk for lung cancer. The goal of this project  is to determine the mechanisms of action of these agents, and to define biomarkers in biopsies from patients  in order to develop a better strategy for targeted personalized chemoprevention of lung cancer."
"9093724","The long term goal of this project is to identify the patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who are the most likely to respond to decitabine therapy. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that has efficacy in both MDS and AML. It can be given as an outpatient, and it is well tolerated in most patients. However, response rates are modest; even with modern aggressive schedules, only 4 5 % of patients achieve a complete response. The molecular basis of decitabine sensitivity and/or resistance is not yet clear.  Specific Aims:  Aim1. We will define the molecular signature of decitabine responders. We will prospectively bank 125 properly consented patients treated with the current state-of-the-art decitabine protocol. We will comprehensively define patient-specific molecular signatures through exome sequencing and expression profiling, using both mRNA and miRNA based arrays. We will correlate genotyping and expression results with clinical features, including responsiveness to decitabine therapy. These studies will correlate genomic signatures of DNMT3A, I D H I , IDH2, and TET2 with outcomes. In addition, comprehensive, unbiased analysis will determine whether specific molecular signatures are associated with decitabine responses.  Aim 2. We will determine whether the rate of AML clearance and persistence of AML-associated subclones corresponds to drug metabolism, molecular, and/or clinical features of AML in each case. We will assess the velocity of patient-specific mutation clearance on day 0, 10, and 28, and the persistence of AML-associated subclones despite blast clearance. We will correlate this with steady-state decitabine drug levels, the reduction of methylcytosine in the total marrow sample (a biomarker of effective dosing), and with clinical response rates and event-free survival."
"9105316","The colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor (CSF-IR) kinase instructs multipotent hematopoietic cells  to adopt a macrophage fate and regulates the functions of differentiated cells. Previous results from this  program have shown that CSF-1-driven tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) regulate angiogenesis,  carcinoma cell invasion, intravasation and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer. TAM production of  angiogenic factors and cytokines, TAM migration and TAM promotion of carcinoma cell migration have been  identified as important CSF-1 R-mediated events. Our analysis of macrophage CSF-IR phosphotyrosyl  (pTyr) signaling pathways has shown that CSF-1 R pTyr pathways control CSF-1-regulated proliferation,  whereas other pTyr pathways regulate differentiation, morphology and motility. In particular, we have shown  that the pTyr-721 pathway is critical for the paracrine interaction between macrophages and carcinoma cells  in vitro and for macrophage motility within the tumor in vivo, for the production of angiogenic factors and for  the release of EGF that participates in a paracrine loop to activate tumor cell invasiveness. Thus we  hvpothesize that the CSF-IR pTyr-721 signaling pathways function in TAMs to regulate TAM promotion of  carcinoma cell progression and metastasis. The overall aim of Proiect 2 is to confirm this by direct in vivo  analysis, to determine when and where macrophage enhancement of tumor progression mediated by CSF-  1R pTyr-721 signaling is occurring and to identify the downstream pathways involved. To test this  hypothesis, we propose a comprehensive approach involving three specific alms. In the first aim, we will  establish the in vivo roles of CSF-1 R pTyr-721 signaling in mouse mammary tumor progression and  metastasis using novel imaging approaches. In the second aim, CSF-IR pTyr-721-dependent signaling  molecules and macrophage-produced cytokines that have been identified using combination of approaches  will be examined in vitro using newly developed assays that accurately mimic the paracrine interaction and  TAM-mediated tumor cell Intravasation and extravasation. In the third aim, molecules selected on the basis  of these in vitro functional assays will be examined for their in vivo roles In tumor progression and  metastasis. Their clinical significance will be determined by immunohistochemistry of human CDP Breast  Cancer Progression Tissue Microarrays (TMA) and using patient samples in collaboration with Project 5.  These studies are expected to provide in vivo data concerning the function of selected signaling molecules  that act in CSF-IR downstream signaling pathways in TAMs to effect tumor progression and metastasis.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):   The results of the proposed work will enhance our understanding of why anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g.  CSF-IR inhibitors) are protective against cancer incidence and progression and are expected to provide in  vivo data concerning the function of signaling molecules that act in TAMs to effect tumor progression and  metastasis. They are also expected to lead to the identification of new targets for diagnostic tests in man and  to preclinical studies testing novel therapeutic approaches."
"9149428","Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Shared Resource:   Project Summary   Chemistry Shared Resource Group   In 2013, the broad range of services and collaborative work provided by the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  Shared Resource (NMR-SR) supported the research of 24 Purdue Center for Cancer Research (PCCR)  members' laboratories, representing all four Research Programs. The value of the NMR-SR's services to the  PCCR membership is critical because these instruments provide wide-ranging NMR capabilities which  effectively serve the needs of PCCR's multi-disciplinary faculty. In the absence of the NMR-SR and its  experienced staff, these investigators would not have rapid access to spectrometers that support both routine  use and complex problems. The demand for NMR must be met locally as it is generally impractical for NMR  spectroscopy to be done through an outside service. The synthetic chemist requires access to an NMR  spectrometer on a daily basis and immediate knowledge of the results. It is also important that the structural  biologist have routine access to characterize protein samples, execute titrations, and conduct the large number  of experiments required for structure determination.   The NMR-SR staff oversees ten NMR spectrometers ranging in field strength from 300 MHz to 800 MHz.  All spectrometers are available 24/7 on a charge-back basis to individual researchers in the capacity of either  `walk-on' usage as required by synthetic chemists, or long-term reservations as needed for biological NMR  spectroscopy. The NMR-SR spectrometers are able to perform the entire gamut of modern NMR techniques  needed by PCCR investigators in areas of chemistry and medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and  biological/biomedical engineering. The available instrumentation and expertise provide convenient, reliable  and cost-effective service to multi-disciplinary research in areas as diverse as protein and structural biology,  organic chemistry, and metabolomics.   The NMR-SR has qualified personnel from Ph.D.-level scientific knowledge of NMR spectroscopy to  service, repair of magnets, electronics and information technology (IT). In addition, Purdue's NMR-SR staff  excels in training new users and provides the expertise in the NMR-SR for supporting this necessary  collaborative research. Overall, through its PCCR and institutionally supported facilities and staff, the NMR-SR  provides a convenient, reliable and cost-effective service for PCCR members."

"9143719","Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) carries a poor survival due to lack of effective drug treatment. This project will  address this barrier through the development of new therapeutic strategies for drug treatment of PaCa based  upon the targeting of newly identified molecules as targets for maintaining the survival of PaCa cells using  emerging novel drugs. We will test these emerging drugs in human pancreatic cancer cells grown in  immunosuppressed mice to demonstrate the feasibility that effective combination strategies tailored for the  Smad4 wild type (WT) and mutant (MT) subgroups of PaCa, respectively, can be developed. The strategies  are based upon description of a cell survival mechanism in which a pro-survival protein complex consisting  of survivin and XIAP inhibits the executioner caspase enzymes that would normally kill cancer cells undergoing  the stress of the cancer micro-environment. Our laboratory has found that the mutation of Smad4  leads to the overproduction of a cell surface protein called RonK that in turn generates the activation of  enzymes that modify the survivin/XIAP complex to enhance its stability and thereby make the inhibition of  caspases more efficient. Consequently, one arm of the strategy for the Smad4 MT subgroup (approximately  50% of PaCa) will be the inhibition of the Met family tyrosine kinase receptor RonK by a newly developed  monoclonal antibody from Imclone (IMC-Ron8). Treatment will be coupled with YM155, a first-in-its-class  inhibitor of survivin, which has been shown to disrupt the stabilization of survivin/XIAP complexes that then  permits the function of caspases in generating cell death. The second subgroup is Smad4 WT, which  represents the other half of the disease, will be addressed by a strategy that takes advantage of Smad4  function using a drug that cause re-expression of a tumor suppressor gene called TGF? receptor II. The  drug, Belinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor reverses the epigenetic signaling pathway that stabilizes  both survivin and XIAP. The Smad4 WT subgroup will also be treated in combination with YM155 to directly  attack the expression of survivin. Both strategies will be tested in immunosuppressed mice using pancreatic  cancer xenografts in order to learn how best to administrate these drugs to pancreatic cancer patients."
"9126428","Multiple factors in the cancer microenvironment down-regulate tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. In melanoma, one of the dominant mechanisms is the induction of co-inhibitory receptors on tumor-specific T cells and expression of corresponding co-inhibitory ligands by tumor or other cells within tumor stroma, leading to complete or partial loss of T-cell effector functions. Amplified co-inhibitory interactions in the cancer microenvironment impede not only immune tumor surveillance, but also therapeutic immune interventions that may explain the failure of approaches aimed at stimulation of T cells, including tumor antigen-based vaccination and T cell stimulatory cytokines. A prime example of the co-inhibitory interactions is the B7-H1 (PD-L1)/PD-1 pathway. Early studies from our and other laboratories demonstrate a critical role of this pathway in the evasion of cancer immunity, and blockade of this pathway enhances ongoing immune responses against tumors. Recent phase I clinical trials conducted using a fully human antibody to PD-1 demonstrated durable objective (partial and complete) responses in 33% of pretreated metastatic melanoma patients (n=46). Collectively, these studies support B7-H1 as an important co-inhibitory molecule in the down-regulation of immune responses in the melanoma microenvironment and blockade of the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway as one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of melanoma. Project 2 will extend these laboratory and clinical findings in three directions; The specific aims are: Aim 1: to assess the association between B7-H1/PD-1 expression in human melanoma microenvironment with clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy; Aim 2: to study effector mechanisms of the B7-H1/PD-1 blockade in augmenting anti-melanoma immunity and in melanoma regression; and Aim 3: to maximize melanoma therapeutic immunity by mechanism-based combinatory approaches. Based on our finding that B7-H1 expression by melanoma is directly and extensively up-regulated by interferons, the combination of B7-H1/PD-1 blockade will be tested with IL-2 and interferon-a 2b, and with selective mutant BRAF inhibitors, which promote tumor T-cell infiltration. Our studies should have direct impact for current development of B7-H1/PD-1 blockade as a novel and promising approach for melanoma therapy."

"9093726","The outcome of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poor. While 90% of adult patients  will achieve an initial remission with chemotherapy, the majority will relapse and only 30-40% will achieve  long-term disease free survival. Evidence suggests that similar to normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor  cells, leukemic cells receive key growth and survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment.  Moreover, direct physical interaction of leukemic cells with stromal cells in the bone marrow may limit their  sensitivity to chemotherapy. Thus, targeting leukemia-stromal interactions is an emerging and promising  strategy to sensitize leukemic cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy.   Preclinical studies performed by our group suggest that treatment with granulocyte-stimulating factor (G-  CSF) provides a potent and well-tolerated method to disrupt the leukemia niche in the bone marrow. Indeed,  treatment with G-CSF prior to initiating chemotherapy augments clearance of ALL cells in mice. We initiated  a pilot clinical trial of upfront G-CSF treatment prior to salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed ALL.  Preliminary data show that G-CSF induces mobilization of ALL cells into the blood, while inducing apoptosis  of ALL cells resident in the bone marrow. There is strong evidence that CXCL12 provides a key survival  signal for normal and malignant lymphocytes. Preliminary data show that treatment with POL5551, a novel  and potent CXCR4 antagonist, mobilizes ALL cells into the blood in mice and renders them more sensitive to  chemotherapy. Since G-CSF results in only partial suppression of CXCL12 in the bone marrow, we  hypothesize that treatment with G-CSF and a CXCR4 antagonist will cooperate to disrupt leukemia-stromal  cell signals, rendering ALL cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. The following specific aims are proposed.   Aim 1. To optimize strategies to disrupt the leukemic niche in the bone marrow and sensitize human ALL  cells to chemotherapy.   Aim 2. To test the feasibility of priming with G-CSF and POL6326 with chemotherapy in adults with  relapsed or refractory ALL.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This proposed research is relevant to public health because it seeks to translate fundamental observations  on the effects of G-CSF and CXCR signalling in to an early phase clinical trial with an overall goal of  improving the clinical outcomes of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia."

"9340310","Project 3 addresses the problems of (i) opportunistic viral infection and (ii) relapse of B-lineage malignancies after umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). We hypothesize that the incidence of viral infection and leukemia relapse following allogeneic UCBT can be reduced by adoptively transferred donor-derived multi virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), genetically modified (transduced) to be specific for the CD19 molecule expressed by leukemic cells. To consolidate UCBT we have designed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to redirect antigen specificity of T cells to the B cell lineage-restricted cell-surface molecule CD19 The virus-specific CTLs from Project 2 will be transduced to express this CAR, resulting in MHC-independent and CAR-dependent activation through chimeric CD28 and CD3-zeta to lyse lymphoid cells, upregulate IL-2, and anti-apoptotic genes in response to CD19. The studies proposed in Specific Aim #1 will evaluate whether UCB-derived multivirus-specific CTLs can be rendered specific for GDI 9 and whether HSV-1 thymidine kinase transgene can be expressed for imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) in immunodeficient mice. Adoptive immunotherapy using non-invasive bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and micro PET will longitudinally asses the persistence of the infused cells, and the anti-tumor effect. Specific Aim #2 will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and persistence of infusing multivirus-specific CTLs modified to express CAR CD19-specific after UCBT. The correlative studies will delineate the (i) magnitude and duration of persistence, (ii) trafficking, and (iii) anti-viral and anti-leukemic effects of adoptively transferred CTLs. In preparation for human PET T-cell imaging, in Specific Aim #3, we will develop a nonhuman primate model Monkey-derived T cells will be genetically modified with CARs and TK, and infused. Longitudinal PET imaging using [18FJFEAU, metabolized by thymidine kinase (TK) will be used to evaluate the distribution of these adoptively transferred macaque T cells. In aggregate, the results of the studies will facilitate the evolution of targeting post-UCBT MRD with viral- and CD19-specific CTLs for enhanced disease-free survival of patients with B cell malignancies."

"8997374","Project-3: (Weill Cornell Medical College and MSK)  Translating Stress Response Targeted Therapy for B-Cell Lymphomas  John Leonard/Clinical and Ari Melnick/Translational/Basic  PROJECT SUMMARY  Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies, the complexity of which  still remains to be fully resolved. At least 30-40% of patients are not cured with current chemo-immunotherapy  regimens. Improved treatments are urgently needed for these patients. Chemotherapy resistance and relapse  are particularly high in patients with certain molecular features, such as those with an ?Activated B-cell (ABC)?  like gene expression signature, or those with translocations or overexpression of the MYC and BCL2  oncogenes (so-called ?double-hit? DLBCLs). Even when cured our current best therapies are highly toxic and  carry a significant risk of inducing secondary cancers. Our research seeks to identify fundamental biological  mechanisms that drive the survival of DLBCLs including its resistant subtypes. Along these lines we find that  DLBCLs are generally addicted to particular stress response proteins. A tumor-enriched form of Hsp90 (TE-  Hsp90) plays an essential role in DLBCLs by supporting the actions of the BCL6, MYC and BCL2  oncoproteins, as well as maintaining B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Our team developed a small molecule  that selectively inhibits TE-Hsp90 without affecting general Hsp90 housekeeping functions. This molecule,  called PUH71 has an accordingly wide therapeutic window and potent activity against DLBCL cells. PUH71 is  well tolerated in our phase I clinical trial. We developed a method to accurately measure tumor exposure  through PET imaging of I124-labeled PUH71, which may serve as a companion biomarker to guide  individualized dosing and interpret clinical responses. We hypothesize that PUH71 can serve as an effective  therapeutic agent for DLBCL, including those with ABC- and double-hit molecular signatures. We predict that  response can be predicted through PUH71 imaging and biologic biomarkers. We predict that PUH71 will serve  as a platform drug for development of effective and well-tolerated combinatorial therapy regimens. Finally, we  also developed YK198, a potent and specific inhibitor of specific allosteric states of Hsp70, with activity against  DLBCL cells at least in part due to disruption of anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. We hypothesize that Hsp70  inhibitors will be useful therapeutic agents for DLBCL and may overcome possible PUH71 induced Hsp70  feedback resistance. Therefore we propose to perform a PUH71 phase II clinical trial in patients with DLBCL  with concordant imaging and biomarker studies, to compare and contrast biological dependency of Hsp90 and  Hsp70 inhibitors in DLBCL patient specimens, and to design and test rational combinatorial regimens with  PUH71 and YK198."

"9105320","Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and the leading cause of cancer  related death. More than 1.2 million cases are diagnosed every year, affecting 10-12% of the female  population and accounting for approximately 500,000 deaths per year worldwide. The primary cause of  morbidity and mortality in women with breast cancer is metastasis. We currently do not have the technology  to identify breast cancer patients with localized and regional disease who are at risk for metastatic disease.  As a result, 80% of patients receive aggressive treatment that is necessary for patients with advanced breast  cancer, although only about 10 to 15% of patients develop metastasis within 3 years of diagnosis. Given the  significant short- and long-term complications of chemo- and radiotherapy, and its impact on quality of life of  survivors, development of prognostic markers of metastasis and identification of anti-metastatic targets  would greatly benefit women with breast cancer. The prognostic factors in current use include the number of  positive lymph nodes, tumor size, grade and receptor status, and Mammaprint and OncotypeDX. Although  all of these tools are in use in the management of breast cancer patients, they are derived from molecular  sub-typing of whole tumor tissue and give no information about the presence of migratory and disseminating  tumor cells within the tumor tissue as well as little insight into the specific mechanisms of metastasis. Hence,  it is not clear how to improve their use within personalized treatment plans concerning risk and treatment  response of metastasis.   To define the mechanisms responsible for tumor cell migration and dissemination to distant sites, we  developed multiphoton microscopes for observing and collecting the migratory and metastatic tumor cells  from mammary tumors In live mice in real time. Using this technology we observed the importance of tumor  cell-macrophage interactions in metastasis and discovered the human invasion signature (HIS), the  expression profile of tumor cells during metastatic dissemination. We also identified the sites of tumor cell  intravaation used for dissemination in vivo and named them TMEM for the Tumor MicroEnvironment of  Metastasis. We hypothesize that tumor cells with increased activation of the pathways in the HIS can  assemble TMEM, thereby increasing Intravasation. We have developed methods to measure the activation  of the migration, adhesion and invadopod assembly pathways within the HIS and both intravasation and  extravasation activities in vitro and in vivo which will allow us to test this hypothesis.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The results of testing the hypothesis that tumor cells with increased activation of the pathways in the HIS  can assemble TMEM, thereby increasing intravasation, have a high potential of being translational by  application to determine risk of distant recurrence, and to personalize management of breast cancer patients  at risk for metastatic disease.

Accordingly, Myc+/Bcl2+ expression defines a subset of patients with DLBCL with a clear unmet  medical need. The goal of this project is to develop novel mechanism-based therapy to improve the cure rate  of patients with Myc+/Bcl2+ DLBCL. To do that, we will capitalize on the recent knowledge reported by our  group and others demonstrating oncogenic cooperation between Myc and Bcl2, and Myc and activated PI3K  pathway that can be exploited by novel targeted approaches. As the development of drugs that can directly  inhibit Myc protein remains challenging, we will examine alternative approaches, including targeting Myc  transcription using HDAC inhibitors and bromodomain inhibitors, or Myc translation using inhibitors of  mTORC1 and the eIF4A RNA helicase. In Aim 1, we will investigate the contribution of protein translation to  Myc/Bcl2 expression In DLBCL. In Aim 2, we will perform preclinical experiments to develop novel  mechanism-based treatment strategies for Myc+/Bcl2+ DLBCL. In Aim 3, we will conduct phase I/II studies of  novel therapies developed from Aims 1 and 2 to evaluate their safety and efficacy in patients with Myc+/Bcl2+  DLBCL."
"9149424","Flow Cytometry and Cell Separation Shared Resource:   Project Summary   Biology Shared Resource Group   The Purdue Flow Cytometry and Cell Separation Shared Resource (FC-SR) provides advanced cell and  particle analysis, and sorting capabilities to Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) members.  As an analytical tool, flow cytometry allows users to identify and quantitate cellular features, organelles, or  structural components using optical measures. When combined with sorting capabilities, it is possible to  identify and isolate single cells that have specific properties or express specific molecules and which can then  be further examined and characterized. In cancer research, where the identification and characterization of  unique, specific cells with cancer-like characteristics is critical, flow cytometry and cell sorting are extremely  vital and useful to today's cancer researcher. Purdue's FC-SR provides a broad range of services that  supported 24 Purdue Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) investigators' research projects from all four of  PCCR's Research Programs in this current year.   The FC-SR, located in the Bindley Bioscience Center (BBC) of Discovery Park, has grown considerably in  both its technical expertise and instrument capabilities since its total re-organization in March 2009. A major  emphasis of the facility is live cell sorting of mouse and human cells under BSL-2 conditions. In 2010 with  support from an NIH S10 Shared Instrument Grant, the FC-SR obtained a high-throughput LEAP image  scanning cytometer. This instrument adds an additional dimension to sorting of attached cells by laser ablation  and serves as a bridge between flow cytometry and image analysis capabilities. The FC-SR also operates a  FACS Aria III Sorter that serves as the primary workhorse for analysis and cell sorting. Currently, the facilty  also operates a FC500 Cell Analyzer for routine cell analyses. The data analysis capabilities of the facility have  advanced greatly with the addition of many FlowJo site licenses and the development of new advanced data  analysis capabilities.   Perhaps the most important resource provided by the FC-SR is the expertise that the staff shares. Many of  FC-SR's clients have little, if any, experience conducting cytometry analysis or designing experiments using  the BD FACS Aria III cell sorter. In the absence of the FC-SR and its experienced staff, these investigators  would have tremendous difficulty in generating cytometry data necessary for competitive external funding."
"9120316","The University of Kansas Cancer Center requests CCSG funds for developmental funds to be specifically used for the pilot studies program and to supplement new recruitment packages.  The major purpose of the Pilot Studies Program is to provide support for highly innovative research proposals in new, exciting, and potentially breakthrough areas of cancer research. The pilot research proposal must be cancer-related and must not overlap with existing funding from any source (different focus and different aims).  Ultimately, the goal is to have these funds provide critical preliminary data to test new hypotheses and assess feasibility of ideas that might allow for rapid advancement in the field and make an impact in basic, clinical, or translational research. The merit of these proposals will be assessed by members of the KUCC-Leadership Council and approved by the Director prior to funding.  To actively build and improve our research environment, KUCC is committed to recruiting additional cancer researchers to increase the national and international status of the Cancer Center, enhance the number of NCI/cancer-related grants, fill critical research positions and build the four cancer research programs. Each purposeful hire aims to further the scientific vision, mission, and goals of the Cancer Center research programs. The funds requested will be used to supplement the recruitment packages of future cancer center recruits and will be leveraged by matching with Kansas Bioscience Authority funds."

"9001913","Genomics Shared Resource  Project Summary/Abstract  The GSR is an expansion of the highly successful Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) DNA  (deoxyribonucleic acid) Array Laboratory launched in 1998, which was one of the first microarray core  laboratories in the country. Initially, the resource was instrumental in assisting researchers in the development  of a number of novel microarray applications, including assays examining protein-DNA interactions, DNA  methylation profiling, and DNA replication timing patterns. The resource then transitioned from primarily  making custom spotted arrays to using several commercial array-based platforms. The DNA Array Lab was  later incorporated into a new entity - the Consortium Genomics Shared Resource - along with a newly  developed second laboratory, the Genetic Analysis Lab, which was developed to provide capillary-based  sequencing services (and years later also provide NextGen sequencing services). This expansion also  required an expansion of support infrastructure and instrumentation for the main service areas. A major  component of this infrastructure is HutchBASE, an in-house developed Laboratory Information and  Management System (LIMS) system that supports online ordering of services, sample tracking, data  management and analysis, and billing. The resource provides the highest quality services and expertise to aid  the genomics-based needs of Cancer Consortium members through its two laboratories.  The Genetic Analysis Laboratory provides:  ? Capillary-based and NextGen sequencing technologies;  ? Genotyping; and  ? Quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) services.  The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Array Laboratory provides Consortium members with end-to-end solutions for  array-based experimentation, including:  ? Consultation on technology selection;  ? Assistance with experimental design;  ? Assessment of RNA and DNA quality;  ? Troubleshooting support; and  ? Assistance with reviewing data quality and implementation of data analysis strategies."

"9107355","CLINICAL PROTOCOL & DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM)  ABSTRACT  The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) clinical component centrally manages the activation and  ongoing maintenance of all clinical research for the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC). The  CPDM is housed within the UNMCC Clinical Research Office and handles both clinical and population sciences  research at the Center and across the statewide New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA) clinical trial  network. The Executive Director of both the UNMCC Clinical Research Office and the NMCCA is Teresa  Stewart, MS, CRCP, MT (ASCP). The integration of the UNMCC Clinical Research Office and NMCCA provides  an enhanced centralized infrastructure for participation in NCI-sponsored trials funded through the New Mexico  Minority/Underserved National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), investigator  initiated trials, and industry sponsored trials. The CPDM lies within this outstanding infrastructure and is led by  its Medical Director, Melanie Royce, MD, PhD who is also the Director of the UNMCC Multidisciplinary Breast  Cancer Program, and the Principal Investigator of the NCORP grant (UG1CA189856). During the past four years,  the UNMCC Clinical Research Office average annual budget was $2.9 million of which the CPDM allocation was  $667,000. The CPDM administers an annual average of 345 clinical research studies across UNMCC and  NMCCA. The average time to open a clinical research study at the UNMCC and the NMCCA network was 14.1  weeks in the period 2010-2014 (with little fluctuation across each year) and was 46% faster than in 2009. From  January 2010 to June 2014, the UNMCC CPDM supported 3264 patient accruals to clinical research studies;  1628 patients accrued to interventional studies and 1636 patients to non-interventional studies (per Data Table  4 criteria). From January 2010 ? June 30, 2014, UNMCC CPDM enrolled 1226 subjects to therapeutic  intervention trials (per Data Table 3 criteria), this represents an average therapeutic trial enrollment of 16.6% of  newly diagnosed and/or treated UNMCC patients over the four and a half year period. UNMCC patient accrual  numbers to all clinical research managed by CPDM were: 483 (first six months of 2014); 617 (2013), 727 (2012),  772 (2011) and 665 (2010). Based on data from 2013: 1) 67.9% of the accrued patients were female while the  cancer incidence for women in New Mexico is only 49.3%, 2) 40.6% of the patients accruals were Hispanic while  the cancer incidence for Hispanics in New Mexico is just 29.2%, and 3) 8.5% of the patient accruals were  American Indian while the cancer incidence in New Mexico among American Indians is 5.0%. Thus, the UNMCC  continues to enroll women and minorities at rates that exceed the New Mexico cancer incidence among these  specific populations, demonstrating commitment to the State's underserved populations and congruence with  the UNMCC scientific missions."

Our track record of success is exemplary. For example, two prior GI SPORE career development recipients (designated Scholars) have leadership roles in this competitive renewal (Ethan Lee, Co-Investigator Project 1; Harvey Murff, Clinical PI Project 4). Scholars are selected via two established mechanisms: the Vanderbilt Physician Scientist Development (VPSD) Award and the GI SPORE Career Opportunity Award (COA). The VPSD track is designed for junior faculty with an MD or MD/PhD degree who are provided two years of support with 75% time for research and training. The COA track is more flexible and provides one to two years of support to MDs and/or PhDs at any level. It is designed to attract junior PhD investigators to enter GI cancer research and to encourage established investigators to transition to GI cancer research. Training in both tracks is tailored to the individual investigator, is overseen by the CDP Mentoring Panel and is supported by myriad institutional resources that assure our Scholars thrive. Scholars form an interdisciplinary mentoring committee, participate in regular work-in-progress presentations, receive formal evaluation each year, participate in a twice-monthly career development seminar series and are regulariy exposed to case studies on responsible conduct of research. They have access to: 1) biostatistics consultation; 2) manuscript preparation workgroups; 3) technical editing of completed products; 3) studios with experts to vet scientific ideas, research designs and aims; 4) robust intramural pilot and feasibility funding; and 5) grant writing support, including grant workshops, a funded grant library and mock study sections.

"9143718","Despite being a staple therapy for pancreatic cancer (PC), Radiation Therapy (RT) provides limited objective  clinical response due to inherently high radioresistance (RR) of PC. As the risk of radiation-induced toxicity  for PC patients far outweighs the therapeutic benefits attained, effective methods to improve the  radiosensitivity of PC are urgently needed. The overall objective of this project is to identify and characterize  pathway(s) contributing to RR in PC that can be explored as novel targets for radiosensitization (RS).  Preliminary global gene expression analysis suggested novel involvement of cholesterol biosynthesis  pathway in the RR in PC cells. Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis (CBS) by Zoledronic acid (Zometa)  resulted in RS of panel of RR murine and human PC cells. Further, this RS was recapitulated by the  inhibition of the small GTPase Rac1, whose activity is controlled by the CBS pathway. Therefore, we seek to  delineate mechanisms of RR mediated by cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and evaluate the potential of  Zometa as a radiosensitizer (RST) in preclinical and clinical studies. We propose to exploit the strength of  stereotactic radiation therapy and genetically engineered mouse models to comprehensively test the  hypothesis that ?cholesterol biosynthesis pathway contributes to radioresistance in PC and Zometa inhibits  specific pathways consistently implicated in RR and its use will radiosensitize PC both in vitro and in vivo?.  To achieve our goal, three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanisms of  radioresistance in PC and validation of FDPS/Rac1 inhibitors (Zometa and NSC23766) as RSTs. The  functional role of critical genes identified will be determined by knockdown and overexpression studies, use  of specific inhibitors, and immunohistochemistry on clinical samples. Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of  Zometa as RST in mouse models (xenograft and autochthonous). A novel strategy of stereotactic irradiation  for murine models will be developed. In Aim 3, a Phase-I/II study will be undertaken to assess the  radiosensitizing potential of Zometa in human subjects and determine if Zometa is well tolerated in PC  patients undergoing RT."

The guidelines and protocols for collecting  specimens established by the UNMC Tumor Bank and the Institutional Review Board are followed for the  SPORE proposal. This core facility stores normal, benign (i.e. acute and/or chronic fibrosing pancreatitis)  and malignant pancreatic tissues (including both primary and metastatic pancreatic carcinomas) and  peripheral blood lymphocytes, plasma and serum from patients undergoing surgical procedures for  pancreatic malignancies and from deceased patients with history of pancreatic cancer (rapid autopsy). The  Bank also coordinates collection and storage of cytopathologic brushing or aspiration specimens of  pancreatic ductal or pancreatic mass lesions. Cytogenetic analysis with storage of short-term cultured cells is  performed on malignant lesions when possible. The core includes a mechanism for database management  and specimen distribution. A uniform system of prioritization of requested materials has been defined and  used by the Pancreas Tumor SPORE Tissue Bank Oversight Committee. This core facility is intended to  benefit the specific research activities of the SPORE, as well as the research activities of other scientists  within and outside of UNMC who are concentrating on translational research issues. Additionally, tissues are  available for distribution through NCI supported tissue networks in national prioritization.  Only specimens obtained from clinically indicated surgeries after all other diagnostic procedures have  been performed are submitted to the Pancreas Tumor SPORE Tissue Bank for translational research. The  specimens would otherwise be discarded or disposed of. Eligible patients have the opportunity to participate  by submitting written informed consent. There is no risk to the patient or compromise to the patient's care,  since all of the procedures performed would be performed for diagnostic reasons regardless of the SPORE."
"9094440","The goal of the Career Development Program is to prepare new investigators for independent careers in translational lung cancer research. It is expected that awardees will spend 1 to 2 years in a productive scientific environment with SPORE support and mentoring, after which time they will establish independent programs in research related to lung cancer. The Career Development Committee annually reviews the progress of each awardee by reviewing written reports, attending research presentations and through discussions with the awardee and the awardee's mentor. The Committee also solicits applications for new awardees. This is done by campus-wide communications, by personally approaching promising candidates, and by soliciting input from SPORE investigators. Applicants submit a proposed course of research that is reviewed by the committee. The committee also interviews applicants and mentors. The central criterion for selection of candidates is that they be junior investigators who are likely to develop independent careers in lung cancer research. Awardees are selected primarily for their potential for a successful career in independent research, secondarily for the mentor's laboratory or clinical project in which they propose to work (if not their own laboratory), and finally for the quality of the research proposal. All factors are critical for selection. However, as the ultimate goal of the program is to develop new investigators for independent careers in lung cancer research, an outstanding mentor and project cannot make up for a candidate with lesser personal and academic characteristics. Efforts are made to attract minority and female candidates. Awardees present yearly at the SPORE Program Seminar Series, with the mentor and SPORE Executive Committee members present. The presentation is followed by a discussion between the awardee, mentor and the Executive Committee.    The SPORE Executive Committee which makes the final selection of awardees based on the CDP Committee's recommendations. For the renewal period we are requesting $50,000 grant support which will be matched with $50,000 of institutional funds to allow on average funding of two awardees per year. We believe the program has been successful. In the past 2 grant cycles, we have supported 10 awardees, in addition to two recent awards. All of the 10 continue in lung cancer research; 3/10 are under-represented minorities and 3/10 are women.

"9149754","ABSTRACT ? DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS  Developmental Funds are critical for implementing and advancing strategic initiatives and addressing the  growing needs of the SBMRI Cancer Center. Requests for Developmental Funds undergo a scientific planning  and evaluation process by the Cancer Center Leadership Team (CCLT), and the final decision to approve  funding is made by the Cancer Center Director. Developmental Funds are often combined with, and used to  leverage, institutional and philanthropic support, thereby maximizing their impact. During the last funding  period, CCSG Developmental Funds were used to hire 5 new faculty who added expertise in the fields of  cancer metabolism, cancer stem cells, cancer epigenetics and cancer therapeutics, fulfilling goals that were set  in our previous strategic plan. Recruitment of these faculty members was also made possible by support from  SBMRI as part of its ongoing commitment to the success of the Cancer Center, and included fully funding the  recruitment of 4 additional faculty with expertise in cancer ER stress, non-coding RNAs, the microbiome and  immunology/inflammation. Together, these recruits have successfully obtained peer-reviewed funding during  this past CCSG funding period, with total direct grant revenue of $37.8M, representing a ratio of 25:1 for  external grant awards relative to CCSG investment. The CCSG Developmental Funds also supported 14 new  collaborative pilot projects, driven by Cancer Center investigators during the last funding period, as well as  continuing support for 2 pilot projects initiated in the prior funding cycle. Projects funded by this program have  brought together scientists with diverse expertise and introduced a new cadre of scientists to cancer research.  Developmental Funds have also been used to fund 4 milestone driven translational therapeutic development  pilot grants through a new program called STRIVE (Sanford-Burnham Translational Initiative Venture  Enterprise). In this program we engage our local biotech/pharma community to provide advice on how best to  translate our discoveries into new agents and therapies for cancer. Thus, the pilot projects offer a tangible  mechanism for promoting research in priority areas established by the Cancer Center leadership strategic plan.  Support is requested for 5 collaborative pilot projects, including STRIVE translational projects annually. A  recent initiative supported by CCSG Developmental Funds is the development of a new Shared Resource in  Cancer Metabolism. During the next project period, we plan to recruit 10 new investigators based on the  Cancer Center's new 5-year Strategic Plan, focusing on the priority areas designated by each of the three  programs. We are requesting CCSG support for two new faculty members per year at an approximate cost of  less than 15% of the expected total recruitment cost.

"9149755","5.1 Abstract - ANIMAL RESOURCES (Core Group A)  The Animal Resources Shared Resource (Core Group A), an AAALAC-accredited facility since 1988,  provides a comprehensive animal care and use program for all SBMRI scientists utilizing animals in their  research. Core personnel work closely with the veterinarian and the IACUC to facilitate establishment of  effective/productive animal protocols and to ensure efficient and humane use of animals. Encompassing over  23,000 sq. ft. in four buildings, the Core currently employs a well-trained staff of 28 FTEs. The Core houses  over 600 unique lines of transgenic and knockout mice, as well as a small number of rats and frogs, with a  maximum mouse housing capacity of 14,000 ventilated cages. The Core provides 5 basic types of services: 1)  animal husbandry, 2) breeding colony maintenance and administrative support, 3) mouse reproductive  services, 4) in vivo imaging and tumor analysis, and 5) technical support. While recognizing the need for  investigators to perform certain specialized procedures, the Core attempts as much as possible to be a full-  service resource in terms of routine procedures. Education and training represent an important role of the  Core, which provides free training for scientists on routine and specialized procedures and the use of relevant  imaging and analysis equipment. Scientific personnel also benefit from participation in Core-hosted, in-house  presentations on topics relevant to the use of mouse models. The Core intranet website provides access to the  web-based animal colony management software, the IACUC protocol database, IACUC policies, SOPs,  industry resources and training modules. Investigators from all three Cancer Center programs make extensive  use of the Animal Resources Core, studying more than a dozen different types of cancer using both xenograft  and mouse genetic models. The Tumor Analysis service is a key resource in this respect, providing access to a  variety of xenograft models, including patient-derived xenografts. This service is supported by an array of  sophisticated imaging modalities for evaluating tumor progression, including luminescence, fluorescence, and  ultrasound. Additional Animal Analysis services include blood cell, serum, behavioral, and metabolic analysis.  Animal models allow Cancer Center investigators to address a range of topics including mutations and genetic  drivers responsible for malignancy, understanding the signaling pathways affected by these mutations, defining  the properties and role of cancer stem cells, investigation of the interplay between tumor cells and the tumor  microenvironment, probing mechanisms that underlie tumor invasion and metastasis from the primary tumor  site, development of drugs to block various aspects of tumor cell biology, and devising ways to circumvent  tumor resistance to therapy. In the past year (GY32), a total of 34 Cancer Center laboratories utilized vivarium  services. During the past funding period, work in the vivarium supported the publication of over 127 papers  with direct relevance to these areas of cancer research."
"9149759","5.5 Abstract - GENOMICS (Group B Core)  The Genomics Shared Resource (Core Group B) operates as a full service nucleic acid to data facility,  guiding investigators to the most appropriate technology for their experimental analysis, including next-  generation sequencing (NGS), microarrays, NanoString, or Q-PCR. The Core has two major areas of focus.  These are DNA Analysis, providing high throughput sequencing and data analysis, and Microarray/Q-PCR  effort, providing Illumina-based microarray analysis, as well as full-service real-time PCR analysis. During the  last funding period the DNA Analysis Core has added significant NGS capacity and personnel, and is now  primarily focused on providing NGS services for Cancer Center investigators. Additionally, the previously  separate microarray/QPCR and DNA analysis facilities have been co-located and operationally combined to  augment NGS capacity, and streamline service. For NGS projects, the Core provides a complete sample-to-  analyzed data service. Such data outputs include differential expression and differential splicing analysis for  RNA-seq projects, and annotated variant calls for DNA-seq projects. Enhancements in NGS technology  include the addition of an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM), an Ion Proton sequencer, and an Ion  Chef Sample preparation system. The Ion Proton sequencer currently has the capacity to sequence 20 human  exomes or 30 transcriptomes per week. The PGM has been popular for sequencing targeted gene panels  (e.g., Cancer AmpliSeq panels) and small genomes. In addition, a new DNA Analysis Core director with NGS  and Bioinformatics experience was recruited in May of 2013. The Facility has received external validation as  an Ion AmpliSeq Exome Certified Service Provider by Life Technologies. The Core works closely with the  Bioinformatics Shared Resource to assist users with additional downstream analysis, or custom applications of  NGS technology. The Microarray Q-PCR service continues to see significant demand, performing 800 Illumina  arrays quantitating gene expression and 8000 full service Q-PCR reactions in the past year. The Facility uses  the Illumina bead-based microarray system and provides full service array analysis, taking in RNA samples  from investigators, performing QC, and then performing array analysis through to initial data analysis using the  Illumina GenomeStudio software. Global gene expression analysis is performed using the Illumina BeadStation  500X microarray system, utilizing the cost-effective Illumina HT 48K human gene arrays, or for mouse gene  expression analysis, either 8x1 24K or 6x2 48K arrays. For QPCR services, the Facility has a dedicated Roche  LC480 (96 and 384 well blocks) and a Stratagene MP3000 96 well real-time PCR instruments. The Core also  assists users of the NanoString nCounter for amplification-free RNA Analysis, as well as support for a variety  of shared-use analytical instruments. Overall, the Genomics Shared Resource continues to provide broad  support to the Cancer Center, with its services utilized in the past funding period by 45 Cancer Center  laboratories representing all 3 programs, and has contributed to over 88 cancer-related publications."
"9279863","One mechanism used by prostate cancers to escape androgen deprivation and become castrate resistant  prostate cancer (CRPC) is generation of splice variant(s) (ARsv) of the androgen receptor (AR) that no  longer contain the C-terminal ligand-binding domain and are constitutively active. We have shown that these  forms occur not simply because of castration, but also require a decrease in intratumoral androgen levels.  Additionally, we have shown in preclinical studies that the newer androgen targeting agents such as  abiraterone and MDV3100 are potent agents in generating ARsvs. Moreover, these constitutively active  ARsvs generate a mitotic transcriptome that Is significantly altered from the canonical AR-ligand-driven  transcriptome. Clinically, the appearance of the ARsvs has been associated with more rapid progression  and time to death. However, the ARsv usually is co-expressed with the full-length AR (ARfl), raising the  question as to whether ARfl is required for ARsv activity. It has also not been shown how the ARSV  transcriptome is generated, i.e. do the ARsvs interact at different sites on chromatin the ARfl? A third issue is  whether generation of ARsvs is a transcriptional event due to intragenic rearrangement of the AR gene or  whether the variants can also be generated by post-transcriptional splicing mechanisms. Finally, clinical  studies have not been performed that identify the clinical spectrum of ARsv presentation. These questions  are important to address in order to develop appropriate therapy for the patients that invariably will relapse  on even the newest prostate cancer treatments directed at AR inhibition. In this project we will address these  questions by addressing the following Hypothesis and performing four specific aims: Hypothesis:  Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (ARsv) are generated by alternative splicing of AR  pre-mRNA in response to decreased intra-tumoral androgen levels as cell stress in induced; these variants  maintain AR-driven tumor progression, however, the effect of the AR variant may differ depending on variant  structure and whether the variant is acting independently or through dimerization with ARfi. Ultimately, the  expression of ARsv will determine development of CRPC and the response to therapy."
"9187530","Summary - Computational Core  The proposed computational core will provide theory and modeling hands-on expertise to all of the projects in  the Center. At any time, there will be at least one postdoc or graduate student of the Core actively interfacing  with each project. Regular monthly meetings between project PIs and the modeling core will help to clarify the  experimental and modeling objectives of each project for enhanced integration. Significance of experimental  and modeling results will be discussed at these meetings, and future experiments and modeling work will be  planned. The computational core will also actively develop user-friendly software packages for assisting data  collection, as well as Matlab routines and software for running simulations by non-experts. Tutorials on  modeling concepts, modeling results, and developed software will be conducted at center-wide retreats as well  as center symposia twice a year. All of the developed software packages will be made available to researchers  in the Center as well as the larger community. The aims of the computational aims are: (1) Develop a 3D  computational framework for simulating single-cell migration simultaneously with reaction-diffusion-advection  equations for complex biochemical signaling pathways. (2) Construct a computational platform for simulating  discrete numbers of interacting motile cells. Incorporate key physical parameters as well as coarse-grained  modeling of biochemical signaling pathways. (3) Bridge from discrete models of single cells to 3D continuum  algorithms for simulating the migration of multicellular groups."
"9187532","The majority of cancer mortality arises because tumors cells leave their primary site, giving rise to metastatic  tumors in other organs. While there are many and complex biologic aspects of tumor progression leading to  cancer metastasis, local invasion through the basement membrane of epithelia and migration of primary tumor  cells through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to access lymphatic and vascular channels is clearly a critical early  step. Tumor cells can invade and migrate individually or as groups. Accumulating pathologic and in vivo  experimental evidence now indicates that the most common form of tumor cell migration is likely as a collective  group. While we have learned a great deal about the cell biologic, biochemical, and biophysical mechanisms  underlying the migration of individual cells in 2D, 3D and in vivo, our understanding about the regulation of  collective cell migration in cancer metastasis is at an early stage. Organization of cells into collective groups  and their migration of cells is governed by a number of forces: passive (elastic and adhesive forces), frictional  (resistance to cells sliding past one another and cells sliding across a substrate), active (protrusive and  contractile forces), and traction forces upon the underlying or surrounding ECM. Which forces are critical for  the collective migration of tumor cells, and how, is not understood. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal  is that cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions will combine through adhesion crosstalk to modulate tumor collective  cell migration by altering cooperativity of motion and force generation. To test this hypothesis we have  developed computational tools and 2D and in vivo 3D experimental models that measure various physical  forces within and around a group of tumor cells as they organize to migrate in a collective through the tumor  stroma and within the tumor epithelium. Our approach to the problem is iterative: using computational  simulations to inform experimental testing of how various forces contribute to the organization and motion of  collective groups of tumor cells. We propose four specific aims using these tools to address this problem: Aim  1. To determine an integrated experimental and computational model of how tumor cell-intrinsic changes in  adhesion influence collective migration. Aim 2. To determine how changes in the tumor environment affect  collective migration of tumor cell. Aim 3. To determine how cell-cell and cell-ECM forces influence the nature  of tumor cell collective migration in clinically relevant primary human breast tumor samples. Aim 4. To develop  a computational model of collective cell migration dynamics in tissues."

"8997375","Project-4: (Columbia University and MSK)  Role of Acetyltransferase Gene Inactivation In DLBCL  Riccardo Dalla-Favera/Basic and Andrew Zelenetz/Clinical  PROJECT SUMMARY  Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common form of B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  (B-NHL), accounting for ~30% of de-novo diagnoses and also arising as a frequent clinical evolution of  Follicular Lymphoma (FL). Despite remarkable progress in the treatment of this disease, a significant fraction  of DLBCL remains incurable, underscoring the need to identify molecular mechanisms that are responsible for  disease development and that can be targeted therapeutically. By integrating whole exome sequencing and  high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, we have identified recurrent inactivating  mutations and deletions of CREBBP (CBP) and, more rarely, EP300 (p300) in a large fraction of DLBCL  patients, including 40% of those diagnosed de novo and ~50% of those derived from transformation of FL  (Pasqualucci et al., Nature 2011; Pasqualucci et al., Cell Reports 2014). CBP and p300 are two highly related  histone and non-histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and are involved in multiple signaling pathways by  modulating the activity of several proteins, such as the oncoprotein BCL6, which is typically inactivated by  acetylation, and the tumor suppressor p53, which instead requires acetylation for its function. Defects in CBP  and p300 may therefore play a central role in promoting the development and maintenance of lymphoma cells.  Following on these findings, the general objective of this proposal is to elucidate the normal and pathologic role  of CBP and p300 in B cells, to establish pre-clinical models for their therapeutic targeting, and to test the  activity of the novel HDAC inhibitor Mocetinostat in a phase II clinical trial. The following Specific Aims will be  pursued: 1). Identify the full complement of genetic and epigenetic lesions affecting CBP/p300 in DLBCL, as a  pre-requisite to design an optimal stratification strategy for the clinical trials proposed in Specific Aim 4. 2).  Identify biomarkers of CBP/p300 activity (and loss thereof) by defining the set of genes that are bound by CBP  and whose expression is modulated by CBP/p300 inactivation in GC B cells. 3). Elucidate the role of CBP  inactivation in normal B cell development and transformation, by constructing mutant mice in which CBP is  conditionally inactivated in GC B cells and which could be used as preclinical models for therapeutic testing. 4).  Investigate whether pharmacologic inhibition of specific deacetylases in DLBCL patients with CBP/p300  inactivation predicts improved clinical efficacy of deacetylase inhibitors, either alone or in combination with  other drugs."
"9093727","Current therapies for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are  unsatisfactory, During the past year, we and three other groups discovered that U2AF1 and seven other  components of the pre-mRNA splicing complex are recurrently mutated in patients with MDS and AML.  Small molecule modulators of this complex have,been developed by our collaborators and others. The most  advanced compounds in this class (called sudemycins) are soluble, stable, active against tumor xenografts  in mice, non-toxic to normal cells, and can be synthesized in gram quantities. Sudemycins bind the SF3b  splicing complex and induce apoptosis in cell lines after brief exposure, in part by causing alternative splicing  of MDM2, a negative regulator of P53. The long-term goal of this proiect is to develop RNA splicing  modulators as targeted therapv for MDS and AML, Our preliminary data demonstrate enhanced sensitivity  of cells expressing mutant U2AF1 to sudemycin. We hypothesize that mutations in RNA splicing machinery  confer sensitivity to splicing modulators by dysreguiating expression of alternatively spliced products that  contribute to MDS/AML pathogenesis. We will test this hypothesis using well-defined systems in vitro and in  vivo. In Specific Aim 1, primary human AML myeloblasts with or without splicing gene mutations, based on  completed sequencing of all coding genes in these samples, will be used to assess the impact of  sudemycins (and other splicing modulators) on growth, viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle kinetics in vitro and  chimerism, apoptosis, and trilineage differentiation in vivo after xenotransplantation into immune deficient  mice. This will determine whether splicing gene mutations serve as biomarkers of sensitivity to these drugs.  In Specific Aim 2, we will discover alterations in the transcriptome induced by splicing modulators and  develop sensitive and quantitative assays for assessment of the on-target effects of these agents. This  project addresses SPORE translational endpoints by identifying genetic biomarkers that are predictive of  response to splicing modulators and by developing assays that will be used for pharmacodynamic  monitoring in clinical trials of splicing modulators:  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Current chemotherapy treatments cure a minority of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and  acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We and others have recently discovered that RNA splicing, a critical  metabolic pathway, is altered in many of these patients and compounds that modulate this pathway are  available. This project will test the activity of this novel class of compounds in human cells and develop  assays and preclinical data needed to initiate clinical trials of these agents in patients with MDS or AML."
"9149756","5.2 Abstract - CELL IMAGING AND HISTOLOGY (Core Group A)  The Cell Imaging & Histology Shared Resource (Core Group A) provides Cancer Center researchers with  modern imaging tools and histology services, facilitates microscope-acquired data documentation and  analysis, and enables small and large volume electronic data sharing and storage. The Core supports studies  of pathological and molecular changes in human cancers as well as in experimental animal and cell culture  models that require histological examinations and probing of molecular changes in tissues and cells through  advanced imaging techniques. The Cell Imaging Facility provides state-of-the-art microscopy resources. Data  acquired using three confocal and six additional microscopes, supported 130 publications during the past grant  cycle. In the past year, the imaging capabilities of the Facility were utilized by 26 Cancer Center laboratories.  Expanded imaging capabilities, added through acquisition of a Zeiss LSM710 NLO multi-photon Laser  Scanning Microscope in 2011, permits deep laser scanning confocal microscopy, and extended live cell  imaging. High-resolution imaging and confocal microscopy, in combination with other imaging techniques,  including FRET, TIRF and time-lapse imaging, permit a spectrum of applications, including studies of cancer  cells motility, proliferation, and differentiation, protein localization and dynamic molecular interactions in cells,  time-lapse visualization of three-dimensional cancer cell accumulation, and studies of cellular responses to  drugs. Facility personnel maintain the microscopes, train investigators in optimal microscopy and imaging  techniques, and in advanced image analysis. Full-service imaging is also available. The Histology Core  supports histological and immunohistochemical analysis of cancer tissues, performs tissue preparation, fixation  and processing, paraffin- and cryosectioning, and histological and immunological stains to monitor  morphological and molecular alterations in cancer tissues. Last year, the Facility produced over 20,000 slides  for 25 Cancer Center laboratories, and processed over 5,000 for histology or immunological stains. The Facility  is taking a central role in archiving and sharing microscope-acquired data by scanning slides into the Aperio  XT- and -FL scanners, and supports automated data analysis and quantitation. The availability of easily shared  high-resolution scans of histological samples aids in utilizing an extended network of specialized consulting  pathologists who assist the Cancer Center. The core's web site provides contact information for a number of  pathologists, and the Facility Manager assists in matching a project with specific expertise. The Histology  Facility, which supported over 125 publications in the previous granting period, is currently launching a service  to assist investigators in obtaining human tissues. Addition of a Tissue Procurement Specialist will help  investigators locate sources for tumor tissues, facilitate inter-institutional agreements and IRB approvals,  coordinating and managing the entire procurement process. Centralized and expert assistance with tissue  procurement will greatly enhance the efficiency of connecting basic research with early translational studies."
"9340311","Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is an increasingly effective treatment for patients with hematological malignancies for whom suitable HLA-matched donors are not available. If T cells that mediate graft verus leukemia (GVL) could be distinguished from those that mediate graft versus host disease (GVHD), more effective immunotherapy strategies could be developed. Our long-term goal is to improve the outcome of CBT for patients with AML by engineering donor T cells to increase GVL without increasing GVHD. We hypothesize that donor T-cells targeting leukemia-associated antigens (LAA), such as the HLA-A2-restricted PR1 peptide on AML, preferentially mediate GVL activity over GVHD and that cord blood (CB) donor-derived PR1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (PR1-CTL) can be elicited and expanded ex vivo for clinical use to selectively induce GVL in CBT recipients. Thus, we have cloned high- and low-affinity PR1-specific T cell receptor-alphaBeta (TCR) heterodimers from PR1 vaccine clinical responders, which can be transduced into polyclonal T-cells to redirect antigen specificity and mediate antileukemic effects. We have also produced a monoclonal antibody with high affinity for a specific conformational epitope of PR1/HLA-A2 (8F4) that mediates potent and specific cytotoxicity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and a single chain Fv of 8F4 fused with CD3zeta + CD28 as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) will be used to gene modify T-cells to study GVL effects. In addition, the number of precursor PR1-CTL is ~1000-fold higher in CB compared to adult peripheral blood and CB PRI-CTL can be activated and expanded more than 5-fold in vitro. On the strength of these advances, we propose to (1) identify an optimal method to elicit and expand potent CB-derived PR1-CTL ex vivo by comparing (a) cell expansion from single CB units, (b) cell purification from multiple donors, (c) PR1-TCR-alphaBeta gene modification, and (d) 8F4-CAR gene modification; (2) use a xenogeneic mouse model to validate the potency of PR1-CTL against human AML in vivo to study the persistence and possible tolerance induction of PR1-CTL by AML, and to determine the spatial and temporal GVL effects, persistence, and possible tolerance of CB-derived PR1-CTL using bioluminescence and PET/CT imaging. Finally, based on the method identified to optimally obtain PR1-CTL, we will (3) test the clinical feasibility and safety of CB-derived PR1-CTL as adoptive cell therapy for AML patients after CBT."
"9211896","PROJECT SUMMARY  African American (AA) men have a higher rate of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) than  other men. However, the genetics contributing to this disparity remain elusive. Our preliminary data show that  CD24 is not expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells but is overexpressed in high-stage PC and  metastases, especially in AA men. In particular, highly expressed alleles of CD24 genetic variants are more  frequently present in AA men than in other groups. Thus, CD24 appears to contribute to metastatic CRPC in  AAs. The oncogenic function of CD24 has been demonstrated by ectopic and/or inducible expression,  targeted mutations, gene silencing, and antibody blockade. Notably, we developed a new concept of CD24-  dependent inactivation of mutant p53 in PC cells. Since mutant p53 is frequently associated with metastatic  CRPC, we hypothesize that CD24 promotes mutant p53 inactivation that contributes to tumor metastasis in  AA CRPC patients, which will be tested in two specific aims. Aim I will determine the effect of CD24-  dependent inactivation of mutant p53 on tumor metastasis in CRPC cells. Aim II will characterize the  association between CD24, mutant p53, and tumor metastasis in AA CRPC patients. Our proposed work will  provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the aggressive pathogenesis of PCs in AA  men and can be used to benefit AA men at risk of developing aggressive CRPCs."

"9107345","DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS  ABSTRACT  In the current grant period, CCSG Developmental Funds have been used in combination with philanthropic  funds to promote the strategic priorities of the UNM Cancer Center by supporting pilot projects. The UNMCC  pilot grant program was designed to; enhance collaborative multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary cancer  research; promote the use of Cancer Center Shared Resources to generate preliminary data for extramural grant  applications; support early phase, investigator-initiated clinical trials; provide matching support for graduate  students and postdoctoral fellows. All UNMCC members at New Mexico Universities, as well as at our consortium  partners (Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National  Laboratory) were eligible to apply. All funding decisions were made by the CCSG senior leadership after a formal,  rigorous peer review process organized by Dr. Tomkinson, Associate Director for Basic Research, with support  from the Cancer Center Research Administration. Outcomes (publications, grants, patents, clinical trials) from  the pilot grants are tracked by requesting annual progress reports for 5 years after the award has terminated.  Since 2010, 40 pilot grants involving more than 50 UNMCC members have been awarded. This investment of  $500,441 from CCSG Developmental funds and $200,388 from Cancer Center philanthropic funds resulted in  twenty seven publications in peer-reviewed journals and the award of one NCI K22 grant to a postdoctoral fellow,  six NIH R01 grants (including two multi-PI R01s), three NIH R21 grants and three grants from other national  funding agencies (including a Department of Defense-funded early phase investigator-initiated clinical trial), a  return of $8,848,872 million in direct costs ($13,013,384 total costs). In addition, funds from regional and national  foundations national foundations including Cowboy's for Cancer Research, Gabrielle's Angel Foundation, and  Oxnard Foundation and, more recently, Phi Beta Psi Charity Trust, and the Gillson-Longenbaugh and Anderson  Foundations have been used primarily to support collaborative translational and clinically focused research  projects.

The earlier cancer is detected, the more effective the treatment. That's why it's the mission of the Early Detection Research Network to research biomarkers. Biomarkers are indicators of disease or the potential for disease. Managing the enormous amount of knowledge, information, and data that goes into biomarker research requires a herculean effort. That's why EDRN turned to Jet Propulsion Laboratory to become EDRN's Informatics Center. JPL and NCI have worked together to build a leading edge, national, bioinformatics network for the capture, management, distribution and analysis of cancer research data. This network is based on leveraging the technologies, capabilities, and expertise of JPL in building scientific data-intensive systems across multiple disciplines. This includes the use of Apache OODT, originally developed by JPL, and now part of the Apache Software Foundation. OODT provides an open source, data management framework for building the EDRN Knowledge System or EKE. EKE is a virtual knowledge-base of biomarkers, studies, publications, and resulting science data from EDRN research that is integrated and powered by a semantic-based search. While the system appears fully integrated, it is really a virtual data system with data distributed at a national level. The infrastructure developed by the EDRN Informatics Center (IC) will not only support EDRN over the next five years but is well positioned to support other programs currently being developed under the leadership of the Cancer Biomarkers Research Group (CBRG). One such program is the Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions (MCL) consortium.  The MCL is a Consortium that consists of independent, multi-disciplinary teams to conduct comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of tumor tissue, cell, and microenvironment components to distinguish indolent from aggressive cancer among screen-detected early lesions, as well as between screen-detected from interval and symptom-detected cancers."

This will be accomplished through the following specific  aims: (1) To develop and implement an integrated cancer research education program that links  underrepresented undergraduate and graduate/medical students with post-doctoral fellows, medical residents,  junior faculty investigators, and senior level researchers through four integrated programs: (a) the Cancer  Research Immersion Student Program (CRISP) for undergraduate students; (b) the Summer Cancer Research  Education Program (SCREP) and Cancer Research Certificate Program (CRCP) for graduate and medical  students; (c) the Health Disparities Research Education Program (HDREP) for postdoctoral fellows and  medical residents as well as integration of undergraduate/graduate/medical students, postdoctoral fellows, and  junior faculty into multidisciplinary research teams; and (d) the Transitional Pathway Program (TPP) that will  facilitate the movement of undergraduate to graduate students, graduate/medical students to residents,  postdoctoral fellows and/or junior faculty, and junior faculty to established researchers in cancer disparities. (2)  To link cancer research scholars (undergraduate and graduate/medical students, medical residents, post-  doctoral fellows, and junior faculty) with the Outreach Core to share their research findings with community  members and obtain community feedback (e.g., Cancer Info Cafs) and to develop publications and  communications for lay audiences (e.g., blogs or posts on social media, YouTube videos, policy briefs); and (3)  To implement a mixed-method, triangulated evaluation of CRISP, SCREP, CRCP, HDREP, and TPP."
"9366352","The  purpose of this Inter-Agency Agreement is to investigate the importance of gut microbiota in providing isothiocyanates from cooked broccoli, a popular Brassica vegetable.  As the appreciation for the importance of gut microbiota increases, new questions emerge regarding whether gut microbiota can replace the need for dietary myrosinase (which is destroyed in cooking) to be consumed with cooked Brassica vegetables.  This Inter-Agency Agreement will provide the means to conduct a human feeding study to investigate the extent of microbial conversion of glucosinolates to isothiocyanates with and without repeated Brassica intake. The focus will be broccoli initially, since broccoli is a particularly well-consumed Brassica vegetable. This study will have added value as an extension of a previous collaborative broccoli adaptation study in which a dietary source of myrosinase was provided with the cooked broccoli. For this study, no dietary myrosinase will be provided, thus isolating the gut microbial conversion of glucosinolate glucoraphanin to isothiocyanate sulphoraphane. Blood and urine will be analyzed for isothiocyanates.  Fecal samples will be analyzed for microbiota composition."
"9108276","The Stem Cells, Differentiation and Cancer Program evolved from the former Cell Growth and Differentiation  Control Program with the inclusion of scientists from the former Immuno-oncology program that study B cell biology  and lymphoid malignancies. The program was further strengthened by the formation of a Stem Cell Institute at  Einstein with the recruitment of four cancer stem cell investigators. There are three major research themes that  partially overlap: the myeloid leukemias, lymphoid malignancies and stem cell biology, with a continued emphasis  on regulation at the transcriptional level. While there is a focus on hematological malignancies, the stem cell  research extends to hepatic, neural, and mammary stem cells. Dr. E. Richard Stanley is leader of this newly  configured program. The appointment of Dr. Amit Verma, physician scientist, as Co-Program leader and the  establishment of a Hematological Malignancies Working Group has catalyzed translation and increased the  number of correlative and therapeutic clinical studies. The goals of this program are: (i) to understand the  molecular events that occur during the normal differentiation of stem cell progenitors into their mature counterparts;  (ii) to identify the aberrations that occur in transcriptional programming that result in the malignant phenotype with a  special, but not sole, focus on the hematopoietic malignancies; (iii) to identify molecules that are novel therapeutic  targets, indicators of aggressiveness of disease or reporters of response to treatment; (iv) to translate laboratory  research findings into correlative and, ultimately, therapeutic trials and to enhance the effectiveness of clinical  regimens with existing and new chemotherapeutics and biologicals; and (v) to encourage those Program members  who share a common interest in stem cells, cellular programming, and their relationship to cancer to collaborate  with each other and with the members of other programs. Human tissue research has been facilitated by the  acquisition of two FACS Sorter Biosafety systems dedicated to this program, a Human Pluripotent Stem Cell  Center for the development and analysis of human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells that comprises a  stem cell preparation unit, a cell sorting and xenotransplantation unit, and a stem cell bioinformatics unit. There are  currently 31 program members of whom 30 are primary; nine are new recruits to Einstein. Research is supported  by 12 NCI grants ($2.66M DC) and 28 other cancer-relevant peer reviewed grants ($5.35M DC). Since 2008, there  have been 364 cancer-relevant publications by members of this program, of which 16% represent intra- and 17%  represent inter-programmatic collaborations."
"9132695","Ewing sarcoma family tumors (EFT) are highly malignant bone and soft tissue tumors that primarily affect  children, adolescents and young adults. Despite aggressive local control measures and systemic  chemotherapy, over a quarter of patients with localized tumors and nearly all patients with metastatic  disease will relapse at distant sites following initial clinical remission. Unfortunately, the outlook for these  patients is dismal and novel approaches to therapy are desperately needed. One ofthe biggest impediments  to improving outcomes and quality of life for patients with EFT is our inability to predict who is at risk for  metastatic relapse and to effectively identify and target the mechanisms that underlie this process. The  studies outlined in this proposal aim to address these critical gaps in our knowledge.    It is our overall goal to improve outcomes for patients with EFT by preventing metastatic relapse. In an effort  to achieve this goal we will address three specific aims. First, we will use studies of cell lines to evaluate the  role of CXCR4 positive EFT cells in mediating EFT metastasis. We will also determine if invasion  downstream of CXCR4 is mediated by and dependent on RhoA. Second, we will test small molecule  inhibitors of the RhoA/MKL transcriptional axis in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo to evaluate their efficacy as novel  agents forthe prevention of EFT metastasis. Third, we will use retrospectively and prospectively collected  EFT samples to validate whether expression of G-protein coupled receptors can be used to predict high-risk  disease in newly diagnosed patients. Demonstration that CXCR4, CXCR7 and/or LGR5 expression can be  used to identify patients at high risk of metastatic relapse will allow classification of patients into clinical risk  categories. In turn, this will allow for treatment stratification and identification of patients who should be  included in future trials that are designed to prevent relapse in high-risk patients."
"9143724","The principal goal of the Developmental Research Program is to fund promising early stage projects that  address important translational objectives in prevention, early detection, and therapy of pancreatic  carcinoma. Our principal intent for Developmental Research Program is to bring novel translational research  projects to the SPORE program. Key elements that determine priority in this program are innovation,  novelty, and potential for success in translational pancreatic cancer research. All Developmental Funds will  be awarded by competition based on submission of a NIH-style pilot project application. There is a  requirement for clear evidence that the proposed project shows potential of developing into a larger research  project that will involve human intervention for pancreatic cancer (diagnostic or therapeutic). We will have  available a minimum of $350,000 a year ($50,000 from the SPORE grant, $200,000 and a year in matching  funds from office of the vice chancellor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and $100,000 a year in  funds from the UNMC Eppley Cancer Center), which will be used to fund from 4-7 projects depending on the  nature of the project and the budget. We will accept applications from single investigators for focused  projects with budgets of up to $50,000 or larger collaborative projects involving two or more investigators  with budgets of up to $100,000.Once a year, a request for proposals (RFP) is developed by the Principal  Investigator and distributed to all faculty at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Creighton University,  the University of Nebraska at Omaha, the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, University of Nebraska at  Kearny, collaborating faculty at other institutions, and faculty members at other Institutions who have  contacted us or have been identified by the SPORE Scientific Council, Internal Advisory Board, or External  Advisory Committee as potential collaborators on existing projects or developers of important new SPORE  projects related to pancreatic cancer. The projects must be translational in nature, and therefore must  undertake a basic research project that has the potential of developing a human intervention within the next  7 years or a basic science investigation of a clinical observation or problem."
"9132694","The lack of effective systemic therapies is the major unresolved clinical problem in genetically complex soft  tissue sarcoma (STSs). While clinically and biologically diverse, collectively this STS subset is typified by  aggressive behavior, a high rate of recurrence and metastatic spread, and resistance to chemotherapy,  resulting in a dismal prognosis. Overall survival has stagnated at the 5 year 50% level for decades and  inoperable STSs are universally fatal. Considering the molecular heterogeneity and regulatory intricacy of  these STSs, treatment strategies that target common unifying cellular deregulatory processes are a logical  approach. Preclinical studies suggest a promising therapeutic role for broad spectrum histone deacetylase  inhibitors (HDACIs) against multiple STS histologies. Importantly, HDACis were found to sensitize STS  cells to clinically utilized conventional chemotherapies (e.g. doxorubicin) in vitro and in vivo. The current  application aims to translate these findings into the clinic through a phase-ll clinical trial testing a  combination of HDACi and chemotherapy in patients with advanced STS; molecular correlates predicting  response/resistance to this novel therapeutic approach will be elucidated. Specifically, metastatic  leiomyosarcoma (LMS) patients, a relatively homogenous cohort representative of genetically complex  STS will be included in this 'proof of principle' study which will be enabled by the multi-institutional SARC  sponsorship of this application. In addition, investigations will focus on evaluating the role of HDACiinduced  autophagy in therapeutic response. Preliminary studies suggest that this process confirms  therapeutic tolerance in STS; if so, autophagy blockade might further enhance HDACI effects. Finally, it is  pertinent that HDACs are a family of proteins; most of the HDACis currently in clinical testing block multiple  HDAC isoforms. Despite their promise, improvement in the therapeutic index of these drugs is needed  given their potential toxicities. One such augmentation may derive from targeting a single HDAC isoform.  Buttressed by exciting initial data, studies proposed here target one poorly characterized HDAC isoform,  HDACS; investigational HDACS-specific inhibitors are currently available. Taken together, the overarching  long term goal of the proposed studies is to advance STS therapy and improve patients' outcome. Building  on substantial preliminary insights and the availability of unique STS models and bioresources, a  translationally relevant plan has been devised combining 'low' and 'high' throughput experimentation.  Three Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate the activity of an HDACi/doxorubicin combination in patients  with metastatic LMS; 2) Examine the role of autophagy as a novel process contributing to HDACi  tolerance: 3) Determine the impact of HDACS blockade on STS growth in vitro and in vivo."
"9107360","TRANSLATIONAL CANCER BIOLOGY AND SIGNALING (TCBS) RESEARCH PROGRAM  ABSTRACT  The Translational Cancer Biology and Signaling (TCBS) Research Program at the University of New Mexico  Cancer Center (UNMCC), led by Bridget Wilson, PhD and Eric Prossnitz, PhD, unites an outstanding team of  30 (25 full and 5 associate members) basic, translational, and clinical scientists from 3 University of New  Mexico Schools and Colleges (School of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, College of Arts & Sciences) in 10  academic departments and from New Mexico?s two Department of Energy National Laboratories (Los Alamos  and Sandia National Laboratories). Program science is centered on mechanistic, translational, and clinical  studies of cancer biology, focused on imaging and modeling signal transduction pathways critical for cancer  etiology and progression in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. State-of-the-art methods are used to  study the fundamental biology and function of established and novel cancer targets in cell signaling pathways,  enhanced through collaborative interactions among many program members. The program?s goals are to  accelerate the translation of our science to the design and conduct of investigator-initiated institutional and NCI  NCTN-sponsored clinical trials as well as the design and conduct of embedded correlative science studies.  The Specific Aims of the TCBS Program are to: 1) characterize, image, and model cell signaling pathways in  normal and cancer cells, particularly focusing on normal and mutated cell surface receptors and their closely  coupled signaling partners as well as intracellular trafficking and organelle-specific contributions to  carcinogenesis; 2) investigate the contributions of cell-cell interactions and the microenvironment in cancer  initiation, progression and metastasis; 3) define the roles of the immune response and linked inflammatory  processes in both solid tumors and leukemia, with a focus on therapeutic antibody strategies; and 4) translate  our discoveries to the development of therapeutic interventions against cell signaling targets and pathways,  with integrated correlative science studies.  During the prior funding period (from 2010 to 9/1/2014) of the UNMCC NCI P30 CCSG, TCBS Program  members published 344 primary articles, book chapters and reviews including high impact journals such as the  Nature journals, Immunity, PNAS and BLOOD. Collaboration is extensive, with 21% overall intra-programmatic  publications (with annual percentages ranging from 17-28%). Almost a quarter of these publications were inter-  programmatic (overall, 25%; range 17%-26%). In 2014, year to date, intra-programmatic publications are 28%  while inter-programmatic publications are 21%. Funding to the TCBS Program (as of 9/1/14) is $9,159,653 in  annual direct costs, of which $8,619,713 is peer-reviewed direct funding and $1,839,073 (20%) is from the  NCI. A current portfolio of 30 clinical trials is led by clinician scientists in the Program, of which three are early  phase investigator-initiated trials derived from Program science."
"9099783","Epigenetie alterations have been hypothesized to play important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression, including the development of CRPC. Work from several groups including our own demonstrates a continued critical role for the androgen receptor (AR) in CRPC. In addition, recent work from our lab defining the AR cistromes in a model of androgen-dependent prostate cancer and CRPC has shown that AR is recruited to distinct genomic sites in CRPC where it executes a distinct transcriptional program. These CRPC selective AR binding sites harbor epigenetie chromatin marks characteristic of active transcriptional enhancers and regulate a set of cell cycle regulatory genes including CDK1, CCNB1, CDC20 and UBE2C that are required for CRPC growth. These same genes are over-expressed in authentic cases of CRPC.  EZH2, a SET domain histone methyltransferase known to play a role in gene silencing through H3K27 methylation is up-regulated in CRPC. In preliminary studies we have found that EZH2 can be recruited to the cis-regulatory elements of CRPC selective AR target genes such as CDK1 and UBE2C, forming a complex with AR in prostate cancer cells. Surprisingly, EZH2 directly up-regulates these AR targets in CRPC cells but not in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. In addition EZH2 is required for the growth of CRPC cells.  Thus the overall hypothesis that will be tested in this study is that the epigenetie regulator EZH2 reprograms AR function in CRPC to stimulate the induction of a set of cell cycle regulatory genes required for the AR dependent growth of CRPC. |n Aim 1 we will analyze EZH2-dependent gene expression profiles and cistromes in CRPC cells; in Aim 2 we will determine the mechanisms underlying the interaction between AR and EZH2 in modulating the specific subset of genes up-regulated in CRPC by AR; and in Aim 3 we will utilize the Biospecimen and Animal Models Core to profile gene expression, epigenetie chromatin modifications, EZH2 and AR cistromes and DNAse I hypersensitivity in xenograft models of CRPC in order to validate the findings from cell culture."

The Resource,  directed by Bruce Edwards, PhD and managed by Mark Carter, MS, provides cell analysis, cell sorting, and  offline data analysis as standard services. Resource users are individually trained in instrument and software  use. Current charge back rates to Resource users are in the low to mid-range of rates nationwide. The Resource  also has a history of innovation: The Resource and members of the UNMCC Cancer Therapeutics (CT) Research  Program (Sklar & B. Edwards) invented the capability to conduct high throughput screens using a flow cytometric  platform (commercialized as HyperCyt in 2006), which led to creation of a full-fledged High Throughput  Screening Center: The UNM Center for Molecular Discovery (CMD), which is affiliated with the Resource. In the  past project period, the Resource has worked to facilitate access to CMD for UNMCC members as well as  collaborators at other NCI Cancer Centers and HyperCyt high throughput screening as a technical service,  allowing Resource users routine access to novel high throughput screening technologies. The Resource  supports small scale screening projects for investigators who have already developed targets that are ready for  screening in 96- or 384-well plates. The Resource also serves as a conduit for pilot projects funded from local  resources to evolve into larger, NIH-supported screening projects in the CMD. This highly productive strategy  has allowed UNMCC Program members to identify potent small molecule probes for estrogen receptors,  GTPases, formyl peptide receptors and efflux transporters, as well as a number of approved drugs that could be  repurposed for new clinical applications. The Resource also provides easily accessible reservation and billing  systems. To promote excellence in research, the Resource provides UNMCC Program members and trainees  with expert assistance and information to facilitate development of cell analysis and discovery projects in support  of grant applications and publications. A Resource priority is to integrate advanced technologies developed by  the CMD and UNMCC Research Programs into its operations to make them more broadly available to the  research community. Education and dissemination activities include: participation in production of a UNM Shared  Resource newsletter, workshops and presentations on specialized topics pertaining to flow cytometry and drug  discovery, ad hoc facility tours for students and faculty, and a Resource web page to advertise upcoming events  and Resource instruments, services and fees. During the previous 5-yr project period, 48 UNMCC members  from 4 UNMCC Research Programs used the Resource, resulting in a total of 97 publications, of which 15 are  presently pending PMCIDs.

"9001914","Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource  Project Summary/Abstract  The Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource (PMSR) consists of a Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research  Center (FHCRC)-based Proteomics/Metabolomics laboratory and a University of Washington-South Lake  Union (UW-SLU) laboratory. The Proteomics section of the PMSR was formed in November 2002 with the goal  of providing cost-effective high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry-based proteomics  services to Cancer Consortium (Consortium) members. The Proteomics resource's mission is to provide high  quality service in a timely manner for small- and large-scale qualitative and quantitative proteomics analyses,  protein modification characterization, and targeted proteomic analyses. These services have evolved from  small-scale identification of protein complexes in model systems and identifying modifications on highly purified  proteins to large-scale biomarker discovery/validation experiments in serum samples and phosphoproteomics  analysis of animal organs. The PMSR received an outstanding merit assessment in 2008.  In 2010, the PMSR was expanded to include metabolomics research and related resources through the joint  recruitment of Daniel Raftery, Ph.D., a recognized leader in metabolomics research, to FHCRC and the  University of Washington (UW). Along with the proteomics services mentioned above, the resource now  provides untargeted profiling of aqueous metabolites and lipids (lipidomics), targeted profiling of metabolites  from numerous metabolic pathways via mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  and isotope tracer capabilities. The PMSR is also rapidly developing mass spectrometry phospholipid  analysis. The resource is committed to developing and implementing new proteomics and metabolomics tools  in order to uncover the molecular details that influence cancer biology and to support development of  diagnostic and clinical tests.  Scientific operations of the Proteomics and Metabolomics resource are divided between FHCRC and UW-  medicine sites. Dr. Gafken oversees all operations at FHCRC and Dr. Raftery oversees those at UW. Drs.  Gafken and Raftery meet on a monthly to coordinate activities, or more frequently if needed for specific  projects. All proteomics-based projects are performed at FHCRC while metabolomics-based projects are  divided between the two sites. Metabolomics projects for which established, routine assays are available are  performed at FHCRC while those metabolomics projects that are non-routine and require significant  development are performed at UW. As new metabolomics assays are developed and refined at the UW site,  FHCRC-based staff will be trained on these protocols to make them more widely available as a service. All  NMR capabilities and NMR-related projects will be conducted at UW-SLU."

The revised name of this  Core (formerly ?Informatics and Data Management?) reflects a focus on biology-centered bioinformatics  services that evolved from routine gene/protein sequence and structure analyses to the advanced systems-  level support of modern biological research. The Core's mission is to assist investigators in transforming  diverse types of raw experimental data (e.g., reads, intensities, peptide counts, or mutation data) into biological  knowledge. It features Systems Biology analysis of high-throughput omics datasets to generate testable  hypotheses and improve understanding of complex biological processes. The Core also provides statistical  consulting and support for experimental design as well as data analysis. The Core assists other Shared  Resources with implementation and use of specialized bioinformatic tools and workflows, such as an animal  informatics system for Animal Resources and a data management system for Proteomics. The Core played  essential role in developing, launching and maintenance of new databases, web-sites, and computational  resources in collaboration with CC investigators. Major improvements over the last period include enhanced  expertise in statistical analysis, Next-Gen sequencing data analysis, data mining, and integrative pathway and  networks analysis. Assistance is provided with Next-Gen sequencing data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq,  DNA-seq, exome sequencing, targeted resequencing), microarray data analysis, pathway analysis, data  mining and data integration, statistical data analysis and experiment planning. Utilizing computational  resources (Linux clusters, desktop computers, and multiple Linux servers), proprietary and public software and  databases (e.g., IPA, MetaCore, NextBio, GeneSpring, TRANSFAC, R/Bioconductor, TCGA, CCLE,  GenePattern), the Core has contributed significantly to scientific objectives of the Center's research. Use of the  Core continues to grow, with 24 PIs representing all three CC programs supported during the last year. Data  analyses and computational support provided by the Core over the last year resulted in at least 25 publications  (including eight co-authored by the Core personnel), with the Core supporting at least 75 publications over the  last funding period. Training is an essential activity of the Core, which organized numerous bioinformatics and  statistics training classes, and provided more than a hundred personalized trainings and tutorials. The Core is  recognized nationally and internationally, with collaborative projects completed with Cancer Centers in US, as  well as in Australia and Spain. Anticipated future enhancements of the Core will include increased support of  translational research with large and mixed types of omics data, including biomarker discovery and drug target  prioritization. The importance of bioinformatic analysis in cancer research will continue to increase, and the  Core will evolve and grow to support such analysis, providing leadership in implementing new approaches."

Access to archived clinical hospital pathology FFPE tissues is  routed through the Resource to simplify clinical block and slide retrieval/return enabling quick delivery to UNMCC  investigators. Because the Resource is an ?honest broker? per the UNM Institutional Review Board (IRB),  samples may be de-identified or anonymized, thereby removing the requirement for IRB review. This option to  convert human samples to ?non-human subjects? research saves considerable time while optimally safeguarding  HIPAA identifiers. The Resource complies with the NCI Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources. Compliance  comprises rigorous quality control and quality assurance procedures, a formal tissue prioritization committee  review process for sample release, secure data management, and independent oversight of the repository. Since  the prior 2010 competitive NCI P30 CCSG renewal, the Resource has significantly surpassed its stated goal of  collecting 10,000 frozen and FFPE research specimens and now holds >25,000 frozen biospecimens and >7,000  FFPE blocks, with a significant increase in its collection of breast, prostate, and other cancer specimens. The  Resource has substantially grown in staff, collections, capabilities, and facilities, with a move to a newly  renovated, larger laboratory and freezer rooms. Through a new agreement between UNM and New Mexico's  largest private hospital system, the Resource will have access to cancer samples from >70% of New Mexicans  and will substantially increase its banking activities, with access to an additional 1,000 cancer specimens  annually. Billing and usage data are electronic and centralized. During the previous 5-year project period, 36  UNMCC members from 4 UNMCC Research Programs used the Resource, resulting in a total of 21 publications,  of which 4 are presently pending PMCIDs. In the reporting year of July 2013 ? June 2014, UNMCC members  were responsible for 85% of total Resource usage and were supported by 106 peer-reviewed grants."
"9079370","The Biological Macromolecule Shared Resource (BMSR) represents a consolidation of services previously offered by the Molecular Biology and the Virus Vector shared resources, with the addition of a new service for recombinant protein production and purification. The overall goal of the BMSR is to facilitate and implement multiple end-points, both those within this shared resource, and those involving interfacing with other shared resources. These include the production of research grade virus particles, knock-in/knock-out mice (in collaboration with the Transgenic/Knockout Mouse Shared Resource), knock-in/knock-out somatic cell lines using homologous recombination, transient and stable protein expression in mammalian cells, recombinant protein production (bacterial, yeast, insect, and mammalian systems) and purification for structural analysis (in collaboration with the Structural Biology Shared Resource), and for protein interaction studies using the Biacore instrumentation located in the Flow Cytometry shared resource. In addition to moving vectors provided by investigators towards these end points, we offer design, construction and validation services for the generation of new vectors. The BMSR is co-directed by Dr Shirley Taylor (CMG), who brings molecular biology, cell culture, and protein expression experience, and Dr Darrell Peterson (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology) a protein biochemist with extensive experience in protein production and purification. The BMSR employs a Resource Manager (Ms Kimberly Stratton, MS) and two full time research specialists, each of whom takes primary responsibility for one of the three major areas, but with sufficient cross-training in ail services offered to ensure continuity and maximal efficiency.    The BMSR generally operates at >85% capacity, serving a wide range of investigators both within the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC), and from the VCU research community. For the period January 1 2008 through December 31, 2010, MCC members with peer-reviewed funding accounted for approximately 70% of basic services and special projects. In CY 2010 the virus vector services of the BMSR served five funded MCC investigators, and three non-MCC investigators. Since its inception in January 2010, the Protein Production facility has served five funded MCC investigators and two non-MCC investigators, on ten separate projects. The BMSR served 22 peer-reviewed funded MCC investigators in routine services and special projects and 15 non-MCC investigators."

"9211894","PROJECT SUMMARY  The involvement of skilled bioethicists is necessary for the success of research in the basic and translational  sciences. In particular, research that is conducted to reduce the burdens caused by the racial disparities in  cancer incidence requires bioethical guidance. For these reasons, the Bioethics Shared Resource (BESR) is  an integral component of this Partnership. For full/pilot projects, the BESR provides consultation and  collaborative support regarding ethical issues from design to implementation and assists in the development of  grant proposals, abstracts, and manuscripts. In addition to its work supporting the research of Partnership  investigators, the BESR enhances the bioethical capabilities of the Partnership participants. This is  accomplished by providing education in bioethics to investigators, junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, medical  residents, graduate/undergraduate and medical students, community health advisors, navigators, partners, and  other Partnership personnel regarding sound applications of bioethical principles in cancer research. The  BESR provides bioethical education through the Research Education Core of the Partnership and, at TU,  collaborates in teaching the graduate/undergraduate courses in bioethics in research, health disparities, and  health policy. Bioethics support is essential for enhancing of the basic and translational research of the  MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership."

"9340308","Umbilical cord blood (CB) can serve as an alternative graft for patients lacking a matched related donor, yet  intrinsically low cell doses leading to delayed engraftment and graft failure severely restrict wider use of this  valuable resource. Hence, the central hypothesis of Project 1 is that CB progenitors expanded ex vivo on  mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will provide more rapid hematopoietic reconstitution, as well as less  engraftment failure, than unmanipulated CB cells. Indeed, the CB mononuclear cell/MSC co-culture system  we have developed should avoid the significant CD34+ cell losses we experienced in earlier liquid  suspension culture studies and, because it provides a surrogate niche for the propagation of CB  progenitors, should yield improved CB cell expansion overall. This prediction will be tested in a phase 1  clinical trial in patients undergoing CB transplantation for hematologic malignancies (Aim 1.1), coupled with  mechanistic studies to determine if optimal expansion is inhibited by specific CB accessory cells in the  coculture system (Aim 1.2). Although a low cell dose is clearly the chief limitation of CB transplantation, a  number of investigators have reported a defect in the homing of CB cells to the bone marrow. Thus, even  with improved CB expansion. Inadequate homing may limit the rapidity of engraftment ~ the focus of this  research project. The homing defect has been attributed to low levels of fucosylation of cell surface  molecules responsible for binding to P- and/or E-selections, a key component of the mechanism by which  circulating blood progenitors are recruited to the marrow microvasculature. We hypothesize that increasing  the level of CB cell surface fucosylation will improve interactions with selectins, thereby improving homing  and then engraftment. Thus, to assess the modification of unmanipulated and expanded CB progenitors  with fucosyltransferase, as means to facilitate their recruitment to the marrow, we have planned both a  clinical trial (Aim 2) and mechanistic studies in mice (Aim 3) that will model the CB transplant setting.  Success in this project will help to circumvent two of the remaining barriers to effective CB transplantation,  thereby broadening the use of this procedure in patients who otherwise lack practical therapeutic options."

SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  All three Partnering institutions, Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the  UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC), have established Administrative Cores. As part of the  currently active U54, at each of the three institutions, an efficient administrative infrastructure is in place. The  primary objectives of this core are for coordination, communication, budgetary oversight, and clerical functions  associated with the overall research program proposed in this grant application. The Partnership has four  Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Planning & Evaluation, and Research Education), Research Projects (two  Full Projects and a Pilot Project), and two Shared Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). The  Partnership Administrative Core, which is responsible for administrative management of Partnership-wide  activities, is comprised of the institution-specific Executive Committees (ECs), the Partnership Leadership  Committee (PLC), the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The  ECs, consisting of all institution-specific Principal Investigators (PIs) (Lead, Co-PIs, and Co-Leaders of all  cores and shared resources) meet once a month and are responsible for the day-to-day oversight at each  institution. The PLC, consisting of the leaders and co-leaders of all three institutions, as in the past, will have a  monthly tele-conference and will be responsible for internal planning, execution, and assessment of the  Partnership activities. The IAC, consisting of six leaders (two from each Partnering institution), reviews, twice a  year, the Partnership?s progress and decisions and provides guidance to the overall Partnership. The PSC,  consisting of seven external members, whose expertise covers all areas of the proposed research programs,  and an NCI-official as an ex-officio member, functions as the external review body, which annually evaluates  all components of the Partnership?s progress and provides guidance. Further, a Scientific Review Committee,  consisting of all PIs and a science editor, solicits pilot projects that will be funded in years 4 and 5 of the  funding cycle, and assigns to external reviewers to assess their scientific merit and for funding after obtaining  approvals from PSC. The expertise of the PIs of all three institutions is complementary to each other, and most  of these leaders have been successfully working together for more than 10 years. The Program Managers,  together with Administrative/Finance Officers of the respective institutions, aid the Partnership by providing  day-to-day administrative support, coordination, preparation of the annual progress reports, and logistical  services needed to accomplish the Partnership functions.

"9187533","Project 3 Summary   Sarcoma is a malignant cancer derived from transformed cells of mesenchymal origin. Progression and  metastasis of sarcomas is regulated by microenvironmental cues. Low intratumoral O2 (hypoxia) most  dramatically increases pulmonary metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes, though we do not yet completely  understand the critical effects of hypoxia on sarcoma cells and the microenvironment. Thus, defining how primary  tumor cells respond to O2 in their microenvironment is essential for understanding metastasis and identification  of novel therapeutic targets.   Our recent work has shown that hypoxia promotes sarcoma metastasis, through induction of HIF1??PLOD2  and the subsequent deposition of aberrant collagen that leads to distant metastasis. However, we do not yet  know 1) how cell migration/invasion is altered in the presence of the O2 gradients that occur in tumors, 2) which  collagen modifying-enzymes define the ECM, and 3) precisely how cells? motility is modified in response to  altered collagen structure in the microenvironment. The proposed studies address each of these unknowns. To  model the O2-gradients that develop in tumors as they outgrow their vascular supply we developed novel O2-  controlling hydrogels that can serve as 3D hypoxic microenvironments.   We hypothesize that sarcoma cell invasion and migration is guided by increased O2 tension and facilitated  by hypoxia-induced ECM remodeling. We will determine if O2 gradients regulate the direction, speed and  distance of migrating sarcoma cells, how these factors depend on hypoxic ECM remodeling, focusing on collagen  microstructure. Our approach will integrate mathematical modeling and experimental in vitro and in vivo models,  linking O2-ECM-cellular invasion and migration in sarcomas. The specific aims are: (1) To determine sarcoma  cell and tumor graft responses to spatial oxygen gradients; (2) To characterize collagen remodeling during  sarcoma invasion under hypoxic gradients; (3) To determine how collagen fiber organization regulates hypoxic  invasion and migration. The results of the experiments proposed here will identify the molecular and physical  mechanisms underlying the initial steps of metastasis, invasion and migration, and develop predictive models  for these mechanism, all leading to novel therapeutic targets."

The Resource was established as a Developing  Resource in July 2006 with funds from the UNMCC and the NCI P30 Cancer Center Support Grant and has  evolved to offer a wide range of services, including consultation, protocol development and guidance through  the compliance process, animal housing (provided in collaboration through the Animal Resource Facility),  husbandry, handling, treatment, monitoring, surgery, and dissection/necropsy. The Resource has a  comprehensive range of state-of-the-art capabilities in small-animal imaging, including PET/SPECT/CT  modalities, MRI and other magnetic-based imaging modalities. The small-animal models component of the  Resource specializes in genetically modified, chemically induced, and xenograft models of cancer, including  orthotopic models and immunodeficient models for growth of primary human tumor tissues. The small-animal  imaging component of the Resource is involved in emerging PET/SPECT/CT and bioluminescence/ fluorescence  imaging and therapeutic research, and offers users a broad range of radiolabeling and in vivo analysis. In 2014,  UNMCC purchased a new bioluminescence/fluorescence imaging instrument to track tumor progression,  metastasis, and labeled nanotherapeutics and a new small animal irradiator, which will enhance development  and analysis of humanized mouse models and hematopoietic cell engraftment. In 2014, the Cancer Center also  recruited a dedicated Veterinary Pathologist to join the Resource to provide support to UNMCC investigators.  Two faculty co-Directors, Helen Hathaway, PhD and Jeffrey Norenberg, PhD, PharmD, direct the Resource and  services are provided by experienced technical staff. The Resource Directors are committed to continual  development of state-of-the-science techniques to enhance UNMCC Research Programs. The Resource  disseminates information about new technologies and models by maintaining an up-to-date web page, hosting  regular open houses, and by giving presentations at UNMCC meetings and retreats. Reservations, billing and  usage are tracked through a centralized on-line system. During the previous 5-year project period, 13 UNMCC  members from 3 UNMCC Research Programs used the Resource, resulting in a total of 27 publications, of which  5 are presently pending PMCIDs. In the reporting year of July 2013 ? June 2014, UNMCC members were  responsible for 83% of total Resource usage and were supported by 29 cancer-focused, peer-reviewed grants.  Utilization of the Resource is expected to grow significantly in the next project period with the recent recruitment  of many new UNMCC investigators developing and utilizing animal models in their research."
"9093729","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with  relapsed/refractory leukemia. The therapeutic benefits of allo-HSCT for hematologic malignancies are  primarily derived from a graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect that is mediated by mature donor T cells present in  the bone marrow graft. Unfortunately, the same donor T cells that mediate the beneficial GvL effect can also  cause graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), the major life-threatening complication of allo-HSCT. Managing the  threat of GvHD while maximizing the beneficial GvL effect would broaden the scope and usefulness of  allo-HSCT procedures, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory t cells (Tregs) have been shown to prevent GvHD in  preclinical studies by suppressing alloreactive donor T cells without sacrificing GvL, thereby providing a  promising treatment option. Unfortunately, several limitations have prevented the routine clinical use of Tregs:  1) the low circulating numbers of Tregs in peripheral blood, 2) loss of suppressor activity following in vitro  expansion and 3) the lack of Treg-specific surface markers necessary to purify in vitro expanded Tregs. We  previously reported that the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine (AzaC)-induced Foxp3 expression  and increased donor Tregs in vivo, thereby mitigating GvHD without abrogating GvL in a murine allo-HSCT  model. Surprisingly, we found that AzaC-mediated suppression of GvHD was independent of Foxp3, the  master regulator of Treg function. We identified three candidate genes that are highly upregulated by AzaC in  anti-CD3/CD28 bead- and APC-activated CD4+/CD25- T cells and which might be responsible for the  suppressor function of AzaC-induced Tregs based on genome-wide RNA profiling analyses. We hypothesize  that AzaC will induce similar immunomodulatory effects in human T cells. In this SPORE project we will  assess the safety and efficacy of AzaC in patients with AML and MDS undergoing allogeneic stem cell  transplant (Aim 1) and will perform mechanistic studies to determine how AzaC and other DNMT1 inhibitors  exert their immunomodulatory effects on GvHD and GvL in vitro and in vivo.

"9366326","Investigating the molecular basis of how epigenomic and genomic factors influence susceptibility to Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans using human NAFLD samples is desirable but frequently impractical. In contrast, using relevant animal models that resemble human NAFLD development may substantially overcome the many limitations of human-only studies and provide important clues regarding the molecular consequences of etiological factors linked to NAFLD susceptibility and severity. This Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) will investigate the extent of molecular changes indicative of NAFLD-associated liver injury to assist in identifying susceptible individuals. Thus, we hypothesize that (a) the status of individual epigenomic hepatic phenotypes is a fundamental factor that predetermines susceptibility to NAFLD; and (b) an evaluation of epigenomic hepatic phenotypes in a genetically heterogeneous mouse population will assist in identifying individuals susceptible to NAFLD. To test the hypothesis, we are using Collaborative Cross mice, a state-of-the-art mouse population model, to investigate the induction of NAFLD by a Western Diet.  Next generation sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with DNA microarray methodology (Chip-on-chip) and quantitative RT-PCR will be used to assess whole genome-scale epigenomic changes and expression of protein-coding and non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, in plasma, white blood cells, and livers."

A consensus was reached to reorganize the Program to address review concerns and  enhance collaborative interactions. The reorganized and refocused CIS Program required new faculty  recruitment to strengthen the reorganized Program and the mission of the Purdue University Center for Cancer  Research (PCCR). The reorganized CIS Program serves the PCCR as the central component for basic  discovery in cancer cell biology. To do this, CIS leverages Purdue University foundational strengths in the  biological sciences, medicinal chemistry, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, and nutrition science, to address  critical topics in cancer cell biology. Specifically, the overall mission of the CIS Program is to investigate key  molecules that impact signaling pathways and gene expression programs, and to understand how cellular  identity is determined or altered. CIS members are committed to understanding what is needed to maintain  cellular identity and correcting the identity crisis that cancer cells undergo. The CIS membership represents 7  different Purdue academic departments and 5 colleges, and has grown from 26 members to 33 members  through the addition of 14 new members since the previous CCSG review. The CIS Program has a current  portfolio of ~$4.3 million (direct costs) of NCI and other peer-reviewed, cancer-related support. As a result of  PCCR support and the programmatic changes initiated by the CIS Program Leaders, CIS collaborative  publications have dramatically increased with intra-programmatic publications at 8% (~38% increase) and  inter-programmatic at 25% (~68% increase); inter-institutional collaborations are at 17%, providing an overall  strong collaborative publication rate of ~43%. The CIS Program is structured to address the issue of cellular  identity by focusing on two major Research Clusters: Signaling and Cellular Growth Control and Regulation of  Gene Expression. CIS Program members also share the common goal of focusing on basic science to identify  and characterize key molecules for cellular processes that can be translated into cancer solutions. The  biological expertise and cancer targets that CIS members study allow them to develop collaborations within the  CIS Program and among members of the other PCCR Research Programs, adding considerable value to the  PCCR."
"9149760","5.6 Abstract - PROTEOMICS (Core Group B)  The Proteomics Shared Resource (Core Group B) offers a state-of-the-art infrastructure for protein analysis  from simple protein ID to global analysis, which is tailored to the specific needs of Cancer Center  investigators. The Core technologies include methods for upfront sample fractionation and back-end protein  identification by mass spectrometry (MS) and database searching. Core MS instruments include Thermo LTQ,  LTQ Orbitrap XL and LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro systems, and Bruker HCTUltra and MALDI Autoflex II TOF/TOF  systems. Routine services include protein/peptide molecular weight determination by MALDI-MS, identification  of gel separated proteins and mapping of post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitylation,  acetylation, glycosylation) by tandem MS, and global quantitative proteomic and phospho-proteomic profiling  by 2D or 3D LC-MS/MS methodology. Routinely employed methods of quantification include stable isotope-  based methods (SILAC, 15N-SIL, AQUA, iTRAQ, TMT) and various label-free techniques (normalized  spectral abundance factor, peak intensity measurements). The Core utilizes a number of advanced data  analysis tools, including the Sorcerer Enterprise Server and the IP2/Census Server. Cancer Center  investigators are utilizing these technologies in a variety of ways, such as identifying novel components of  protein complexes and protein-protein interactions, mapping functionally important post-translational  modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, and comprehensively profiling quantitative  differences in protein abundance in cancer versus normal cells. To facilitate these projects, Core personnel  routinely meet and interact with investigators to provide guidance with project design, sample preparation, and  data analysis. In addition, the Core engages in outreach activities geared toward training investigators in  proteomic technology. In part due to outreach activities, the Core is broadly used, with services provided to 27  Cancer Center members in the past year. The Core's future activities will focus on maintaining high quality  services as well as the exploration, testing, and implementation of novel technologies that will benefit the  Center's research programs. Efforts in planning toward these goals include the implementation of a targeted  proteomics workflow using selected ion monitoring (SRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. In  addition, the Core will work toward the implementation of improved methods for profiling post-translational  modifications (e.g. glycoproteomics and global profiling of ubiquitylated proteins by affinity enrichment). Data  analysis capabilities will also be extended, implementing MaxQuant integrated with Bioconductor, and finding  a computational solution for automated subtraction of unspecific background proteins identified in protein  interaction screens by affinity purification and MS. In the past funding period, 45 Cancer Center members  used the Proteomics Shared Resource and the Core contributed critical data to at least 68 cancer-relevant  publications and 38 grant applications."
"9099784","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Core A will fulfill three major functions. One function is the overall management of the POI, which will be the responsibility of the Pl (Steven Balk) and the co-investigator (Peter Nelson). They will insure that administrative and regulatory requirements are met, but their main focuses will be on enhancing communication and collaboration between the Projects and on optimizing the use of the resources provided by the P01. The second function of the Core is to assist the Projects in efforts to translate their findings into patients. In addition to Drs. Balk and Nelson, Core A includes three investigators with a major focus on the design and conduct of clinical trials in prostate cancer (Drs. Mary-Ellen Taplin, Bruce Montgomery, and Glenn Bubley). Through previous/ongoing clinical trials and tissue banking efforts at their respective institutions, these investigators have collected valuable tissue and serum samples from patients at varying stages of their disease and after varying therapies. In discussions with the Project Leaders, they will facilitate the identification and distribution of relevant coded clinical samples for analysis by the Projects, and will assist in interpreting the clinical significance of the results. Moreover, Drs. Taplin, Montgomery and Bubley will assist the Project Leaders in the design and conduct of preclinical studies that can form the foundation for subsequent phase I or phase 11 clinical trials. The third Core function is to provide statistical support for each of the Project Leaders in their experimental designs. Lillian Werner, in the Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology at DFCI, who also directs the DF/HCC Prostate Cancer SPORE Biostatistics and Computational Biology Core, is dedicating 10% effort specifically to this P01. The specific aims are:  Aim 1. Provide administrative support to insure that the goals of the project are achieved.  Aim 2. Assist in translating the results from each Project into the clinic.  Aim 3. Provide biostatistical support for each Project."
"9143717","Recent studies in our laboratory and others demonstrate that the CDK5 gene or its coactivators is amplified  in a majority of human pancreatic cancers, expressed in all pancreatic cancer cell lines tested and that CDK5  activity increases as a consequence of the action of mutant k-Ras, which in turn enhaces pancreatic cancer  cell growth, invasion and metastasis. We present evidence that the inhibition of CDK5 with a 3, 5-  disubstituted pyrazole significantly reduces tumor size, metastasis, and vascularization of pancreatic tumors  growing as xenografts in nude mice. We propose to study the effects of CDK5 inhibition on pancreatic  adenocarcinoma progression in two distinct mouse models that recapitulate the human disease as it  progresses from pancreatitis to PanIN lesions and from PanIN formation through metastasis. This study will  focus on inhibiting CDK5 alone during early disease development and evaluate the therapeutic capacity of  inhibiting CDK5 in later disease progression, using the inhibitor and Gemcitabine-Abraxane. A second  benefit of inhibiting CDK5 is that it reduces pain, given its role in nociceptive signaling. Consequently, we will  also undertake preclinical studies to determine if CDK5 inhibition blocks pain associated with pancreatitis  and tumor growth. We will also undertake a Phase I human clinical trials that evaluate the clinical utility of  inhibiting CDK5 in advanced pancreatic cancer patients that have failed other therapy options. In the longer  term these studies may enable Phase II clinical trials for treateing pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. We will  also undertake parallel drug design studies to develop next-generation molecules that improve targeting of  CDK5 in pancreatic cancer patients."
"9093730","The controlled collection and processing of clinical specimens from patients with acute and chronic  leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) is a critical activity for  an efficient and comprehensive program in translational research in hematologic malignancies. Accordingly,  the Biospecimen Core (Core A) has one overarching aim: We will collect, store, process, and distribute  biospecimens from all patients with a diagnosis of leukemia, MDS, and MPD seen at this institution to  facilitate biospecimen-based translational research: We will collect malignant cell populations from bone  marrow aspirates and peripheral blood, as well as skin punch biopsy and buccal lavage specimens  representing non-malignant cell populations. Serum and plasma will be collected for future proteomic  biomarker studies. Specimens will be collected throughout each patient's disease course (initial presentation,  remission, relapse) and where appropriate, archival specimens from previous malignancies will be retrieved.  Particular attention to specimen procurement (eg. rapid processing of leukemia cells to preserve transcript  profiles) and quality control will be practiced. Specimens will be processed to cellular RNA, genomic DNA,  whole genome amplified DNA, and protein extracts as required for each study. Cellular populations will also  be viably frozen for future xenograft studies. In collaboration with the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource of  our Cancer Center, we will process and distribute specimens from flow-sorted cell populations. In  collaboration with our clinical Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Cytogenomics, we will ensure that all  specimens used for research are extensively and accurately annotated with molecular diagnostic data. The  aims of this Core will be accomplished by expanding the scope of a well-established Cancer Center Tumor  Bank and an on-going, funded P01 effort to collect AML and MDS biospecimens for genomic analysis.  Specifically, Gore A will expand the number and types of leukemia patients from whom biospecimens will be  collected, and serve as a conduit (through data and specimen sharing) to allow for a broader variety of  translational research studies in hematologic malignancies, using new and previously banked biospecimens.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):   The proposed studies will lead to both an improved understanding of the pathogenesis and new approaches  to the detection, prevention and treatment of hematologic malignancies."
"9149603","Project Summary - Project 2  Project 2 builds on our preliminary data and cumulative reports in the literature that have identified STAT3 as a  target for therapy in HNSCC. Direct injection of a decoy oligonucleotide selectively targeting Signal Transducer  and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) into the HNSCC tumor in a phase 0 clinical trial completed during the  current funding period demonstrated decreased expression of STAT3 target genes in the tumor. To overcome  the requirement for repeated local injection, we chemically modified the STAT3 decoy to create a more stable,  cyclic formulation that can be delivered intravenously with anti-tumor effects and no evidence of toxicity in  mouse models. To maximize selective cyclic STAT3 decoy accumulation in the area with highest tumor  burden, we are now investigating the potential of microbubble (MB) encapsulation of the cyclic STAT3 decoy,  allowing systemic delivery coupled with tumor directed ultrasound to augment regional delivery of the cyclic  STAT3 decoy. Site-directed ultrasound can be tuned to cause destruction of intravenously injected MBs  resulting in release and delivery of the cyclic STAT3 decoy selectively into ultrasound-exposed tumor cells. To  define predictive biomarkers for STAT3 targeted therapy, we will determine the contribution of loss of function  genetic alterations of a key negative regulator of STAT3, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor T (PTPRT),  which we recently reported in HNSCC and other cancers. This project will have 3 aims to test the safety and  feasibility of these approaches to STAT3 targeting:  Aim 1: To conduct a phase I clinical trial of intravenous cyclic STAT3 decoy in patients with  recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. We will evaluate the safety of intravenous cyclic STAT3 decoy, establish the  recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and test the hypothesis that cyclic STAT3 decoy reduces expression of  STAT3 target genes in paired tumor biopsies.  Aim 2: To develop and optimize a platform for ultrasound-targeted MB-mediated delivery of cyclic STAT3  decoy. We will test the hypothesis that MB formulations with maximal cyclic STAT3 decoy loading and  optimized acoustic parameters will cause knockdown of STAT3-regulated genes and cell death using in vitro  and in in vivo HNSCC models.  Aim 3: To determine the anti-tumor efficacy of intravenous cyclic STAT3 decoy combined with the US/MB  platform developed in Aim 2 and the role of PTPRT mutation or hypermethylation in mediating responses. We  will test the hypothesis that combined systemic and local delivery will improve responses, particularly in  PTPRT mutant or hypermethylated tumors."
"9336548","Our research group has characterized the preclinical activity of PHY906 as a modulator of cytotoxicity of anticancer agents as well as a cytoprotective agent of chemotherapy. In this project, we are addressing an important hypothesis, as suggested by our preliminary pre-clinical results, that part of the mechanism for the biological activity of PHY906 involves the modulation of certain key immuoregulatory processes and metabolic functions of tumor and normal tissues, which will be reflected in the immunokine/growth factor and metabolomic profiles from plasma of patients under treatment. We hope to identify the relevant potential biomarkers that can be used to predict the subset of patients who may benefit from the use of PHY906 using multiplex approach. The proposed studies will also to begin indentify the potential multiple sites of action and bioactive compounds of this herbal medicine. This Project has two specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will investigate the potential biomarkers in plasma that can be used to correlate the effect of PHY906 with clinical benefit of irinotecan-based chemotherapy, either toxicity or clinical activity, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. For these studies, a broad series of biomarker analyses will be conducted, and they include the following: profiles of immunocytokines, chemokines, growth factors; metabolomic profiles including steroid hormones; levels of tumor DNA and mutational load distribution analysis as determined by presence of mutations of K-Ras, B-Raf, or PI3K/Akt from tumor DNA in plasma. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the bioactive compounds involved in the action of PHY906 on immunological regulatory pathways. This aim will characterize the chemical profile of PHY906 and their metabolites in each sample taken from patients using LC/MS spectrometry and correlate each plasma's activity against several immunological regulatory signal pathways and DNA repair pathways ex vivo with the goal of identifying bioactive compounds in plasma. The first specific aim may show how PHY906 works from a systems biology point of view, and these studies may also have a general impact on the correlation of those biomarkers with clinical outcomes for other cancer treatments. The second specific aim will confirm our preclinical studies of PHY906, and more importantly, establish new methodologies to identify bioactive candidate compounds for their potential biological actions. This Project is highly and tightly integrated with the other two proposed Projects in this Program, and the information obtained from this work may serve as a novel paradigm for combining Chinese herbal medicine with conventional cancer chemotherapy to treat human cancers."
"9148034","Project Summary/Abstract  The androgen receptor (AR)-directed agents enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate are standard first-line  therapies for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). These  agents are generally well tolerated and effective at delaying disease progression, prolonging survival, and  improving quality of life, but both drugs have limited durations of effectiveness. Patients with refractory disease  typically have poor responses to subsequent AR-targeted agents, and there is currently no predictive  biomarker that aids in the selection of a second-line therapy. Our group and others have identified upregulation  of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as one mechanism of resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate.  Our findings suggest that 1) GR may be a biomarker that can predict whether a patient will respond to  enzalutamide or abiraterone and 2) blocking GR upregulation in enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant  patients could result in tumor responses. In preliminary data, we show that isoforms of GR with variable N-  termini can be expressed in metastatic CRPC, including one called GR?C that has increased capacity to  promote enzalutamide resistance and is detectable in some patient-derived organoid cultures. It will be  necessary to characterize GR?C and other GR isoforms in order to develop GR as a biomarker and a  therapeutic target. Using a laboratory model of enzalutamide resistance, we have also found that GR  expression is epigenetically modulated, and that treatment with an inhibitor of the BET family of proteins  suppresses GR expression and restores enzalutamide sensitivity. Expanding on these findings, we will  leverage our group's laboratory and clinical expertise to 1) investigate the role of GR isoforms in resistance to  enzalutamide, 2) define the broader effects of BET inhibition across a range of preclinical models of prostate  cancer, and 3) investigate the activity of a novel BET inhibitor in men with metastatic CRPC whose disease  has progressed on enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate."

The PRMS evaluation process occurs prior to submission to the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) institutional review board (IRB), called the Human Subjects Committee (HSC). The PRMS process is complementary to the HSC review and does not overlap or duplicate the responsibilities of the HSC. The three components of the PRMS are the Disease Working Groups (DWGs; Parvesh Kumar, MD), the Executive Resourcing Committee (ERC; Raymond P. Perez, MD, Chair) and the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC; Stephen K. Williamson, MD, Chair). Although each component has a unique role, combined these are aligned to ensure that research ideas and protocols are efficiently moved through the system, receive high-quality peer-review and monitoring, and that the research portfolio is consistent with KUCC clinical research priorities. The DWGs are charged with initial review of protocol merit and feasibility, and with prioritizing by disease-site and stage. The ERC reviews protocol resource requirements, available funding, fit within the DWG portfolio, and alignment with KUCC research programs and priorities. The PRMC performs independent scientific merit and biostatistical reviews, including rationale, design, statistical analysis plan, and adequacy of the data safety monitoring. In 2010, a total of 89 new protocols were reviewed by the PRMS for merit, and 240 active protocols were monitored for scientific progress. The PRMC also monitors active protocols at least annually for continued scientific merit, clinical appropriateness, progress toward completion of scientific objectives, and accrual status, and terminates studies as appropriate. The PRMS is overseen by Deputy Director, Kapil N. Bhalla, MD and is administratively supported by the KUCC Clinical Trials Management shared resource."

"8997373","SPORE Research Project 2 (Brentjens/Moskowitz)  Summary  Despite currently available chemotherapy regimens, patients with relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma  (DLBCL) ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) have a very poor prognosis and represent an  area of unmet need. For this reason, novel approaches are needed for this patient population. One novel  approach currently being investigated in the clinical setting is the adoptive transfer of T cells genetically  modified to express artificial T cell receptors termed chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) designed to recognize  target antigens expressed on the tumor cell surface. To this end, a patient's own T cells may be isolated and  through retroviral or lentiviral gene transfer modified to express the CAR thereby redirecting T cell specificity to  the tumor associated antigen. Most B cell malignancies, including most B cell non-Hodgkins lymphomas  (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) express the B  cell specific antigen CD19. Significantly, most DLBCLs similarly express the CD19 antigen. To date we and  several other groups have recently reported initial clinical outcomes of patients with both low grade as well as  aggressive B cell cancers treated with CAR T cells targeted to the CD19 antigen. To date, these clinical  studies have reported anti-tumor responses in patients with low grade B cell CLL and far more markedly in  patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. More recently, clinical outcomes of a small cohort of patients with  relapsed DLBCL treated with CD19 targeted CAR T cells have demonstrated promising but suboptimal  responses, with 4 of 7 patients demonstrating complete remissions (CRs) but only 3 of 4 responses being  relatively durable (9-22 months) with relatively short follow-up. An additional and relevant immune-based  approach to cancer therapy, having only recently demonstrated moderate clinical benefit in the setting of  DLBCL after autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation, is immune-checkpoint blockade through  infusion of antagonistic MAb's targeted to the T cell PD-1 receptor, which when engaged to either the PD-L1 or  PD-L2 ligand induces T cell anergy. As a result, blockade of this T cell checkpoint pathway with PD-1 specific  MAbs may in turn enhance the anti-tumor function of tumor targeted T cells and may further modulate an  otherwise immune suppressive tumor microenvironment to one more suitable for immune targeted tumor  eradication by both CAR T cells as well as recruited endogenous anti-tumor immune effectors. The primary  goal of this project is to optimize CD19 targeted CAR T cell therapy in patients with DLBCL. To this end in Aim  1 we will initially apply our CD19 targeted 19-28z CAR T cell approach to very poor prognosis elderly  relapsed/refractory ASCT ineligible DLBCL patients, a condition representing an unmet medical need, in a  phase I/II clinical trial as a single agent therapy following salvage chemotherapy. In Aim 2 we utilize a  clinically relevant immune competent murine model of DLBCL to investigate the rationale of combining 19-28z  CAR T cell therapy with PD-1 checkpoint inhibition wherein the latter immune-based approach may protect the  CD19 targeted CAR T cells from PD-L1 and PD-L2 mediated anergy or apoptosis and favourably modulate the  tumor microenvironment. Finally, in Aim 3 of this proposal we will translate these studies back into the clinical  setting in a planned second phase I/II clinical trial targeting the same patient population designed to optimize  the anti-tumor efficacy with 19-28z CAR T cell therapy combined with PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade."

"9126432","Identification of mutations in receptor and non-receptor protein kinases that drive malignant transformation of  cancer cells ('driver' mutations) have revolutionized patient care by opening the door to patient-tailored  targeted therapies that can improve patient survival. In order to discover new targets for therapy, we  sequenced the coding regions of -100 melanomas and identified a large number of somatic mutations and  inherited Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs). One of the most important findings of this effort is the  identification ofthe RAC1 signaling pathway as a potential new target for melanoma therapy. The analysis  revealed a recurrent, UV signature activating mutation in this RHO family of small GTPases, RAC[P29S], in  ~5% of melanomas, in addition, the sequencing data revealed mutations in upstream regulators and  downstream effectors of RAC1 pathway in a large numbers of melanoma tumors. Functional studies  demonstrated an important role in proliferation and migration of not only mutant but also melanoma cells that  that donot harbor the P29S mutation. The data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of RACl or its critical  effeGtor(s) can be applied for development of new therapies for melanoma patients. The general goals ofthis  project are to determine the frequency and prognostic significance of RAC[P29S] mutation in sun exposed  melanocytic lesions, and to identify downstream effectors of RACl most likely to be druggable targets in this  pathway. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To determine the frequency of RAC1[P29S] mutation and RACl  expression levels in a large cohort of melanocytic lesions and correlate with pathological features and tumor  progression; Aim 2: To elucidate the downstream targets of activated RACl in melanomas. Aim 3: To  identify small-molecule inhibitors of PAK kinases, the RACl effectors. These studies are likely to provide  new opportunities for drug discovery for melanomas and possibly other cancers that can facilitate patienttailored  targeted therapy."
"9149429","Transgenic Mouse Core Facility Shared Resource:   Project Summary   Biology Shared Resource Group   The ability to introduce foreign genes into the mammalian germ line or to selectively ablate endogenous  genes from the mouse or rat genome, has proven to be one of the most powerful experimental tools available  for understanding specific genetic requirements for tumor promoting regulatory pathways. In the area of  oncology, transgenic mouse models have revealed the molecular pathways by which proto-oncogenes  predispose cells to develop malignant tumors or how tumor suppressor genes maintain normal growth control.  Transgenic strategies have also revolutionized the way we approach the complex problems associated with  carcinogenesis, including the development of novel therapeutic intervention strategies. To support cancer  research and utilization of this powerful technology, the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR)  Transgenic Mouse Core Facility Shared Resource (TMCF-SR) was established in 1998 through the generous  support of the NCI and from funds obtained from the Purdue Office of the Vice President for Research. Since  then, transgenic and gene targeted mouse models produced by the TMCF-SR have had a significant impact on  the research that has been performed within the PCCR. In 2013 alone, the broad range of services provided  by the TMCF-SR supported the research of 10 investigators from the Cell Identity and Signaling (CIS)  Research Program, and from 2010-2013, TMCF-SR support has contributed to over 54 PCCR publications.   The PCCR's TMCF Shared Resource is a state-of-the-art facility that offers a large number of services to  the Center membership, including the creation of transgenic and knock-out mouse and rat models for gain-of-  function and loss-of-function experimental approaches to dissect transcriptional, signaling, and environmental  influences on tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Model systems based on transgenic and knock-  in/knock-out strategies provide approaches that are developmentally, anatomically and physiologically relevant  to human disease, and that can supplement traditional xenograft models for testing new anti-cancer therapies.  Transgenic animal models provide valuable reagents for studying aspects of cancer cell biology, ranging from  the regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression patterns to cell-cell interactions, cell cycle control and  regulation of signal transduction pathways. Additionally, these models have been instrumental in dissecting  the importance of immune cells and stromal infiltrates to tumor progression, and have helped to identify novel  cancer stem cell lineages that are often resistant to conventional chemotherapeutics."

"9187651","Summary  Project 2? Defining the relationship between tumor composition, spatial heterogeneity, drug delivery,  and drug efficacy  The ultimate goal of this project is to determine the physical factors regulating therapeutic distribution and  therapeutic efficacy in brain tumors. To this end, we have developed a highly innovative integrated strategy to  quantitatively map therapeutic distribution with spatially registered characterization of the tumor architecture  and therapeutic efficacy, all within a given tumor specimen. Specifically, in this approach we will combine  MALDI-MSI to quantify drug distribution, stimulated Raman scattering imaging for label free analysis of tumor  architecture with optical imaging resolution, immunohistochemistry to determine the tumor cell state and target  distribution, proximity ligation assays for cellular spatial resolution of signaling response to therapy, and laser-  capture microdissection RNASeq to quantify spatially resolved transcriptional response to therapy. All of these  approaches will be performed in serial sections from individual tumors, thereby enabling the integration of  spatially registered data. Together with mass spectrometry based phosphoproteomics and RNASeq analysis  to quantify the dynamic signaling and transcriptional network response to a spectrum of defined drug  concentrations in additional tumor specimens, the data generated in this project will (1) map spatially  heterogeneous drug distribution and drug efficacy and (2) enable the computational modeling of the physical  factors governing distribution and regulating the cellular and molecular response to different local drug  concentrations.  The novel integration of cutting-edge imaging and systems biology approaches applied to different sections of  the same tumor, combined with computational models to identify the physical factors governing drug  distribution and tumor cell response, will provide unprecedented insight into the complex dynamic behavior of  tumor cells in vivo in response to spatially heterogeneous levels of therapeutics."
"9126429","Detecting melanoma early leads to a nearly 100% cure rate, but diagnosing it at an advanced stage results in less than 20% survival. The power of early diagnosis has made it the major approach to preventing death from melanoma. Yet there is little evidence that large public skin cancer screenings prevent melanoma deaths. Focusing on people at greatest risk would be possible with an early predictor of risk that helps the primary care physician identify patients who should be followed by a dermatologist. This preventive test needs to measure both aspects of melanoma risk: genetic risk and sun-exposure risk. Project 1 focuses on sun-exposure risk because most people with Fitzpatrick Type I skin do not get melanoma. Yet UV exposure is usually ascertained by patient recollections rather than by objective biological indicators of past sun exposure. To overcome this critical barrier to assessing personal UV exposure and thus melanoma risk, we propose to couple two new technologies with Next-Gen sequencing to create genomic surrogate biomarkers of long-term sun exposure. One dosimeter takes advantage of the accumulation of DNA photoproducts in special regions of the genome; the other incorporates our knowledge about clonal expansion of cells in skin. We then evaluate these genomic dosimeter readings in skin for association with melanoma. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Map human genomic regions that are UV damage hotspots or DNA repair slowspots. Aim 2: Quantitate rare UV-mutated genes in skin in vivo. Aim 3: Use genomic regions sensitive to UV photoproducts and mutations as dosimeters to correlate cumulative sunlight exposure in normal skin to risk for melanoma. These studies establish ways to objectively ascertain exposure to cancer risk using modern measurement technologies."

Using this theme as a platform, we will engage  physical scientists, biologists and oncologists at all levels of training to cultivate improved cross-disciplinary  fluency. Ultimately, these efforts will have an enduring impact on the field by educating future scientists and  oncologists and by fostering lasting trans-disciplinary collaborations between established scientists. We will  maximize the education and outreach impact of the center through a multi-tiered strategy to promote  experiential training and communication across a range of educational and career levels:  High school and undergraduate students: We will tap into and expand existing internship and research   opportunity programs at several of our sites to engage both teachers and students in the exciting trans-   disciplinary studies being performed in the MIT/Mayo PS-OC. The central goal for these activities is to   enthuse participants about potential STEM careers and provide real-world experiences at the interface of   physical sciences and oncology.  Graduate student and post-doctoral training: We will establish a cross-training program that will provide funding   for visiting scientists within the MIT/Mayo PS-OC or within the larger PS-ON. The vision of this program is   to enable cross-disciplinary training: physical scientists into biology/clinical settings, and   biologists/oncologists into physical science labs. By providing the funding for weeks-to-months of   interaction time for multiple visiting scientists per year, this program should provide solid experiential   training and immersion in the corresponding field.  Annual symposia and visiting faculty series: An annual conference hosted by the MIT/Mayo PS-OC will rotate   among the sites involved in our center.

"9124860","Bladder cancer (BC) is the fifth most frequent cancer found in the United States (US). Tobacco smoke (TS) is the major cause of BC in US, and tobacco smokers have a 5-fold higher BC incidence than nonsmokers. TS contains more than 60 carcinogens; however, which carcinogens are responsible for BC is not well established. Arylamines, 4-hydroxy-aminoblphenyl (ABP) in particular, are the major cause of occupation-related BC, but the amount of arylamines in TS is minute. In fact, TS contains 100,000 fold more acrolein (Acr) than ABP, and Acr is a potent and organ-specific carcinogen capable of Inducing BC in rat models. Our laboratory has a longstanding interest in studying the role of chemical carcinogen induced DNA damage and repair in tumorigenesis. We recently made three important findings regarding Acr: (1) Acr damages DNA by forming Acr-DNA adducts that are mutagenic; (ii) Acr inhibits DNA repair by modifying and accelerating autophagy-mediated degradation of the modified DNA repair proteins; and (iii) Acr-DNA adducts are poorly repaired in human cells. We propose that Acr Is a major bladder carcinogen and its carcinogenicity Is via these three detrimental effects (Hypothesis 1). Most BC can be classified as either noninvasive (N-lnv) or invasive (Inv); while N-lnv-BC often bear mutations in codon 12 ofthe H-RAS (<20%) and codons 248, 249, 372 and 652 ofthe FGFRS gene (80%), Inv-BC mainly carry mutations in the p53 (30-60%) and RB genes. We hypothesize that these mutation hotspots in BC are Acr preferential binding sites in bladder urothelial cells (Hypothesis 2). We found that DNA damage induces much higher mutations in Inv-BC cells than in N-lnv-BC cells and that N-lnv-BC cells have a much higher DNA damage repair capacity than Inv-BC cells. We also recently found that p63 gene is highly expressed in N-lnv-BC but not in Inv-BC cells, and that introduction of p63 gene elevates DNA repair capacity in Inv-BC cells. These results lead us to hypothesize that H- RAS/FGFR3 mutation-activation enhances DNA repair capacity via activation of p63 and that p53 mutations reduce DNA repair capacity via down regulation of p63 (Hypothesis 3). We will test these hypotheses in cultured human urothelial cells, human bladder tumor tissue samples and transgenic mouse models to understand the relationship between DNA repair capacity and divergent pathways of bladder cancer."
"9148031","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  An age of genomically directed oncology has arrived, catalyzed by efforts to rationally design therapies  targeting the molecular aberrations that promote individual tumor growth and progression. This has led to the  prospective clinical sequencing of patients with active disease to guide their cancer care. Nevertheless, the  utility of such prospective profiling is limited in many cancer types, perhaps most so in men with prostate  cancer. In fact, due in part to their profound clinical and mutational heterogeneity, we know very little about  how to therapeutically target the molecular lesions in the genomes that drive the emergence of the most  aggressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). We must address this urgent challenge to  improve the survival of men with CRPC. We have recently shown that prospective clinical sequencing of  active, advanced prostate cancers with linked clinical annotation can reveal both gene- and pathway-level  genomic aberrations enriched in CRPC. We went on to show that both germline and somatic lesions targeting  genes mediating homologous recombination (HR) were far more common in CRPC than even advanced  castration-sensitive metastases. These findings underscore the potential therapeutic utility of defining the  lesions that drive CRPC, but without a clinical-translational approach that tests these hypotheses clinically, the  gap in our understanding will only widen. We propose to overcome this urgent clinical challenge by first  developing and comprehensively analyzing a one-of-kind cohort of approximately 2,000 sequenced advanced  prostate cancers from patients under active care with detailed clinical annotation, outcome, and treatment-  response data. A major goal of this effort will be to identify alterations associated with progression to  castration-resistance, a strategy that will facilitate the testing of novel approaches to treat such tumors. We will  then assess the extent to which genomic loss of heterozygosity and related hallmarks of HR deficiency are  correlated with different underlying somatic or germline HR/DNA repair genotypes, specific clinical variables,  disease-specific progression, and outcome. Finally, we will clinically test the hypothesis that men with CRPCs  bearing the hallmark of HR dysfunction, including those with germline or somatic BRCA mutations, derive  clinical benefit from PARP inhibition. We will also seek to identify genomic aberrations that condition PARP  inhibitor response and resistance in pre- and post-treatment samples and longitudinally collected tumor-  derived cell-free DNA. Together, these studies seek to establish a translational genomic framework to facilitate  effective, evidence-based precision oncology in men with CRPC by efficiently targeting essential pathways that  drive the progression to advanced disease."
"9148032","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is the key driver of human prostate cancer. Prostate  cancers are almost always sensitive to blockade of the androgen receptor, and tumors with acquired  resistance to these therapies are often sensitive to second-generation inhibitors of the pathway.  However, the vast majority of men with progressive prostate cancer will ultimately succumb to the  disease. Activation of the PI3K signaling pathway is the second most prevalent oncogenic event in  prostate cancer, occurring in the majority of advanced castration-resistant tumors. The PTEN tumor  suppressor gene is lost or inactivated in 40% of these tumors, and genetic events that activate PI3K are  also found in a significant number of patients. While PTEN loss is the most commonly altered regulator  of PI3K signaling in prostate cancer, recent genomic profiling studies of metastatic castration-resistant  prostate cancer (CRPC) have reported activating alterations in the subunits of the PI3K complex  (PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3R1) in approximately 10% to 20% of cases. Our previous work revealed that  activation of AR-signaling or PI3K signaling each cause feedback inhibition of the other in a reciprocal  fashion. As predicted from this finding, inhibition of androgen receptor signaling activates PI3K  signaling in these tumors and correspondingly, inhibitors of PI3K signaling activate AR signaling. It is  likely that relief of feedback inhibition of the other pathway reduces the benefit of therapy with single  agent AR or PI3K inhibitors. In support of this hypothesis, we showed that combined inhibition of both  pathways has profound therapeutic effects in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer. The  major goal of this proposal is to optimize such therapies, tailoring the therapeutic strategy to specific  tumor genotypes. We will do this by determining the biologic consequences of different mechanisms of  PI3K activation in prostate cancer, determining the best means of pharmacologically inhibiting PI3K and  AR signaling in prostate tumors with PTEN loss and/or PI3K activation, and optimizing the dose and  schedule of these combinations in novel organoid and genetically engineered mouse models of  prostate cancer. The aims of this proposal are to explore the biologic consequences of PI3K pathway  activation in AR-driven prostate cancer and to determine the optimal combination regimens with which  to treat these tumors."

It will also serve as the mechanism for CITO members to engage  with other Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OCs), the broader scientific community, and the public,  and to disseminate information and concepts on the physical sciences in cancer research and patient care.  Detailed descriptions of planned programs and activities can be found in the EOU component of this  application; we also summarize them in the Administrative Core (AC) component. We will organize several  types of programs and activities that are intended to: 1) bring in new expertise and perspectives on physical  sciences oncology (conferences, seminars, workshops, public engagement forums); 2) offer trainees and  students avenues for interactive, laboratory- and/or clinic-based education in physical sciences oncology  (fast-track research opportunities); 3) enable CITO investigators to take a sabbatical to other Physical  Sciences-Oncology Network (PS-ON) laboratories as part of cross-training opportunities; 4) disseminate  information to the public on the ideas, technologies, and capabilities of physical sciences oncology, and its  potential impact on cancer research and patient care (via the Community Engagement Program with our  patient advocates); and 5) gather relevant information and feedback from the patient community and the  general public that would continue to guide and drive the CITO's research, educational, and outreach  activities. The AC is charged with managing and facilitating activities for the EOU. Dr. Mauro Ferrari (CITO  Principal Investigator, PI) will set the programmatic framework for the EOU, which will align with the thematic  elements of the CITO Projects and TOC.

"9094433","Our overarching goal is to develop biomarkers that are useful in informing clinical management of CT detected lung nodules of indeterminate etiology. Biomarkers assayed in non-invasively obtained biospecimens need to be developed to enhance the performance of currently evolving lung cancer risk models which are based solely on demographics, clinical and imaging characteristics.    We hypothesize:  1. Biomarkers measurable in non-invasively obtained specimens can discriminate between benign and malignant lung nodules detected by CT.  2. These biomarkers can be incorporated into a prediction model to aid clinical decision making and potentially improve outcomes by shortening time to diagnosis of lung cancer, decreasing biopsy and/or surgery for benign disease, reducing patient anxiety and decreasing costs.    In the current SPORE grant period, we have developed several promising biomarkers and carried out initial validation steps. We now are in the position to assess these prospectively and simultaneously in a population in which they would have immediate clinical applicability, through the following Specific Aims:    1. Develop and test novel measurement tools for the following biomarkers in non-invasively obtained specimens, including: a) Epithelial chromosomal imbalances; b) Circulating protein levels; c) Exhaled breath volatile organic compounds; d) miRNA expression patterns.  2. Compare the performance of the individual biomarkers singly and in combinations in discriminating benign from malignant nodules in a cohort of subjects with indeterminate lung nodules referred to specialty clinics for evaluation.  3. Develop a model based on biomarker outcomes, smoking history, clinical and imaging features for the prediction of malignancy in CT detected lung nodules.    We envision that at the end of this project, the above predictive model can be subjected to further prospective validation in independent cohorts of patients with indeterminate CT detected lung nodules, in which changes in specific outcomes (time to diagnosis, invasive procedures for benign disease, costs) can be simulated."
"9108269","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions):  The Biology of Colon Cancer Program (BCCP) encompasses an organ-systems and translational approach to understanding genetic and environmental factors that establish and maintain normal intestinal mucosal homeostasis and the perturbations that increase the probability for, and drive the development of, intestinal cancer. There are four overlapping themes, with many of the members investigating multiple themes: (I) the tumor microenvironment (inflammation, heterotypic cell interactions, and the intestinal microbiome), and its impact on genome integrity; (ii) maintenance of genomic integrity and the impact of nutrition and aging as major, interacting risk factors for sporadic colon cancer; (iii) intestinal cell maturation and stem cell biology; and (iv) altered metabolism as a marker of risk and driver of tumor development. The broad scientific goals of this program are to: first, understand how normal intestinal maturation and mucosal homeostasis are regulated by the integration of many different inter- and intracellular, and environmental, signals; and second, determine how failure in the integration of these systems compromises genomic integrity and mucosal homeostasis, thus elevating the probability of tumor development and progression. During the last funding period, the BCCP expanded from 11 to 18 members, recruiting both senior and junior faculty many already collaborating with members of the BCCP. Noteworthy additions to the previously existing work in the BCCP are new, interactive investigations on physiological, metabolic and molecular alterations in the intestinal mucosa with age and diet, major risk factors in the development of sporadic colon cancer. Furthermore, the membership of the BCCP will be now be consolidated on the Einstein campus to foster greater interaction with existing AECC programs, the Diabetes Center, the Nathan Shock Center for Aging, and the Stem Cell Institute, and to facilitate extension of the organ-systems approach of this program to other members of the Einstein research community. There are currently 19 members from 9 departments, of whom 15 are new to the program, supported by 12 NCI grants ($2.5M Direct) and 17 other peer reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($6.6M Direct).

"9105322","The aim of the Signaling, Motility and TEM Assays Core is to provide methodology, experimental evaluation,  analysis and interpretation of in vitro assays in order to assess the individual behavior of tumor and stromal  cells as well as their interactions. The Core performs assays examining 2D motile cell behavior, 3D  invasion, and transendothelial migration. These assays permit a complete evaluation of cell behavior during  chemotaxis, invasion and migration across a vascular endothelium, and provide a thorough analysis of the  invasive capabilities of a given cell type prior to costly and time-consuming animal studies. Moreover, these  in vitro assays support and complement the in vivo studies provided by the Multiphoton Imaging, Invasive  and TEM Competent Cell Collection and Analysis Core (Core A). Core B also functions as a programmatic  resource for the use of unique protein biosensors and for assays examining invadopod formation, and thus  ensures that the application of these technologies is uniform across all of the projects. The assays supported  by the Core will permit an acute analysis of the molecular mechanisms used by tumor and stromal cells to  promote tumor cell invasion, intravasation and extravasation.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Services provided by Core B are essential for the overall objectives of the Program Project to define the  detailed interactions between tumor and stromal cells that support invasion and metastasis. These in vitro  assays provide information about cellular behavior and mechanism that is essential for the interpretation of in  vivo and intravital imaging studies. The Core also coordinates the use of unique biochemical reagents,  biosensors and methodologies developed by individual laboratories for distribution to all of the projects."
"9149432","Medicinal Chemistry Research Program:   Project Summary   The Medicinal Chemistry Program (MC) in the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR)  drives the drug discovery effort of the Center by serving as the central component for basic research in cancer  drug discovery and drug discovery methods. The Program consists of 23 members who integrate their  expertise in novel synthetic strategies and advanced technologies with the other Research Programs in the  Center, to advance translation of promising entities to the clinic. During the past four years, nine new cancer-  focused faculty members were recruited to the MC Program. MC members are united by a focus on cancer  drug discovery, and represent diverse disciplines that are drawn from seven academic departments and four  colleges from across the Purdue campus. The MC Program has a strong publication record, producing 286  papers between 2010 and 2013 with 2% involving intra-programmatic collaborations, 19% representing inter-  programmatic and 21% engaging inter-institutional partners; overall, 39% MC publications were a result of  collaborative efforts with other cancer researchers. Combined, the MC membership has a current portfolio of  over $1.7 million of total direct peer-reviewed, extramural support, with 44% of awards being cancer-focused  grants funded by the NCI, NSF, ACS or DOD. The MC Program is structured around two Research Clusters.  Research Cluster 1, Synthetic Medicinal Chemistry, and the cornerstone of the MC Program, reflects the  strengths of the Center in medicinal chemistry. A distinguished group of senior and junior faculty develops and  utilizes target-based medicinal chemistry approaches to drug discovery. The efforts of this group have led to  the development of 13 agents that have been in Phase 0, Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III clinical trials in the  last funding cycle. Ten other agents have progressed to preclinical development (in vivo studies). Research  Cluster 2, Target Discovery and Translation, encompasses a focus on target discovery, in vitro and in cell  molecular evaluation of potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents, and the development and use of in vivo  models and methods for the analysis of potential anti-cancer drugs. Tools have been developed for high-  throughput single cell screening as well as in cell sensing and identifying protein-protein interaction networks.  There is a specific emphasis on comparative oncology including studies of dogs with naturally-occurring  cancers that closely mimic the human condition. The canine models are being evaluated for their impact on the  translation of therapeutic agents to humans. Over the past four years, many MC projects have spawned highly  productive inter-programmatic collaborations involving members of the Cell Identity and Signaling (CIS),  Chemical and Structural Biology (CSB), and Drug Delivery and Molecular Sensing (DDMS) Programs. The  Program Leader and Co-Leader's efforts in cancer-focused faculty recruiting and mentoring, and organizing  Program meetings and the PCCR-based Bladder Cancer Discovery Group, have enhanced the two Research  Clusters and overall research progress of the MC Program."

"9148035","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  One of the primary clinical challenges in prostate cancer is the management of screen-detected, localized  disease. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in ?active surveillance? (conservative management) of  low-risk disease. A corollary has been increased attention to the algorithms used for risk stratification. Although  Gleason grade is strongly predictive of oncologic outcome, it is clear that, while some men with low Gleason  grade on biopsy do in fact harbor high-risk disease, many men with higher Gleason grade would not in fact  experience symptoms of prostate cancer during the natural course of their life even if left untreated. We have  shown that a statistical model based on a panel of kallikrein markers in blood ? total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA  and human kallikrein 2 (hK2) ? strongly predicts risk of high-grade (Gleason score ?7) cancer on biopsy. The  panel has been validated in multiple studies involving close to 15,000 men. We have also demonstrated that  the panel is highly predictive of the long-term risk of distant metastasis in men followed for many years without  screening. We propose to evaluate whether the clinical role of the panel could expand from decisions about  diagnostic biopsy to those concerning immediate treatment decision-making and active surveillance protocols.  We will first use data from five independent cohorts, three from Europe and two from the US, to determine  whether the panel of four kallikrein markers can predict either unfavorable pathology at radical prostatectomy  or post-treatment oncologic outcomes such as metastases. If so, the panel ? data from which may often be  available from the diagnostic biopsy ? could be used to help decisions about treatment versus conservative  management. Our second aim is to determine whether the panel of markers can predict the result of active  surveillance biopsy. If so, using the panel to avoid biopsy in men at low risk of progression would decrease the  number of biopsies required by active surveillance protocols, reducing morbidity and potentially increasing the  acceptability of active surveillance as a management strategy. We also aim to determine whether the  properties of the panel could be improved by either adding a novel marker, microseminoprotein-? (MSMB) or  modifying measured marker levels in the light of marker-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs.)"
"9187531","Summary of Project 1: The Role of Physical Cues in Collective Cell Invasion  The ability of tumors to invade adjacent tissues, leading to local or distant metastasis, is a hallmark of cancer.  Cancer cells frequently invade as groups of adherent cells in a process termed collective invasion. Previous  studies have primarily focused on single cell or semi-collective (multicellular streaming) cell invasion. Single  cell models for metastasis have direct implications for tumors whose cells migrate constitutively as individual  cells, such as leukemias and lymphomas, or after cell detachment from a primary tumor via epithelial-to-  mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, EMT has long been controversial among pathologists as breast  tumors at metastatic sites typically display epithelial features. While EMT-like gene signatures can be observed  in specific mouse models and breast cancer subtypes, the majority of breast tumors do not exhibit clear  molecular features of EMT. Intravital microscopy studies reveal that tumor cells preferentially migrate  collectively along pre-existing channels that are defined by various anatomical structures in vivo. However, it is  currently unknown how the physical properties of the microenvironment, such as confinement and compliance,  regulate the molecular mechanisms of collective cell invasion. Intriguing preliminary data reveal that cancer  cells migrate through wide (?50 m) tracks as a collective unit. However, as confinement increases, the cancer  cells spontaneously disseminate, first as clusters of 2-5 cells and eventually, in very narrow tracks (?10 m), as  single cells. We hypothesize that the physical microenvironment induces a signaling cascade of events that  transforms the classical collective to single cell invasion. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a  multidisciplinary approach combining novel bioengineering tools and mathematical modeling with sophisticated  molecular cell biology and imaging techniques and in vivo models. In Aim 1, we will develop an integrated  experimental and computational model of collective cell movement in confined geometries modeling primary  tumor invasion, and dissect the mechanisms by which cell-cell contact is released during mechanically-induced  transitions to single cell movement, focusing on the role of E-cadherin cleavage and possible EMT induction. In  Aim 2, we will delineate the relative contributions of actomyosin contractility, small GTPases and osmotic  engine model to locomotion in rigid versus compliant confined microenvironments. In Aim 3, we will validate  our in vitro understanding of the dissemination and locomotion of cancer cells in more complex  microenvironments characteristic of in vivo breast tumors using an organotypic 3D culture system and  genetically engineered mouse models. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of collective cancer cell  invasion will offer insights into our understanding of how cancer cells spread through the body, and it could  shift the currently prevailing single cell paradigm in cancer to incorporate concepts of mechanical signaling,  cell-cell adhesion, and cell-cell cooperation."

"9107344","PLANNING & EVALUATION  ABSTRACT  The University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) has undergone a proactive and very deliberate  internal planning and evaluation process that has culminated in the recruitment of new Senior Leaders and the  reorganization and reshaping of the UNMCC Research Programs during the current grant period. Following the  NCI Site Visit of the UNMCC in February 2010 and receipt of the detailed CCSG review, UNMCC Leadership  and Research Program Leaders initiated a strategic planning process. Three Center-wide retreats secured  critical input from Cancer Center members. Regular monthly meetings of the UNMCC Senior Leadership  group, as well as leadership meetings with heads of the UNMCC Research Programs, Clinical Working  Groups, and Shared Resources, were used to obtain multi-faceted input, refine ideas and implement a final  plan. An important outcome of these meetings was the identification of key areas for the recruitment of Senior  Leaders with expertise in cancer control and prevention, translational research, drug development and early  phase clinical trials. The UNMCC External Advisory Committee (EAC) played a critical role in the strategic  planning and evaluation activities through annual visits and written feedback. As recommended by the EAC,  the UNMCC has established a new Internal Advisory Committee that includes leaders from our Consortium  institutions, the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, and our communities, to enhance strategic  planning and evaluation activities as the UNMCC increases in size and complexity. A Director's Lecture Series  was utilized to garner advice from internationally recognized experts on UNMCC activities. These ad hoc  external evaluations were used to critically evaluate the UNMCC Research Programs and clinical research  activities. Following the recruitment of new Senior Leaders in the summer of 2013, a series of Senior  Leadership retreats and special evening meetings with Research Program leaders were utilized to evaluate all  aspects of UNMCC structure and function. This culminated in a proposal to transform the UNMCC Research  Program structure from a mix of basic and tumor-focused programs into four comprehensive programs that  each seamlessly span basic research to clinical translation. The four new programs, Cancer Control; Cancer  Genetics, Epigenetic and Genomics; Translational Cancer Biology and Signaling; and Cancer Therapeutics:  Technology, Discovery, & Targeting Delivery, were subsequently endorsed by the UNMCC EAC and approved  by the NCI. The new, more fluid and flexible structure has increased interactions and coordination between the  UNMCC Research Programs and Clinical Working Groups. In addition, the UNMCC pilot grant program has  been modified to foster the development of the new research programs and promote translational research.  Finally, a strategic plan has been developed to align Shared Resource capabilities with the evolving goals and  research activities of the UNMCC with an emphasis on enhancing patient-centered and cancer control  research activities that address cancer disparities among the diverse, multi-ethnic populations of New Mexico."

"9079372","The Tissue and Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (TDAAC) functions as the primary tissue acquisition and processing facility for human solid tissue and hematopoietic specimens to support translational research at the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS). To this end, TDAAC 1) maintains a biorepository, operating under an IRB approved protocol to store samples for future research studies and 2) collects samples for specific investigator-initiated IRB approved research projects and investigator-initiated clinical trials. For each specimen, TDAAC collects and maintains the associated clinical and pathological annotation and can provide this information under an anonymous honest broker system or for specific IRB approved protocols.    These services are achieved through leveraging a network of interdepartmental and informatics relationships within VCU. TDAAC acquires specimens along with informed consent from patients undergoing routine clinical procedures at the VCUHS. TDAAC staff, in collaboration with Department of Pathology based Molecular Morphology Genomics Laboratory and Laser Capture Microdissection Laboratory, can provide samples of extracted, quality controlled RNA and DNA from human tissues, frozen sections, and cryopreserved samples of viable hematopoietic neoplasias. The specimen acquisition process ensures that the primary purpose of the specimen for patient care is maintained and the quality of the specimen is optimal for biomedical research.    TDAAC's strategic importance resides in the growing need in modern cancer research for investigators to demonstrate that studies in model systems have relevance in human cancers. This shared resource provides services to a wide range of investigators from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC), the VCU research community, and collaborating institutions outside VCU. Over the years 2008-2010, the shared resource collected 2,428 solid tissue and hematopoietic specimens and obtained informed consent on nearly 1,600 patients and provided services to over 30 MCC members.

"9149426","Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource:   Project Summary   Chemistry Shared Resource Group   Mass spectrometry is an essential analytical technique for the identification and structure elucidation of the  wide variety of compounds that are important to the Purdue Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) members'  research projects. These projects include studies on the design and synthesis of therapeutic agents for cancer  treatment, the creation of diagnostic agents, and the investigation of basic cellular processes involved in  cancer cell biology. Of additional importance is the ability of mass spectrometry to sort out reaction products to  facilitate increased yield and understand where a reaction might be going wrong when the expected product is  not obtained.   As part of the Campus-wide Mass Spectrometry Center, the Mass Spectrometry Shared Resource (MS-  SR) provides PCCR members access to all of the facility's mass spectrometers. This includes support for both  routine analyses and collaborative analytical mass spectrometric capabilities (including problem solving by  mass spectrometry). Taking advantage of the MS-SR staff's experience, in addition to routine mass  spectrometry analyses, considerable effort has been made to make each of the ionization techniques a center  of excellence for solving the difficult mass spectrometry research problems associated with PCCR research  projects. The MS-SR currently has six mass spectrometers available to PCCR members.

"9149604","Project Summary Project 3  Despite overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on nearly all head and neck squamous  cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab is effective only in a  minority of patients. The modest effects of cetuximab have stimulated interest in determining its anti-tumor  mechanisms and the factors that limit clinical responses, in order to improve its efficacy by combining  immunotherapeutic approaches. A growing body of evidence, and our preliminary results, indicate that a tumor  antigen (TA)-specific mAb, such as cetuximab, can effectively trigger TA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)  responses. However, these effector CTLs are not fully effective, raising the possibility that inhibitory  mechanisms limit the efficacy of cetuximab in the majority of patients. Blockade of these inhibitory  mechanisms could restore anti-tumor activity and enhance cetuximab efficacy. However, the inhibitory  mechanism(s) that are primarily responsible for limiting cetuximab efficacy remain unknown. A high frequency  of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (PBL) and tumor infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TIL) in multiple solid tumors,  including HNSCC, express elevated levels of inhibitory receptors (so-called ?checkpoints?), such as cytotoxic T  lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1), rendering them unresponsive to antigenic  stimulation (exhaustion). Furthermore, CTLA-4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), a potently suppressive sup-  population of CD4+ T cells that produce TGF-?, are often present at increased frequencies and with enhanced  suppressive capacity in tumors. Collectively, inhibitory receptors on CTL and Tregs are major barriers to  effective anti-tumor T cell responses, which has been demonstrated by striking clinical responses to anti-  CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our previous studies and preliminary data support a working model in  which the generation of TA-specific CD8+ T cells triggered by cetuximab in the non-responder patient  population occurs concurrently with increased inhibitory mechanisms (including TGF-?) that reduce the clinical  response to cetuximab therapy. This project will take advantage of the availability of biospecimens from two  novel UPCI clinical trials, which have either recently completed (UPCI 08-013, testing immune biomarkers in  single-agent cetuximab treated patients)) or are ongoing (UPCI 12-084, combining cetuximab with anti-CTLA-4  mAb ipilimumab to inhibit Treg). We will determine whether inhibitory mechanisms are responsible for limiting  anti-tumor activity induced in cetuximab-treated HNSCC patients and directly assess the impact of CTLA4+  Tregs in this new, ongoing clinical trial."

"9126437","The primary goal of the Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to provide limited support (maximum of $50,000/year, typically for no more than two years) for a broad spectrum of innovative skin cancer pilot projects (involving research, resources, and technology development applicable to human skin cancer risk, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment). Such feasibility/pilot projects must have promising translational research potential, i.e., there must be the expectation that they can evolve, or be incorporated into, full projects with an unequivocal translational component, such that they could replace other completed or sub-optimally progressing projects previously funded within this SPORE. An alternative satisfactory outcome for a funded pilot project would be its development into a research project capable of successfully competing for independent, ROI-type funding. A total of at least $250,000/year will be utilized for Developmental Research Projects ($100,000 in direct costs;, $100,000 in institutional matching funds guaranteed by the Yale Cancer Center, and at least $50,000/year guaranteed by the Department of Dermatology to specifically be used to help support translation to early phase clinical trials of scientific advances made as a result of YSPORE primary/full, developmental or career development projects. A second goal of this DRP is broaden the base of investigators within the Yale research community who are actively engaged in research related to human skin cancer. During Its initial five-year funding period, from 31 new applications for funding, the YSPORE DRP has funded 16 different projects (15 related to melanoma, 1 to cutaneous T cell lymphoma) involving 27 different investigators from 12 different departments/sections. Six additional pilot projects (9 investigators from 8 departments) received more limited support via the YSPORE Administrative Core discretionary funds.

"9105315","Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide. While advance have been made in  treatment this disease still accounts for the second largest number of cancer deaths in women in the US.  These deaths are largely due to metastatic disease. This proposal is based upon observations by project  leaders (PL) and other members of the PPG that tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role  in promoting the rate-limiting steps of metastasis - tumor cell intravasation and extravasation. Central to  these observations was the definition by the PL of TAM sub-populations defined by their transcriptome and  cell surface markers. Thus different populations have individual functions including in the primary tumor the  stimulation of angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion and intravasation as well as at metastatic sites extravasation  and persistent growth. In this proposal we have three specific aims: Aim 1: Mechanisms for Monocyte  Recruitment and Macrophage Differentiation in the Primary Tumor. In this aim the mechanism of  recruitment and differentiation of the different populations to the primary tumor will be studied with a  particular focus upon those macrophages that stimulate invasion and intravasation. We will use novel  methods for fate mapping macrophages to explore their origin and plasticity in the tumor. Aim 2: Molecular  basis for the Promotion of Extravasation by of Metastasis Associated Macrophages. This aim will  define the signaling pathways that convert macrophages into those that promote extravasation of tumor  cells. It will discover the mechanism whereby macrophages enable tumor cells to egress through the  endothelial layer. Aim3: Definition of Pro-Tumoral Functions of Human breast Cancer TAMs Studies will  be translated from mouse models into human breast cancer. Human TAMs from various disease sub-types  will be isolated followed by ex vivo assays for function. These assays together with transcriptional profiles  will define signaling pathways and determine whether they parallel those found in mice. Together these  studies will enable therapeutic targets aimed at sub-populations of macrophages rather than the pan-  macrophage therapeutics currently in trial that have toxicities because that target all resident macrophages.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  In the US -250,000 new cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma are diagnosed each year with 40,000  deaths. Over the last decade statistics show an improvement in survival for women with local disease but no  change for those with metastatic disease. This depressing statistic demands new therapeutic approaches.  In this application we propose that one strategy to improve treatment is to target the tumor microenvironment  and particularly the macrophages within it in order to remove their pro-tumor support."
"9001923","CPDM Summary  The Clinical Research Support (CRS) office serves as the principal mechanism for Clinical Protocol and Data  Management (CPDM) in the Consortium. CRS facilitates the efficient review, approval, and implementation of  cancer clinical research throughout the Consortium. CRS services include assistance throughout the protocol  life cycle, including protocol development, navigation through review and approval processes, guidance and  support in regulatory affairs, training and education, communications, registration of new trials with NCI CTRP,  interim staffing, management of cooperative group trials, quality control and assurance, and data and safety  management. In 2013, CRS supported 1168 studies, a 29% increase over 2008 and 23% of newly treated  patients participated in a therapeutic clinical trial. Since CRS directly manages Consortium training, protocol  submission through activation, protocol and consent form control, and provides other critical aspects of clinical  trials, its impact to the Consortium's research base is exceptionally strong, and all investigators and study  teams conducting clinical research use its services on an everyday basis through the life of a study. CRS staff  members are organized into four interactive divisions: Study Implementation Support, Quality and Compliance,  Study Support Services, and Data Management and Reporting. Data and safety monitoring encompasses all  aspects of data monitoring, verifying data validity and integrity, and ensuring the safety of study participants in  clinical trials and clinical trials are monitored based on degree of risk, size and complexity. Together, the Data  Safety Monitoring Committee and its Compliance sub-committee ensure that investigator initiated trials are  conducted according to all required policies and procedures in order to protect the rights and welfare of human  subjects. The Consortium is committed to increasing the participation of minorities and children in clinical  research by continuing to build trust and engagement with these populations in our catchment area. New  initiatives are underway to minimize barriers to using the health care services of partner institutions, remove  eligibility, recruitment or participation barriers, and find ways to encourage participation and retention for  populations of all types."
"9108274","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Molecular Cytogenetic Shared Resource (MCSR) provides tools for the preparation of human and murine samples suitable for molecular genetic and cytogenetic analysis of the entire genome. The goal is to provide Cancer Center investigators with the whole spectrum of services necessary to analyze the genome at various levels of resolution. These services include the establishment of EBV transformed cell lines and isolation of DNA and mRNA from a variety of tissue culture samples as well as primary biopsies. The facility operates in conjunction with the Genomics Shared Resource to create a direct pipeline for the provision of genomic material for analysis.

The MCSR provides analyses at all cytogenetic levels of resolution from standard to spectral karyotyping and from whole chromosome paints to locus-specific probes for unique regions of the genome. MCSR personnel are trained to design targeted, locus-specific probes for regions of interest to investigators. All probes are custom designed and generated in-house. The MCSR also performs hybridizations on paraffin-embedded tissues as well as image acquisition and full data analysis."
"9001927","Cancer Basic Biology Program  The Cancer Basic Biology Program (CBB) aims to understand the fundamental genomic and cellular  mechanisms that regulate the normal and transformed phenotype; to develop new molecular approaches and  tools to advance cancer diagnosis and therapy; and to develop with other Consortium programs the intellectual  and technical infrastructure to advance translational cancer research. There are three major scientific themes:  1. The biology of the nucleus in normal and tumor cells, with a focus on mechanisms regulating altered gene  expression and the loss of genome stability in cancer; 2. Regulation of normal and cancer cell phenotypes  including the regulation of the cell cycle and motility, and the use of genetic, metabolic and high-throughput  screening strategies to improve cancer diagnosis and therapy; and 3. Protein design and genome engineering  as enabling technologies to advance basic and translational cancer biology. The CCSG supports this research  program by providing key shared resources, particularly Genomics, Proteomics, Cellular Imaging and  Comparative Medicine; administrative support for meetings, clubs and interest groups; and pilot funding and  new investigator funds.  The Cancer Basic Biology Program currently has 73 members from 18 departments and 2 Institutions. 42  members have primary appointments at FHCRC and 31 at UW. 68 Members (93%) have peer-reviewed  funding or are newly recruited and supported by their institution.  The Cancer Basic Biology Program currently has $32.6M in peer-reviewed funding (direct) $7.1 of which (21%)  is from NCI. Due to the tradition of basic research in small independent laboratories, most support is in the  form of R01s.  The Cancer Basic Biology Program published a total of 1116 papers in the previous grant period: 12% were  intra-programmatic, 17% were inter-programmatic, and 11% were inter-institutional."
"9124862","The three research projects that comprise this Program Project are all focused on understanding molecular and cellular events and mechanisms leading to bladder carcinogenesis of both major pathways of low-grade, non-invasive and high-grade, invasive bladder cancer. In addition t o t h e intellectual and experimental synergies that link the individual projects into a cohesive program, each ofthe three proposed research plans all depend upon a common set of critical reagents and services made available on a continuous basis for their success. These include but are not limited to a set of cultured cell lines that represent different stages of bladder cancer, different unique mouse models of bladder cancer developed by Dr. Xue-Ru Wu, recombinant proteins, nucleic acid reagents, antibodies and cDNA constructs. Obviously, it would not make sense, nor would It be an efficient use of time, money, and resources for each laboratory to Independently generate, procure, characterize, and maintain all these reagents. Instead, we will establish a centralized Reagent and Service Core, one of whose purposes is to serve as a central repository for key reagents and provide a central supply for these important research tools that can be shared by all involved in this Program Project. In addition to the cost-effectiveness, this approach offers the advantage of ensuring the quality of these shared reagents across the individual projects. Providing supplies of cell lines, tissues and animal models from a centralized core eliminates variability in reagent handling, facilitating data comparison amongst the three individual projects. Furthermore, it promotes additional interactions among the Pis and guards against accidental loss of Invaluable reagents in emergency situations such as power outages (which we last experienced in 2003). Finally, the Core will also provide pathology and statistical support for the individual projects. In this section ofthe Program Project application, we describe these reagents, how the Core functions to control quality and maintain databases, the contribution ofthe core to the individual research projects, and a plan for prioritizing usage of core services. The specific aims ofthe Core are: i) To maintain a centralized supply and distribute a common core set of reagents vital to support the research efforts of individual component projects; ii) To collect human and mouse specimens and provide the necessary pathology support service; and iii) To provide dedicated statistical support."

"9001918","Therapeutic Manufacturing Shared Resource  Project Summary/Abstract  The Therapeutic Manufacturing Shared Resource (TMSR) offers a broad range of facilities and qualified  trained personnel to support the development and manufacturing of novel biological molecules and innovative  cell-based therapies for Phase I/II clinical testing. These facilities are an integral part of the Consortium's  world-renowned translational research efforts. To enhance these endeavors, the resource has consolidated  two Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facilities into one jointly co-administered and operated Therapeutic  Manufacturing Shared Resource. Combining the Biologics Production and Cell Processing Facilities  (previously supported by this grant) has allowed the Consortium to further build on their leadership role in the  application of immunotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies, and to extend this innovative  work to other clinical settings such as autoimmune disorders, melanoma, sarcoma, breast, ovary, and prostate  cancers.  Formation of this combined unit greatly enhances efficiencies of operation, thus providing more Consortium  investigators with greater access to a wider range of therapeutic products. GMP manufacturing capabilities  include specialized equipment and trained staffing necessary for supporting clinical studies that incorporate  specific cell selection, genetic modification and/or ex vivo manipulation of patient stem cells, dendritic cells and  T-cells, as well as the production of research and clinical grade monoclonal antibodies, antibody-streptavidin  fusion proteins, vaccines, lentivirus vectors and other therapeutic molecules. The facilities assist investigators  at the University of Washington (UW), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), Seattle Cancer  Care Alliance (SCCA), and Seattle Children's Hospital (Children's) in their pre-clinical research efforts, pilot  production requirements, clinical trial design, and other support activities needed for filing of both  Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications and Drug Master Files (DMF), and finally for clinical manufacturing  activities once IND approval has been received, all while providing appropriate levels of quality control, quality  assurance, and regulatory oversight to ensure compliance with strict FDA requirements."
"9099786","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The Steroid Analytical Core will provide sophisticated analytical methodologies for measuring the androgen metabolome with sufficient sensitivity and selectivity in different biological matrices for all Projects in the Program, for the Administrative/Clinical/Biostatistics Core A and for the Biospecimen/Animal Model Facility Core B. These matrices include medium from prostate cancer lines maintained in culture, xenograft models of castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and serum from their immunodeficient murine hosts.  Ultimately, these methods can be applied to patient specimens (serum, prostate and bone biopsies) to determine the efficacy of different androgen ablative therapies in CRPC, and to help identify mechanisms of resistance to these therapies. Stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) of androgens and their precursor pregnanes will be the methodology employed. The LC/MS assays developed and provided in this core will be unique since no existing assays with sufficient sensitivity and selectivity are currently available to detect and quantitate all the steroids of interest. A unique resource of the Steroid Analytical Core is access to a panel of recombinant ketosteroid reductases (aldo-keto reductases) that can be used as synthons to generate the required [13C]-labeled internal standards. The Steroid Analytical Core will provide access to state-of-the art instrumentation and methods that will be cost-effective to measure steroid levels (androgens and pregnanes) not routinely available in the laboratories of individual investigators. It will assist investigators in the design of their experiments so that they are compatible with the analytical tools available. The specific aims of the Core are as follows: [1] To provide stable isotope dilution LC/MS methodology for the analysis of ketoandrogens in a variety of biological matrices (e.g. serum, cell culture, prostate tissue, and prostate and bone biopsies); [2] To provide stable isotope dilution LC/MS methodology for the analysis of hydroxyandrogens in identical biological matrices; and [3] To provide stable isotope dilution LC/MS methodology for the analysis of pregnane precursors of androgens in identical biological matrices. Since these methods are not routinely available elsewhere the Steroid Analytical Core will have an impact on prostate cancer research beyond this P01."
"9149599","Project Summary Core 2 Histology/Tissue  The University of Pittsburgh Head and Neck Cancer SPORE will continue to maintain and expand a  Histology/Tissue Banking Core to ensure efficient use of head and neck biospecimens and provide specialized  histologic evaluation of these tissues for the SPORE research projects and developmental programs. The goal  is to provide sufficient and well-characterized tissues of the highest quality in support of the research studies in  this SPORE and those of collaborating institutions and entities. Tissue specimens as well as blood and body  fluid samples are systematically collected from head and neck caner patients and in this renewal, from  individuals with thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer. The Core is responsible for collection, triage, processing and  distribution or storage of specimen and tissue histopathology, tissue microarray generation,  immunohistochemistry (IHC), and interpretation. Research specimens, including snap-frozen OCT-embedded,  archival or fresh tissue blocks, cells (tumor or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) dissociated from tissues,  peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and paraffin-embedded or frozen tissue sections for IIHC analyses and  tissue microarrays, are triaged for distribution to SPORE investigators, as specified by research protocols.  Microdissection of tissues and extraction of RNA and/or DNA for molecular assays may also be performed.  The Core banks any samples that are not used immediately by SPORE investigators for future use by DRP  and/or CDP awardees and/or collaborators at other institutions. Histopathologic analysis by Core Pathologists  confirms the quality and quantity of tumor in research specimens. IHC is used to detect cellular biomarkers,  whose expression in target tissues may be correlated with response to therapy or clinical outcome. The Core  tracks samples and facilitates the sharing of specimens by the research laboratories according to a priority  schema that is reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the SPORE. Specimen processing,  inventory, and distribution data and histopathologic analyses are maintained in the Core?s computerized  database with links to the Informatics component of the Core 3 for storage and archiving to facilitate a web-  based retrieval system. This database is designed for use by all SPORE investigators. New efforts in this  renewal include: 1) generation of prospective tissue microarrays by organ site and clinical cohort; 2)  development and characterization of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs); 3) next-generation sequencing of  thyroid nodules and thyroid cancers; and 4) development of molecular CLIA assays for use in SPORE trials."
"9125768","Targeted therapeutics designed against specific oncogenic genomic alterations have had a large  clinical impact. Recently, large-scale sequencing studies have identified recurrent, gain-of-function IDH gene  mutations in a significant subset of glioblastomas, with particular enrichment in malignant gliomas of younger  adults (age 18-45). The mutant enzyme catalyzes the production of the novel oncometabolite 2-  hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Increased levels of 2-HG inhibits the 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase class  of enzymes in cells that impact a range of cellular functions including chromatin structure and the epigenetic  control of gene expression, which are thought to promote tumorigenesis. Because 2-HG is not found at  appreciable quantities in normal cells, where basal levels are cleared via 2-HG dehydrogenase, the  accumulation to millimolar levels in human gliomas suggests that it could be an ideal biomarker for mutant  enzyme activity. Understanding the requirements for mutant IDHI activity in existing tumors, and whether 2-  HG levels can serve as a surrogate for mutant enzyme activity in patients are critical issues for the  development of new targeted therapies in this disease. In preliminary studies, we and others have  characterized the biological correlates and potentially actionable avenues for inducing therapeutic response  in IDH mutant gliomas. In Project 3, we will use clinical material to test the hypotheses that non-invasive  measurement of 2-HG levels can serve as surrogate for IDH mutant enzyme activity, and that targeting of  IDH mutation and 2-HG may be a novel therapeutic strategy for malignant glioma patients.  The basic scientist on this project (W Kaelin) is a Howard Hughes Investigator and molecular  biologist, and the clinical investigator (DP Cahill) is a practicing neurosurgeon. Dr Kaolin's group helped  define the functional metabolic consequences of IDHI mutation and 2-HG production on the epigenome of  cancer cells, was the first to show that mutant IDH1 transforms human astrocytes in vitro, and was the first to  demonstrate that a potential therapeutic intervention (EglN inhibition) can selectively target the abnormal  biochemical environment within 1DH1 mutant tumors. Dr. Cahill's lab performed IDH stratification of the  recent national RTOG-0525 trial in glioblastoma, and with his colleagues, has established IDHI-mutant  orthotopic xenograft glioma models derived from freshly resected patient tumor samples. We believe that  the successful execution of Project 3 will support the future development of clinical trials for 1DH1 mutant  gliomas."

"9194210","The burden of cancer and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Vietnam has been surging and will only continue to rise.  Cancer and other NCD research in Vietnam, however, has been very scant and is limited by the paucity of well-trained  researchers, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of population-based cancer registries. To address these challenges, we  plan to establish a US-China-Vietnam partnership to consolidate expertise and mobilize resources from multiple  institutes to build an RCRE for cancer and other NCD research in Vietnam. The short-term goals for the RCRE are: to  assess Vietnam?s unique health needs by means of a national consultative meeting in order to define priorities in NCD  research; and to identify Vietnam?s current limitations in NCD research capabilities and infrastructure with a goal of  building research capacity. The latter will be achieved through the delivery of an in-country workshop, site visits to  Vanderbilt University and Shanghai partner institutes, two short-term visiting scholarships, and by conducting two  demonstration research projects, which will include the development of research protocols and survey instruments and  the collection of biospecimens. Through these research activities, we will establish three research support cores: a  Survey Research Support Core, a Biospecimen Processing and Biorepository Core, and a Biostatistics and Informatics  Support Core, which together will comprise the essential infrastructure and resources needed to support population-  based epidemiological studies for NCD. The two demonstration research projects will focus on investigating the  influence of westernization on breast cancer and diabetes, two diseases of significant public health concern in Vietnam.  The biospecimens collected in the research projects, the experience gained by RCRE investigators, and the results  generated will set the stage for the initiation of a general population-based cohort study for NCD research and a cancer  survival cohort in the near future (a middle-term goal). The workshop plus the 2-month visiting scholarship training at  the Shanghai CDC will be designed to help Vietnam establish a population-based cancer registry and enhance its cancer  registry functions (a middle-term goal). Our long-term goal is to establish an RCRE that is self-sustaining with respect to  resources and technology, staffed with well-trained investigators who possess the capability to lead high-impact NCD  research and training in Vietnam. We also expect that the accomplishments and benefits accruing from this successful  RCRE will extend beyond Vietnam to nearby LMIC countries."
"9187676","TRANSPORT ONCOPHYSICS CORE ? SUMMARY  Cancer immunotherapy has recently been demonstrated to be quite effective for the treatment of lung cancer  and melanoma, but for other indications including breast and pancreatic cancers, its application remains to be  determined, given the additional challenges posed by the latter cancers (low immunogenicity). We believe that  optimizing the transport and penetration of drugs and immune cells, systemically and in the tumor  microenvironment, would improve the immune response in these cancers. Thus, the impact of transport  phenomena (physical spatio-temporal parameters and aberrations of tumors) on immunotherapeutic efficacy  should be considered for the development of effective immunotherapies. The proposed Center for  Immunotherapeutic Transport Oncophysics (CITO) is focused on determining these transport phenomena  in breast and pancreatic tumor models, in order to improve the transport of immunotherapies through tissues  and, ultimately, to enable the rational design of optimal immunotherapeutic regimens for patients as part of  individualized therapy. To support the CITO and its 2 research projects [Project 1 for the transport of cancer  Nano-dendritic (DC) vaccines; Project 2 for the biophysical barriers in the tumor microenvironment], the  Transport Oncophysics Core (TOC) will provide imaging, analysis, quantification, and unique oncophysical  computational tools to rationalize the delivery of immunotherapies, based on the oncophysical modeling  framework Transport and Biodistribution Theory (TBT). The TBT moves boundaries from classical tools used  to study pharmacokinetic and efficacy relations, and instead creates novel precision immunotherapeutic tools  to rationally tailor individual treatments to patients. The overall hypothesis of the TOC is that the biophysical  properties of tissues (as biological barriers) are determinants that govern biodistribution of  immunotherapeutics, upstream of (but in synergy with) specific biological target recognition. The distribution  affects efficacy, adverse effects, and resistance phenomena, and, ultimately - patient outcomes. The TOC will  aggregate data from the two projects and then provide specific services to rationalize development of and to  improve the delivery of immunotherapeutics. The TOC will offer three major services to the projects: imaging  (PET, IVM), data analysis and quantification, and application of computational biodistribution and tumor growth  models. The underlying logic is that in vivo and pathology imaging provides snapshots and time-lapses of the  biodistribution of therapeutics. The quantification of individual time-points and transport dynamics will create  time series of data for computational models to develop spatio-temporal biodistribution, which is a function of  the tumor microenvironment, immunotherapeutic modality, and their transport properties at therapeutically  relevant time-scales. Biodistribution of immunotherapy agents and the effects of adjuvants controlling transport  of immunotherapies will be correlated to therapeutic outcomes and tumor growth."
"9149433","Drug Delivery and Molecular Sensing Research Program:   Project Summary   The Drug Delivery and Molecular Sensing (DDMS) Program serves as the technology arm of the PCCR,  enabling advances in imaging, separations, biosensing and targeted delivery, that can be applied toward basic  discoveries and translational efforts in cancer research. DDMS is comprised of 19 faculty members from 11  Purdue academic departments. DDMS provides collective expertise in cellular and tissue imaging, design of  drug delivery vehicles and biomimetic platforms for drug testing, and novel bioanalytical methods that couple  synergetically with other PCCR Research Programs and that advance our understanding of cancer-driven  processes at the molecular level. During this last CCSG funding period, five new members were recruited from  the applied sciences and engineering departments, further increasing DDMS's diverse strengths in biomedical  imaging, bioanalytical separations, and in vitro testing. DDMS members share a common thread in the  invention and application of new technologies for cancer detection, and for enhancing the effects of cancer  treatment. DDMS has been highly productive in this regard, having producing 519 papers between 2010 and  May 2014, 20% representing collaborative interactions with PCCR members and other NCI-designated cancer  centers. DDMS efforts are sustained by $4.1 million of direct cost, peer-reviewed extramural support.   DDMS is structured around three Research Themes: (1) Imaging Tools for Cancer Biology and Clinical  Cancer Analysis, with breakthroughs in the imaging of advanced brain cancers and in the discovery of new  metabolite-based markers associated with cancer progression; (2) Technologies for Investigating Biomolecular  Processes and Biomarker Detection, which has produced novel methods for decoding epigenetic pathways  and detecting RNA transcripts in live cells, and new platforms for detecting rare cancer cells from clinical blood  samples or for evaluating the impact of cancer therapy on resected tissue samples; and (3) Molecular  Conjugates and Materials for Drug Delivery, which has discovered and validated molecular delivery systems  for new targets at the interface of cancer and immunology, and targeting ligands for different cancer types. All  of these research efforts have resulted in new collaborations with PCCR's other Research Programs (e.g. CIS,  MC, and CSB) and have been critically supported by PCCR Shared Resources; moreover, several research  advances have resulted in the creation of new startup companies and the generation of intellectual property.  DDMS Program Leaders have been active in renewing directions by organizing topical workshops, recruiting  and providing mentorship to new members with cancer-focused research projects, in cooperation with the  PESO Discovery Group, and assembling teams around cancer-related themes that target the submission of  multi-investigator research grants. Examples include in vitro testing platforms that can address unmet needs in  drug delivery research, spatiotemporal analysis of metabolite-based cancer markers based on multimodal  imaging, and 3-D tissue culture models for investigating microenvironmental effects on vasculogenesis."
"9001929","Program in Global Oncology  Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer is increasingly recognized as a threat to the health of people worldwide. Current estimates are that  70% of new cancer cases will be in low- and middle-income countries by 2020. Drivers of these statistics  include increasing life spans due to overall health and reductions in childhood and adult mortality; increasing  obesity; higher smoking rates; and, in Africa, increasing rates of cancer associated with the growing number of  long-term survivors of HIV. These trends are likely to continue. Cancer mortality rates are also higher in  resource-poor economies.  The goal of the Program in Global Oncology (PiGO) is to develop a robust research program that allows in-  country investigators to develop data-driven approaches to the prevention and treatment of cancers of  relevance in their region, as well as to develop a robust research enterprise that leverages the resources and  opportunities in these countries to increase our understanding of cancer, especially those that are rare in the  developed world and common in the developing world. Research conducted outside the U.S. has elucidated  novel cancer risk factors, described unique molecular signatures for common malignancies, and suggested  potential new strategies for cancer prevention and treatment. PiGO leverages the resources of our Cancer  Center to lead effective research outside the U.S. through four Specific Aims: 1) Leverage data systems,  methods and visualization to support global surveillance of cancer; 2) Expand our studies of tumors from HIV-  infected and non-HIV-infected individuals to determine how and whether these cancers differ, utilizing the  human and physical infrastructure we have developed in Uganda, South Africa and select areas in China; 3)  Further develop a robust multidisciplinary research program to discover novel infection-related cancers, with  particular emphasis on HIV-infected individuals; and 4) Develop effective in-country guidelines to improve the  detection, potential prevention and treatment of common cancers found in resource poor settings.  PiGO has 35 members drawn from 3 schools and 18 departments of FHCRC, UW and Children's, and $4.5M  in peer-reviewed funding (direct dollars) in fiscal year 2013, of which $2.6M (49%) is from NCI.

The Core will also perform pre-clinical studies using our xenograft resources; and  4. An administrative program to obtain samples from minority patients, prioritize the distribution of specimens, conduct a quality control program, and to ensure patient confidentiality and compliance with IRB requirements.  The performance of each of the research projects detailed in this program project mandates that investigators have ready access to well documented clinical specimens and relevant biological models. The investigators directing the Biospecimen Core also make it a policy to provide excess prostate cancer  specimen resources to POI collaborators and to non-P01 investigators on a world-wide basis. Overall, the  Biospecimen Core is a critical component of this P01 program project."
"9187652","Project 1: Modeling the Interface between Non-invasive Imaging and Drug Distribution  SUMMARY  Dogma in clinical neuro-oncology holds that Gadolinium (Gd) contrast on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in  tumor regions confirms that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is locally compromised, and thus sufficient levels of  drug are being distributed within these tumor regions. However, drug distribution data indicate the importance  of the local microenvironmental heterogeneity and other physical factors that lead to differential distribution of  therapeutic agents relative to Gd contrast. Non-invasively acquired imaging features can provide a snapshot  of tumor microenvironment and ultimately a better understanding of drug distribution. The goal of this project is  to develop and validate a ?minimal? model that will capture intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity to predict  clinically relevant levels of drug distribution using routine imaging. In this project, we will use a combination of  patient data, GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass  spectroscopy imaging (MALDI-MSI), and stimulated raman spectroscopy (SRS) to quantify the differences in  drug distribution within and across tumors and, in doing so, develop a computational framework for predicting  the efficacy of BBB-penetrant and BBB-impenetrant drugs for the treatment of GBMs.  Our hypothesis is that mathematical models based on multiparametric high content imaging techniques will  predict spatially distinct drug distribution patterns in invasive primary and metastatic brain tumor models for  both small molecule and macromolecular therapeutics, and therefore be pivotal to predicting the in vivo  efficacy of targeted therapies. The aims of this project are: Aim 1 - build a computational framework that  quantitatively connects imaging features with differences in drug distribution within and across tumors and Aim  2 - build a computational framework that quantitatively connects differences in drug distribution with imageable  response within and across tumors. The first aim involves experiments to quantify differences in drug  distribution across tumors in a series of PDXs with MALDI MSI, physical tissue features with SRS,  development/calibration of imaging-driven models for drug distribution incorporating BBB permeability, and  extending our results to patients through a Phase 0 trial. The second aim involves experiments to investigate  treatment response using BLI imaging, development/calibration of models of treatment response connecting  drug distribution and tumor kinetics, and extending our results to patients by determining sub-cohorts of  patients most likely to respond to therapies. This project will provide a quantitative connection between imaging  features and drug distribution at levels sufficient to predict heterogeneous treatment response across patients.  The ultimate vision is to provide clinicians an accessible decision-making tool to help choose relevant targeted  therapies that will be tailored for an individual GBM patient."

"9107348","BIOINFORMATICS & HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA ANALYSIS SHARED RESOURCE  ABSTRACT  Recent years have seen enormous growth in the complexity and importance of high-dimensional data and the  specialized methods and skills required for its successful analysis and integration. To address this emerging  need, and to address previous critiques, the Bioinformatics and High-Dimensional Data Analysis Shared  Resource (Bioinformatics) was developed by consolidating informatics components that were previously  distributed in Biostatistics and three other shared resources, forming a data analysis-focused Resource with  broadened scope, enhanced expertise and expanded capabilities. The reorganized Resource provides state-of-  the-art informatics and data analysis for genomics, cheminformatics, image analysis and other complex  problems. Faculty Director Jeremy Edwards, PhD (CGEG) is a genomics and bioinformatics expert and co-  Directors Tudor Oprea, MD,PhD (CT) and Keith Lidke, PhD (TCBS) lead the cheminformatics and image  analysis components of the Resource, respectively. The reorganized Resource is now well positioned to promote  interdisciplinary research and to develop innovative and significant methodologies in cancer research. The  Resource works closely with the other Shared Resources that generate large, complex data sets and with the  faculty in the Biostatistics Shared Resource who provide complementary expertise. The Resource Directors  collaborate with users to design experiments, develop new methods for data analysis and interpretation, to  integrate therapeutic knowledge and to assist with grant writing and data processing for publications. The  Resource maintains its own specialized computational resources, appropriate databases and software for  accomplishing its diverse goals. It also works closely with UNMCC Research Programs to develop and integrate  new methodologies into research projects, and actively facilitates and disseminates information about new  approaches and data analysis techniques by maintaining an up-to-date web page, promoting training and  education related to high-dimensional data collection and analysis and by giving presentations at UNMCC  meetings and retreats. The UNM Cancer Center Research Administration (CCRA) manages the Resource, which  operates through a collaborative model. During the previous 5-yr project period, 16 UNMCC members from all 4  Research Programs used the bioinformatics component of the former Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared  Resource, resulting in a total of 10 publications (2 have pending PMCIDs). In the reporting year of July 2013 ?  June 2014, 16 UNMCC members were responsible for 100% of total Resource usage and were supported by 7  peer-reviewed grants. However, another 18 UNMCC members, supported by 14 more grants and responsible  for 18 additional peer-reviewed publications, were supported by bioinformatics components in 3 other shared  resources, which have now been consolidated. Consequently, the reorganized Bioinformatics and High-  Dimensional Data Analysis Shared Resource is projected to have dramatically increased use and importance  due to its enhanced capabilities and as more projects develop that involve Big Data."
"9149427","Biological Evaluation Shared Resource: Project Summary   Biology Shared Resource Group   In cancer biology, mouse models continue to play significant roles in studies of tumor invasion, metastasis  and malignant transformation, as well as in studies examining responses to therapy. Key advancements have  emerged in the development of animal models for cancer biology, including the advent of orthotopic models for  metastasis, transgenic animals that have developmental pathways to tumorigenesis, and state-of-the-art  immunocompromised strains. Transplanted human xenografts remain a primary tool for molecular discovery  and evaluation. Despite their flaws and shortcomings, xenograft mouse models have played a significant role  in cancer drug development in the past three decades, and mouse models will continue to be a foundation in  the war against cancer. At the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) where a vast pipeline of  potential new agents for diagnosing and treating cancer are emerging, researchers need a productive and  established facility for in vivo testing which can navigate the arena of murine cancer models. The mission of  the Biological Evaluation Shared Resource (BE-SR) is to provide expert guidance to investigators in grant  preparation, model selection and experimental design, and to perform toxicity testing and proof-of-concept  efficacy studies to advance their projects using in vivo testing. In addition to including cell line-based xenograft  testing in nude mice, the BE-SR, in its efforts to offer the latest technologies, is transitioning to the use of NSG  mice and towards the use of primary xenograft testing. The goal of the BE-SR is to provide high quality,  reproducible results that are a consequence of standardized procedures and protocols and of carefully  maintained implantable cell lines that are subjected to strict quality control measures both in vitro and in vivo.  This quality service will result in overall lower costs and higher data fidelity to the investigator through smaller  standard deviations, fewer experimental repeats to achieve statistical significance, and higher biologic  relevance through initial consultation and guidance."
"9108277","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Imaging plays a vital role in the research programs of many AECC members. The Analytical Imaging Facility (AIF) makes routine and complex imaging technologies available to the entire AECC community. Microscope technology ranges from traditional brightfield, to epi-fluorescence, to laser scanning confocal, to high resolution transmission and scanning electron microscopy including cryoEM of macromolecules in this truly comprehensive shared resource. This wide range of imaging modalities allows for the study of animal models of disease. Cells expressing or labeled with fluorescent reporter molecules may be imaged in the whole animal, whole organ, single cell or cell compartments. Live cells may be imaged in real time to monitor physiological processes. Photo-activatable fluorescence molecules may be manipulated by light for dynamic in vivo studies. Confocal microscopes and epi-fluorescence paired with deconvolution enables 3D imaging of fixed material or 4D imaging of live cells. Traditional ultrastructure analysis by transmission electron microscopy is expanded to 3D by electron tomography. The recent installation of a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) has expanded the facility's SEM capabilities to include automated large area mapping, 3D image reconstruction, x-ray microanalysis, correlative fluorescence and SEM imaging and imaging frozen hydrated samples. AIF staff assist users in experimental design, data collection, quantitative image analysis and presentation. New users are taught imaging techniques required for their specific research objective, while experienced users may customize any imaging station, utilizing the facility's large inventory of optics and accessories. The facility offers customized full service sample preparation for electron microscopy, to ensure quality control and to offer the widest range of techniques. The AIF staff has the expertise to prepare samples by methods that include chemical fixation, embedding in resin, ultrathin sectioning, immunogold labeling and negative staining. The facility offers a full range of low temperature techniques for electron microscopy including quick freezing by plunge, metal mirror or high pressure freezing. Frozen samples can undergo freeze-substitution, freeze fracture, rotary shadow or cryosectioning and are then imaged in the TEM or SEM at ambient or low temperature. The AIF provides support for the microscopy requirements of the Molecular Cytogenetics and Histopathology Shared Resources. Since the last CCSG review, important new additions of equipment, personnel and services have been made, which have substantially enhanced the imaging capabilities at AECC."
"9108279","SUMMARY (See instructions): The Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FACS-SR) provides AECC investigators with technologies required for fluorescence-based cell analysis and sorting. A broad range of research in a large proportion of AECC associated laboratories is supported by the FACS-SR, with connections to virtually all AECC programs and training activities. The instruments required for flow cytometry and cell sorting are intricate and expensive, making this a logical resource to provide through a centralized facility. In addition, cell sorting presents complex issues in biocontainment, requiring specialized laboratory space and highly trained personnel for proper management. The organization of these resources within the FACS-SR has proven to be an extremely efficient approach to creating a well supervised, quality controlled, cost effective and safe environment for FACS-based analysis and cell sorting. Since the last CCSG review in 2007, the FACS-SR has undergone major expansion to add new capabilities as well as a needed increase in the capacity for all services. Substantial additional laboratory space has been added, including rooms that are specially configured for enhanced BSL-2 work involved with sorting of primary human cells or potentially infectious material. Work performed to a great extent by AECC members has driven technology development in the FACS-SR, and supported multiple successful NIH Shared Instrumentation Grants over the past five years. This, along with substantial ongoing institutional support, has led to the acquisition of major new equipment and expansion of the resources and services provided by the FACS-SR. Three new cell sorters have been added to the facility since the last competing renewal, enabling accommodation of the growing need for this resource. Both Beckman-Coulter MoFlo and BD FACSAria sorters are operated by the facility, providing an extraordinarily advanced and versatile range of cell sorting applications. In addition, several analytical flow cytometers have been added to the facility's inventory, and facility staff has been increased to achieve maximum utilization of the instrumentation. The FACS-SR has also been highly successful at introducing novel technologies to AECC investigators in recent years, such as laser scanning cytometry and newly derived fluorescent proteins with unique spectral properties. The FACS-SR staff provides training on all the instruments, as well as consultation to assist with experimental design and instrument selection. A well established administrative structure ensures orderly management of facility operations and efficient delivery of services at the lowest possible cost."

Tissue from initial and all follow-up colonoscopies in the colonoscopy arm and tissues from any colonoscopies in the FIT arm would be available for research, which may allow us to develop a predictive model for the development of advanced neoplasia over time.    The goal of this IAA is to create a biorepository of blood and tissue from veterans enrolling in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?s Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) study, Colonoscopy vs. Fecal Immunochemical Test in Reducing Mortality from Colorectal Cancer (CONFIRM) trial. This biorepository would be a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies. Augmenting the rich clinical data being collected would allow us to use blood and tissue specimens from the biorepository for defining risk for colorectal neoplasia (including cancer and adenoma endpoints).  Specifically, these tissues including colorectal biopsies and blood samples would be stored at VA central biospecimen facility and could be used for developing algorithms for personalizing and targeting the approach to colorectal cancer screening and surveillance based on clinical, diagnostic (i.e. results of fecal immunochemical tests, or FIT), and genomic risk profiles. This approach would inform risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, allowing us to target efforts to those most likely to benefit.  The aims of this collaboration is to collect and store biospecimens for future studies with the overarching goal of personalized screening and surveillance strategies based on risk, reducing over screening or surveillance in lower risk groups, with subsequent potential reductions in cost and adverse events."
"9108272","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Experimental Therapeutics is the programmatic home for basic and clinical investigators involved in a broad spectrum of studies in cancer therapeutics. The goals of the program are: (1) to develop novel agents for the treatment of cancer based upon targets identified in this and other programs, (2) to improve the activities of established classes of drugs by structural modification and/or enhanced understanding of their pharmacological properties, (3) to develop more effective clinical therapeutic regimens within the context of disease-focused working groups. Preclinical drug development continues in the areas of transition-state inhibitors, novel microtubule-stabilizing agents, and a diverse spectrum of immunotherapeutics. Two transition-state inhibitors are now in clinical trials, one advanced. A third is moving forward to the clinic. A monoclonal antibody (moab) to melanin linked to 188-rhenium completed Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Other moab-radionuclides are being developed targeting cervical and pancreatic cancers. An agent for the prevention of the dermatitis due to EGFR inhibitors recently entered a Phase II clinical trial. The spectrum of agents studied has broadened to encompassing aptamers, high-affinity antibodies, agents to block apoptotic pathways or targeted to surface glycans. Research in biologicals is focused on co-inhibitory elements within the immune synapse with the objective of developing agents that modulate tolerance, research activities supported by the expanding capabilities in protein production, synthetic chemistry, x-ray crystallography, NMR, and mass spectroscopy with bioinformatics and systems and computational biology support. Disease-focused working groups encompassing basic and clinical investigators have been expanded in breast, gynecological, lung, and head/neck cancers and in the hematological malignancies. Neuro-oncology and neuroendocrine tumors groups were recently formed. Recruitment of clinical and translational researchers has been enhanced by a recently funded Paul Calabresi Career Development Award for Clinical Oncology Scholars. Access to patients for clinical trials has been enhanced at the affiliated Montefiore Medical Center by the creation of the multidisciplinary Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care and the recruitment of a cadre of clinician investigators. AECC members play important roles in ECOG-ATRIN, GOG, COG, and the AIDS Malignancy Consortium. There are currently 54 members from 23 departments, supported by 10 NCI grants ($2.6M Direct) and 21 other peer-reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($10.2M Direct).

"9105319","This PPG has documented the existence of a paracrine signaling loop between tumor cells and tumor-  associated macrophages (TAMs), in which reciprocal production of EGF and GSF-1 interact with cognate  receptors in each cell type to promote invasion and metastasis. Recently, we have uncovered a role for G-  protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation of PI S-kinase (PISK) in the macrophage-tumor cell paracrine  loop. We have generated extensive preliminary data implicating GPCR signaling and GPCR-dependent  PISKs in both arms of the paracrine loop (macrophage to tumor cell and tumor cell to macrophage). The  present proposal will examine the role of GPCR signaling in macrophage-tumor cell interactions. Aim 1 takes  advantage of novel mutants of the two GPCR-regulated PISKs, pHOy and p110(3, which are specifically  defective for activation by GPCRs. We will disrupt GPCR-mediated signaling in tumor cells and  macrophages by replacing endogenous pHOp/y with these mutants, and then evaluate paracrine signaling  between the cells using assays developed by this PPG: SD invasion, intravasation and extravasation in vitro,  and Invasion, experimental metastasis, and in vivo motility assays using intravital Imaging in animals. Aim 2  focuses on the PlSK-dependent phosphorylation of tumor cell Nonmuscle Myosin Heavy Chain-llA (NMHC-  llA) S194S, which promotes NMHC-llA disassembly and enhances macrophage-dependent tumor cell  invasion. We will directly test whether S194S phosphorylation in tumor cells is regulated by paracrine signals  from macrophages. We will express phosphorylation site mutants of NMHC-llA in tumor cells and  macrophages, and measure effects on invasion, Intravasation and extravasation in vitro and in vivo. We will  use breast tumor reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs) to determine If increased phospho-NMHC-IIA  correlates with metastatic progression in cancer patients, and we will use a high throughput siRNA kinase  screen to identify the kinases that directly regulate NMHC-llA phosphorylation in tumor cells. Finally, Aim 3 Is  based on data suggesting a role for PISKs and NMHC-llA in the reciprocal stimulation of chemokine  secretion by macrophages and tumor cells. We will test whether the expression of mutant PISKs and NMHC-  llA alters the secretion of chemokinetic factors by each cell, as well as the related process of MMP trafficking  to Invadopodia in tumor cells, and examine the mechanism for these secretory phenotypes. Overall, this  proposal will provide important new insights in GPCR regulation of macrophage-tumor cell interactions.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Therapeutic approaches targeting tumor metastasis are a critical priority in current cancer research. Previous  work from this program project has shown that interactions between tumor cells and surrounding tissue  profoundly influence tumor cell invasion and metastatic spread. This proposal provides new insights into the  molecular basis for these interactions, and may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets."

These activities  also help ensure that cancer patients served by the Consortium have opportunities to participate in studies  matching the types and stages of diseases that occur in this population. The PRMS ensures that cancer-  relevant human research is scientifically important, has a sound biostatistical foundation and supports the  research mission of the Consortium. The PRMS also ensures that research is designed appropriately  without excluding special populations for non-scientific reasons and is feasible, with reasonably attainable  accrual targets given the available patient population. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) has the  primary role in the PRMS. Members of the SRC have deep, multidisciplinary expertise, including medical  oncology, surgical oncology, radiation therapy, pediatrics, nursing, pathology, laboratory sciences, cancer  imaging, pharmacy and biostatistics. Portfolios of research protocols are organized and maintained by  defined Research Groups, each led by a senior faculty member. The SRC conducts an independent review  of all new protocols and has well-defined approval criteria designed to ensure that goals of the PRMS are  met. The SRC also reviews accrual and scientific progress for each study at 6-month intervals in order to  ensure efficient use of resources, using well-defined approval criteria for continued accrual. Allowances are  made for trials that focus on a rare disease or condition, those that are narrowly targeted, for investigator-  initiated trials that have outstanding scientific merit, and for multi-site trials that are making adequate overall  progress even if enrollment at the Consortium is low. The PRMS complements, but does not overlap with  the functions or role of the IRB, which functions independently and is focused on human subjects protection."

"9094430","This is a new SPORE project that evolved from a previously-funded SPORE Pilot project. The overall goal is to develop the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) pathway as a therapeutic target in lung cancers. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR and ALK have greatly impacted the treatment of lung cancers driven by oncogenic forms of these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Still, a large fraction of lung cancers, especially of non-adenocarcinoma histologies, have no identified driving oncogene and remain an important and unmet clinical need. Our studies have unveiled a role for an FGFR pathway as an oncogene driver in NSCLC cell lines of diverse histologies. FGFR-dependency occurs independently of gain-of-function mutations, although FGFR1 gene amplification and/or copy number gain have recently been described in squamous lung cancers. In addition, rare somatic mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 have been reported in lung cancers, although their potential as oncogene drivers has not been defined. FGFR1 gene copy number is being employed as a pre-selection marker in early phase trials of the FGFR-specific TKIs, AZD4547 and BGJ398. While we will further explore FGFR1 copy number gain, our preclinical findings reveal that other predictive biomarkers (FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression) may more accurately identify FGFR-dependent, and therefore FGFR-specific TKI sensitive, lung cancers. Specifically, we have shown that FGFR activity depends on expression of FGFR1 and co-expression of the ligands, FGF2 or FGF9, thereby establishing an autocrine mechanism to drive increased FGFR activity. We will test the hypothesis that an FGF-FGFR1 autocrine pathway serves as a frequent oncogenic driver across all histologies of lung cancers and that specific biomarkers beyond FGFR1 gene copy number will serve as predictive biomarkers of lung cancer patients likely to respond to FGFR-selective TKIs. To test this hypothesis, we will complete the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Define biomarkers that accurately identify the subset of lung cancers bearing activated FGFR pathways. Specific Aim 2: Use optimized biomarker selection strategies to conduct a phase II clinical trial with the FGFR-active TKI, ponatinib in lung cancer patients. Specific Aim 3: Identify mechanisms of acquired resistance to FGFR-specific TKIs. Successful completion of this project will exert high impact on overall lung cancer treatment by unveiling a novel and substantial subset of lung tumors that are not presently identifiable through simple mutation screening nor targetable by an approved therapeutic."
"9149423","DNA Sequencing Shared Resource:   Project Summary   Biology Shared Resource Group   The DNA Sequencing Shared Resource (SEQ-SR) is part of the campus-wide Purdue University Genomics  Facility that provides equal access to all Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) investigators.  Established in 1993, the SEQ-SR has provided PCCR members for the past 20 years with cost effective,  quality services. The services provided by the DNA Sequencing Shared Resource (SEQ-SR) supported 40  Purdue Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) investigators' research projects from all four of PCCR's Research  Programs in this current year. In addition to the standard DNA sample Sanger sequencing, the SEQ-SR is  developing and refining next-generation services that are critical to the research needs of PCCR members'  future research plans. Members rely on the SEQ-SR to sequence genes and various gene constructs, and  verify sequences containing `installed' mutations, among other uses. The low-throughput laboratory service  offered by the SEQ-SR facility additionally supports the Transgenic Mouse Core Facility Shared Resource  (TMCF-SR). Specifically, the SEQ-SR helps ensure that the targeting and other DNA containing constructs  that will be injected into rodents, are correct. Given the fairly low dollar cost of obtaining sequence data of a  few samples, it is important to assess all the costs involved to researchers in utilizing a service of this type by  convenience, rapid turn-around times, persistent data storage and availability of staff for consultation with the  investigator."
"9001930","Hematologic Malignancies Program  The goal of the Program in Hematologic Malignancies is to develop a better understanding and improved  treatments for this group of diseases. Four areas of focus predominate: (1) Developing a deeper understanding  of the biologic basis of hematologic malignancies; (2) Using this understanding to develop better non-  transplant therapies; (3) Discovering novel methods to overcome the current limitations of hematopoietic cell  transplantation; and (4) Using these discoveries to improve the actual practice of hematopoietic cell  transplantation. The Hematologic Malignancies program currently has 75 members from 11 departments and 3  institutions. Seventy-three Members (97%) have peer-reviewed funding or are the Principal Investigator on a  clinical trial. The Hematologic Malignancies program currently has $24.3M in grant funding (direct dollars) of  which $16.9M is peer-reviewed and $6.9M (40%) is from NCI. The Program published a total of 1218 papers in  the previous grant period. 27% were intra-programmatic, 35% were inter-programmatic and 19% were inter-  institutional. In 2012, 148,040 Americans were diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy, resulting in 54,380  deaths, making these malignancies collectively the second leading cause of cancer death after lung cancer  (160,340), and exceeding in aggregate the deaths from colon (51,690), breast (39,920) pancreas (37,390), and  prostate cancer (28,170). Previous work from our program has improved our understanding of this group of  diseases, particularly the myeloid malignancies, leading to new approaches to screening for genetic  abnormalities, improved monitoring of disease progression and novel therapeutics. Results from our studies  have also led to a better understanding of the science behind problems of hematopoietic cell transplantation  and provided methods to overcome some of these problems leading to improved cure rates. Members of this  program also oversee a very busy clinical service, caring for 802 new patients in 2013 alone, of which 466  (58%) were treated on clinical trials."
"9001932","Prostate Cancer Program  The Prostate Cancer Program (PCP) aims to advance and exploit scientific knowledge that will reduce the  morbidity and mortality attributed to prostate cancer and lead to improvements in patients' quality of life. The  PCP has three primary areas of focus where cooperative efforts (allocation of resources; faculty recruitments;  scientific collaborations) are coordinated to make substantive advancements: 1) understanding the heritable  and environmental risk factors contributing to prostate cancer development, progression, and lethality; 2)  targeting mechanisms contributing to castration-resistant prostate cancer progression; and, 3) distinguishing  lethal from indolent prostate cancer through discovery and validation of prognostic biomarkers and a treatment  plan that affords longitudinal assessments and attenuation of risk. The P30 CCSG supports this research  program by providing: key shared resources, particularly Comparative Medicine, Specimen Processing,  Genomics, and Research Pathology; administrative and logistical support for PCP meetings, pilot funding for  new clinical and translational research projects, and recruitment grants for new faculty.  The Prostate Cancer Program currently has 32 members from 3 schools/divisions, 10 departments and 2  institutions. Eight members have primary appointments at FHCRC and 24 at UW. 29 Members (90%) have  peer-reviewed funding, are PI on a clinical trial, or are newly recruited and supported by institutional funds.  The current research support of PCP members comprises $6.5M in peer-reviewed funding of which $4.4M  (68%) is from the NCI (direct dollars.)

"9149753","ABSTRACT ? PLANNING AND EVALUATION  The goal of SBMRI Cancer Center's planning process is to strategize and prioritize programmatic  development, intra- and inter-programmatic activities, and Center-wide activities to enable the Center to fulfill  its vision of making paradigm-shifting discoveries that will underlie novel therapeutic modalities by creating,  translating, and disseminating exceptional cancer basic science. To this end SBMRI Cancer Center has  established a coordinated and multilayered planning and evaluation process. The de facto Cancer Center  Executive Committee is the Cancer Center Leadership Team (CCLT) chaired by the Center Director and  comprising the Deputy Director, the three Associate Directors (Shared Resources, Education and Mentoring,  and Administration), and the three Program Leaders, who provide scientific guidance, direction, and advice to  the Center Director. The CCLT receives input from the Shared Resources Team chaired by the Associate  Director for Shared Resources, and the Administrative Team chaired by the Associate Director for  Administration. Advice on programmatic and thematic development, recruitment, and funding of pilot projects is  solicited from the Cancer Center External Advisory Board (EAB) through an annual meeting and on an as-  needed basis. The Cancer Center Internal Scientific Advisory Committee (IAC) performs 6-monthly evaluations  of the Cancer Center's scientific direction and achievements. Review showed that the goals of the 2009  SBMRI Cancer Center 5-year Strategic Plan were fully achieved in terms of recruitment (9 new faculty),  including Dr. Powis as Cancer Center Director; reorganization from 4 to 3 programs; a new developing Shared  Resource, Cancer Metabolism; and 18 pilot grant awards. A new Cancer Center 5-year Strategic Plan was  developed at a retreat attended by nearly all Center members in December 2013, which established future  scientific direction for the Programs and target areas for the recruitment. The new Strategic Plan is a shared-  governance document that combines bottom-up input from the SBMRI Cancer Center faculty with elements of  top-down planning by the Cancer Center Director and CCLT, and is in accordance with SBMRI's institutional  10-year vision of building on institutional existing strengths in research discovery (new targets) and early small  molecule lead discovery (therapeutics). The CCLT holds monthly meetings at which, among other activities, it  evaluates the Center's progress in achieving goals established by the 5-year Strategic Plan in areas including  education, team science, and minority representation. Future growth areas identified by the Strategic Plan are  cancer metabolism and stress, tumor dormancy and resistance, and epigenomics, while needed resources  were identified as greater access to clinical samples, more bioinformatics, and support for PDX models.  Progress toward providing for these needs has begun, particularly access to human tissues and PDX mouse  models. 10 recruitments, mostly junior faculty, are planned in the next grant period, with several recruitments  already underway for the coming year, in many cases as joint recruitments by two or more Programs."

"9129460","Acknowledging the critique from the last CCSG competitive renewal, the IUSCC has made the increase of the depth of clinical and translational studies at IUSCC part of its ongoing strategic plan. To achieve this goal, we have leveraged Project Management resources through the IUSCC Translational Research Acceleration Collaboration (ITRAC) to coordinate translational projects and cultivate a more robust translational/clinical research portfolio. The project management initiative under the guidance of the Associate Director (AD) of Clinical Research, Dr. Sherif Farag and the AD of Basic Science Research, Dr. Mark Kelley facilitates collaborations by removing traditional barriers between bench and clinical research, and aids in identifying funding resource options (more information on the ITRAC initiative is in section 7.4 Developmental Funds).    The Clinical Research Office (CRO) protocol development service team works closely with the ITRAC Project Management team during study design to promote and assist with interdisciplinary connections/collaborations among investigators.

"9143720","Poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer is due in part to poor response to the current standard of care  (gemcitabine, a cytidine nucloeside analog). Our preliminary data establish a novel, widely-prevalent  mechanism of resistance to fluoropyrimidines whereby the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor1 (HIF1) alpha-induced  glycolytic flux leads to a corresponding increase in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway to enhance the  intrinsic levels of cytidine. Such increased levels of cytidine/dCTP diminish the effective levels of gemcitabine  and 5FU (in FOLFIRINOX) through molecular competition or dilution. Our data also indicate existance of a  bidirectional tumor-stromal metabolite flux that may facilitate tumor/stromal cell survival under low nutrient  conditions, promote desmoplasia, increase metabolite flux into pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, and result in  decreased chemotherapy sensitivity. Thus, we propose to determine if combining gemcitabine/FOLFIRINOX  therapies with digoxin (to target HIF1 alpha) or Leflunomide (to target pyrimidine biosynthesis) will diminish  fluoropyrimidine therapy resistance in pancreatic cancer patients (AIM 1). Additionally, we will employ 18FFDG-  PET imaging in pancreatic cancer patients to predict the resistance status of the tumor against  pyrimidine analogs (AIM1). We will also investigate if cytidine levels in pancreatic tumors/biofluids may serve  as potential biomarkers for chemotherapy responsiveness in pancreatic cancer patients (AIM2).  Furthermore, we will investigate if tumor-stromal metabolite exchange facilitates stromal cell survival and  desmoplasia in tumor models, and increased pyrimidine biosynthesis and diminished gemcitabine  responsiveness in tumor cells (AIM3). We predict that our proposed improvement to current chemotherapy  strategies will improve survival in pancreatic cancer patients by increasing the efficacy and/or decreasing the  toxicity, by requiring smaller doses, of chemotherapy strategies that employ gemcitabine and/or 5FU."
"9125767","Project 1 is designed to improve upon the outcome of anti-angiogenic therapy in glioblastoma. The Food  and Drug Administration approved bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, as monotherapy for  recurrent glioblastoma in 2009. However, the precise mechanism(s) of action of this drug in glioblastoma is  not fully understood. Previously, we showed that blocking VEGF-signaling with DC101, a murine anti-VEGF  antibody, or AZD2171, a pan-VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, normalizes glioblastoma blood vessels and  increases overall survival in animal models. However, the effects of anti-VEGF therapies on overall survival  appear modest in glioblastoma patients as the tumor eventually escapes from normalization by the up  regulation of other pro-angiogenic signal transduction pathways. One pro-angiogenic molecule of particular  interest in this regard is angiopoietin-2 (Ang2). We have demonstrated that overexpression of Ang2  compromises the survival benefit from DC101 treatment. Moreover, Ang2 expression decreased during the  vascular normalization window but increased as the tumor vessels began to become abnormal. This pattern  of dynamic Ang2 expression has also been observed in the plasma of recurrent glioblastoma patients treated  with AZD2171. Based on these pre-clinical and clinical data, we hypothesize that the inhibition of Ang2 may  prolong the normalization window, thereby improving the clinical benefit induced by VEGF-blockade. We wiil  test whether blocking both Ang2 and VEGF signaling in different schedules inhibits tumor growrth and  increases overall survival in different murine glioblastoma models (Aim One). Subsequently, we will test  whether blocking both of these pathways can increase survival by prolonging the normalization window over  that pbserved with VEGF inhibition alone (Aim Two). Finally, we will conduct a clinical trial (Aim Three) that  will assess the impact of selective Ang2 inhibition on the vascular normalization window in recurrent  glioblastoma patients as well as the safety and potential efficacy of anti-Ang2 therapy. This clinical trial will  provide the foundation for future combination trials of Ang2 and VEGF inhibitors, the latter informed by the  results of Aims One and Two."

"9120320","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Cancer Control and Population Health (CCPH) program is a relatively new program within the Kansas University Cancer Center, developed explicitly to identify better ways to bring cancer control efforts into high risk and underserved communities. The CCPH program is co-led by Edward F. Ellerbeck, MD, MPH and Kimberly K. Engelman, PhD and brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers focused on 1) advancing the science of working with underserved communities in efforts to improve cancer control and reduce cancer-related health disparities; 2) identifying new strategies to improve smoking cessation and enhance the delivery of effective smoking cessation services; and 3) developing and testing novel methods to improve the delivery and uptake of effective cancer screening services. Since the creation of the CCPH, program members have made remarkable progress in developing the infrastructure to conduct cancer control research in underserved, regional rural, American Indian, African American, and Latino communities. Paralleling this growth in infrastructure has been a rapid growth in cancer control funding and an increase in program membership. CCPH program activities support both intra- and inter-programmatic interactions through translational research seminars, a visiting scholars program, research symposia, and research interest groups. A strong mentoring program has helped junior faculty procure training grants and minority supplements. CCPH research efforts have led to new discoveries related to the treatment of African American light smokers and the integration of smoking cessation efforts into rural primary care. Applying community based participatory research methods, CCPH researchers developed the first culturally tailored smoking cessation program designed for a heterogeneous American Indian community. The community-based research in the CCPH is strongly supported by a vibrant rural practice-based research network, the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, and the Latino Health Initiatives Network. This support has allowed CCPH members to enroll more than 10,000 people from underserved communities into cancer control research studies over the past 5 years. The 23 members of the CCPH program come from 5 departments in 2 schools. Although many members are new to cancer control research, they represent a rich mix of expertise, including psychologists, sociologists, neuroscientists, primary care physicians, oncologists, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, anthropologists, economists, pharmacists, communication specialists, and health services researchers. Program members are supported by $11.5 million in total annual funds, including $3.6 million from the National Cancer Institute. CCPH members have published 131 articles since 2006 of which 53 (40%) were intra-programmatic and 38 (29%) were inter-programmatic.

In its current configuration, the BISR brings together multiple units at the AECC and the College to focus on the bioinformatics needs of investigators that utilize a variety of high-throughput genomic and epigenomic platforms, in particular massively-parallel sequencing, in their research. The components of the Bioinformatics Shared Resource include: (1) High-performance computing which was developed to meet the storage and processing needs of investigators based upon the sizes and complexities of data sets generated. High-performance computing has dedicated systems administrators, supporting relational database services and specialized high-performance computing resources, (ii) Computational genomics, (iii) The novel Wasp System software developed to receive, process, and provide initial analyses and presentation of data. Wasp has been designed not only to meet the data management needs of massively parallel sequencing but has been built with the flexibility that will allow adaptation to other types of datasets as they emerge in the future. The Bioinformatics Shared Resource works with Clinical Research Informatics to ensure that molecular data are fully interoperable with those of other AECC shared facilities, creating a virtual database integrating these disparate sources of information for analysis by biostatisticians and others. Clinical Research Informatics also addresses the increasing emphasis on clinical/translational studies by facilitating the development of effective, secure linkages with Montefiore Medical Center clinical data."
"9187678","PROJECT 2 ? SUMMARY  Project 2 of the proposed Center for Immunotherapeutic Transport Oncophysics (CITO) will focus on the  determination of immune-related transport differentials in subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  (PDAC). PDAC is considered to be a non-T cell inflamed tumor, and current immunotherapy strategies have  limited efficacy in treating PDAC. Biologically, the intense immune suppression of PDAC occurs due to the  presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and M2 macrophages in the  tumor microenvironment. While tremendous effort has focused on the biological pathways that regulate these  immunosuppressive cells so that more effector T cells can infiltrate and kill cancer cells, an area that has not  gained any significant attention is the contribution of multi-scale physical aberrations that are inherent in PDAC.  We believe that immunotherapy response and resistance in primary and metastatic sites are dependent on both  the molecular biology and heterogeneous multi-scale physical properties of a particular PDAC tumor. These  issues will be examined with the support of the Transport Oncophysics Core (TOC). We hypothesize that the  efficacy of immunotherapy is limited by the spatial distribution of nutrients in the tumor microenvironment, as its  disorganization restricts access of effector T cells to the cancer cells. A common feature of PDAC is an acidic  microenvironment that is rich in lactate, and extracellular lactate is known to inhibit T cells because they are  dependent on glycolysis. Our group has shown that vascular, stromal and membrane transport processes work  in concert to determine drug distribution in PDAC. We have now extended this concept to immune cell  biodistribution, and our preliminary data support the hypothesis that conservation laws of mass transport can  describe the spatial location of immune infiltrates in relation to cancer cells in human PDAC. We have also  developed biomimetic probes to study these phenomena in more detail and to develop novel immune-based  therapies. Moreover, we have identified biophysical subtypes of PDAC, which exhibit distinct physical and  immune properties, suggesting they will have differential responses to immunotherapies. We will couple these  preliminary data with a well-characterized immune checkpoint: phosphatidylserine (PS). PS functions upstream  of other immune checkpoints such as PD1 and CTLA4. Cells in the tumor microenvironment express PS, which  is recognized and bound by PS receptors on immune cells to induce and maintain immune suppression. PS-  targeting agents induce immune activation of innate and adaptive anti-tumor activity. We hypothesize that PS  contributes to PDAC immune evasion in concert with the aberrant physics of PDAC, and that PS inhibition will  normalize the biological and physical immunosuppression of PDAC. Our ultimate objective is to develop new  ways to non-invasively measure and modulate the immunosuppression of PDAC to improve outcomes for this  deadly disease."

"9105321","The aim of Core A is to provide the technology necessary to image breast cancer progression and  tumor cell dissemination and metastatic seeding in the most biologically relevant manner possible,  ensuring that imaged events are truly in vivo, match natural biology and are not artifacts of the imaging  method. The aim of Core A is to combine this capability with the collection and identification of  migratory cells in the primary tumor using the in vivo invasion assay. This has required a  comprehensive multiphoton- intravital approach with noninvasive optical technology (no stick or endoscope  probes) that can reliability capture cell behavior in deep undisturbed tissue (10-100 cell diameters deep) with  high temporal and spatial sensitivity and fidelity, but also with good preservation of viability of cells being  imaged. These requirements preclude the use of confocal microscopes which image only the most  superficial layer of cells (one cell deep) and have significant photo-toxicity. The multiphoton technology we  developed has included imaging strategies designed to expand the spectral range and number of fluorescent  proteins that may be simultaneously imaged and has been used to characterize novel fluorescent proteins.  Our custom built microscope systems employ broadly tunable (optical parametric) laser sources required for  multispectral photo-conversion. An important application arising from this development work is the use of  photo-conversion fate mapping of single cells in live mice.  Hence, Core A will provide the following services:  1) Intravital Imaging at single cell resolution in vivo and with the mammary imaging window.  2) Photo-conversion for phenotype analysis and correlated FACs recovery of cells in vivo.  3) Intravital Imaging of intravasation TEM and extravasation TEM in vivo and the corresponding TEM  assays in vitro.  4) Ex vivo whole lung imaging and cell fate mapping.  5) In vivo invasion assay cell collection and typing.   Core A Is essential to the overall goals of the program project since the behaviors and interactions of  tumor cells and stromal cells must be defined at high resolution in vivo in mice for all of the projects.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Without the services provided by Core A, the primary and secondary tumors would be treated as black  boxes, and all measures of invasion and metastasis would be relegated to indirect and/or end stage assays  (e.g. histology of dead tissue) which do not give information about mechanism or behavior at the single cell  level(19). The multiphoton microscope developed in Core A is the result of collaborations of the investigators  of this PPG, and its capabilities, including real-time single-cell fate mapping in live mice using photo-  conversion, are unique."
"9187675","ADMINISTRATIVE CORE ? SUMMARY  The proposed Center for Immunotherapeutic Transport Oncophysics (CITO) is focused on identifying and  understanding the multi-scale transport properties of immune cells and molecules, both systemically and  within the tumor microenvironment, and other specific biological and physical properties of the tumor  microenvironment, to ultimately develop effective cancer immunotherapies. The major CITO components  are summarized as follows. Project 1 proposes to determine the transport phenomena of dendritic cell (DC)  vaccines for breast and pancreatic cancers and post-vaccination changes in the transport of endogenous DCs,  effector T cells, and macromolecular drugs. This information will be used to improve immune responses in  these two cancer models. Project 2 seeks to determine the effects of multi-scale transport phenomena of  pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) on the distribution of immune cells and nutrients in the tumor  microenvironment, during tumor progression. The Transport Oncophysics Core (TOC) will support both  projects with modeling, computational, and imaging capabilities to integrate the scientific data into parameters  that ultimately inform the rational design of optimal cancer immunotherapeutics and to improve the  immunogenicity of breast and pancreatic cancers, both of which are historically known to be lowly  immunogenic. The Education and Outreach Unit (EOU) will serve as the communication and engagement  platform for students, trainees, junior faculty investigators, and researchers of the CITO, and those of the  Physical Sciences-Oncology Network (PS-ON) and beyond. The Administrative Core (AC) will be established  as part of the CITO infrastructure through which the Principal Investigator (PI), Project Co-Leaders and Core  Leader, researchers, trainees, advisors, NCI PS-ON program staff, and other scientific and patient  communities can share information and synergize CITO-related activities. The AC will facilitate the  accomplishment and evaluation of progress and the creation of a collaborative network for current and future  scientists in physical sciences oncology. The AC will also oversee and manage the selection and funding of  Pilot and Trans-Network Projects, coordinate the use of shared resources and facilities, and promote  interaction with other PS-ON investigators. Dr. Mauro Ferrari (Center PI, senior physical sciences investigator,  AC Co-Leader, TOC Leader; Houston Methodist Research Institute, HMRI) will serve as the AC Co-Leader  (10% effort). Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf (Center cancer clinical translation investigator; AC Co-Leader; Project 1  Co-Leader; MD Anderson Cancer Center), Dr. Rongfu Wang (Center senior cancer immunology investigator;  AC Co-Leader; Project 1 Co-Leader; HMRI), and Dr. Rolf Brekken (senior cancer biology investigator; AC Co-  Leader; Project 2 Co-Leader; UT Southwestern Medical Center) will also serve as the other three AC Co-  Leaders (5% effort each in the AC). They will be supported by a Center Administrator and staff."
"9124861","Bladder cancer (BC) is among the most common cancers in the Western world. Because high-grade invasive  bladder cancers (HGIBC) can progress to life threatening metastases, understanding the molecular  mechanisms underlying BC Invasion is of tremendous Importance for reducing the mortality of this disease.  The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a member ofthe inhibitors of apoptosis protein (lAP)  family. In addition to its well-established role in apoptosis inhibition, we recently discovered a new role of  XIAP in regulating cancer cell Invasion in vitro. First, knockout of XIAP decreased colon cancer cell migration  and invasion in vitro and metastasis of these cells to the lungs in vivo. Conversely, resumption of XIAP  expression in XIAP-depleted cancer cells restored their migration. Second, Rho dissociation Inhibitor  (RhoGDI) is a principal downstream target of XIAP in regulating cancer cell migration. XIAP Interacted with  RhoGDI and in so doing inhibited RhoGDI SUMOylation via its RING domain. Third, XIAP was highly  expressed in human invasive BC tissues, but not in adjacent normal urothelial tissues. XIAP expression was  also markedly elevated in N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)-lnduced invasive BC tissues in p53-  l-lpRb-l- mice, while it was almost undetectable in wild-type mouse urothelia and was low in oncogenic Ras-  induced low-grade BCs. Fourth, knockdown of XIAP led to a marked decrease of HGIBC cell migration.  Finally, XIAP was significantly up-regulated in the cells harboring p53 mutations, a genetic alteration highly  prevalent in HGIBC. Our data from cell culture, transgenic mice and human tissues, demonstrating XIAP  over-expression in the invasive BCs, prompt us to hypothesize that XIAP plays an important role in  promoting/enhancing BC invasion. We will examine this hypothesis with three Specific Aims: 1: To test  the hypothesis that p53 mutations activate XIAP expression via the upregulation of Spl and/or NFKB in BC  cells; 2: To define the functional domain and molecular mechanisms whereby XIAP regulates BC cell  invasion; 3: To examine the hypothesis that urothelium-specific over-expression of XIAP in transgenic mice  can promote BC Invasion in vivo and that loss of XIAP in knockout mice or its RING domain in XIAPARNG  knockin mice renders these mice resistant to invasive BC development. Our proposed studies will contribute  in a major way to the understanding of the molecular basis of invasive BC. They will also pave the way for us  to use XIAP as a novel prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for invasive BC. This should in turn  help improve the clinical outcome of these patients.  RELEVANCE (See instmctions):  Although the invasive form of bladder cancer (BC) is responsible for all the deaths resulting from this  disease, little is known biologically about what triggers BC invasion. We recently found a new role of XIAP  previously known as an inhibitor of apoptosis, in cell migration and invasion. By studying the mechanisms  leading to increased XIAP in BC cells and the role of XIAP in BC invasion using mouse models, we hope to  determine whether XIAP can be used a prognostic marker and/or a therapeutic target of Invasive BC."

"9107356","PROTOCOL REVIEW & MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)  ABSTRACT  The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) at the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC)  is an essential component of the clinical research performed at the UNMCC. The PRMS provides a fully  integrated clinical research management system for cancer clinical trials at UNMCC and community studies  throughout New Mexico, which includes medical and scientific review and a single statewide cancer IRB  submission process with cooperating legal agreements between participating institutions. Since 2002, the New  Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA) created by Cheryl L. Willman, MD, Director and CEO of the UNMCC,  along with two community-based physicians and two New Mexico community health care systems, has  successfully functioned as a statewide cancer clinical trials organization and clinical research network which has  grown to include 5 community-based healthcare systems and the majority of oncologists statewide. The NMCCA  is physically housed in the UNMCC and its oversight and management is under the auspices of the UNMCC  Clinical Research Office. The PRMS supports this unique clinical research network that was developed in the  State of New Mexico, and is scientifically driven by UNMCC. PRMS represents a key structure at UNMCC to  prioritize and implement clinical research based on our scientific missions, developed through our Research  Programs and activated at UNMCC as well through the NMCCA and the UNMCC consortium partners. With the  unique structure to deliver clinical research to the entire State of New Mexico through the UNMCC's statewide  cancer clinical trials network, NMCCA, the UNMCC PRMS is the State's PRMS. The PRMS is led by Teresa  Rutledge, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Gynecologic  Oncology. In 2014, Dr. Rutledge was awarded the NCI Cancer Clinical Investigator Team Leadership Award.  During the previous funding period (2010 to 6/1/2014), the PRMS reviewed and prioritized 338 clinical research  studies; of the trials reviewed and prioritized 46% were NCI studies, 15% were investigator initiated and 38%  were industry sponsored. In 2013, a total of 79 protocols were submitted to the Clinical Working Groups for  review; the Working Groups declined 20 of these studies and 5 were withdrawn. There were 67 protocols  submitted for scientific review to the PRMC in calendar year 2013; 3 were declined by the PRMC. Of the studies  closed from January 2013 to June 30, 2014, 9 were investigator-initiated studies that were completed, 4 were  closed due to low accrual rates, 1 was closed due to toxicity, and 2 were closed due to lack of efficacy."
"9148033","Project Summary/Abstract  The first genomic landscape study of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) found a high  frequency of mutation and/or deletion of TP53 (>50% of mCRPC patients) relative to primary prostate cancers  (<5%). Changes in androgen receptor (AR), PTEN, and RB seen in other profiling efforts were also observed.  We have recently found that TP53 loss, particularly in combination with RB pathway dysfunction, confers  resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer cell line and xenograft models. Remarkably, this resistance  occurs in the absence of restored AR pathway signaling. Instead, these drug-resistant cells display reduced  expression of luminal epithelial markers (CK8, NKX3.1, AR) and acquire expression of basal epithelial and  neuroendocrine markers (CK5, p63, synaptophysin). This profile of lineage plasticity is heterogeneous across  the population of cells with TP53 and RB loss and reversible upon restoration of TP53 function. Similar to the  well-documented effects of TP53 and RB disruption in enhancing the efficiency of generating induced  pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from fibroblasts using ?Yamanaka? transcription factors, we postulate that loss of  TP53/RB pathway function creates a state of increased plasticity that allows luminal prostate cancer cells to  escape the growth suppressive effects of castration therapy by assuming characteristics of basal epithelial or  neuroendocrine cells which no longer depend on AR signaling for growth. Parallel studies of CRPC patients,  using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from phlebotomy samples obtained from men prior to a change in  systemic therapy in the 1st, 2nd and/or 3rd line setting, reveal quantifiable differences in morphological and  molecular tumor heterogeneity within the same patient. Using the validated Epic platform, which enables serial  characterization of multiple phenotypic and molecular features including morphology, protein expression, and  genotype, we developed a measure of CTC heterogeneity within an individual patient that reveals some  patients to have primarily clonal, homogeneous CTCs and others to have a markedly heterogeneous collection  of CTCs. Our preliminary results show that a high CTC heterogeneity index is correlated with worse treatment  response to AR-targeted drugs (abiraterone, enzalutamide) but not to taxanes (docetaxel, cabazitaxel). The  primary goal of this project will leverage our finding, from preclinical prostate model systems, that TP53 and RB  loss promote a state of epithelial lineage plasticity and resistance to AR therapy, in order to ask if TP53 and RB  are molecular determinants of the high CTC heterogeneity observed in patients. The combination of  mechanistic (Aim 1) and correlative clinical (Aim 2) studies in this project is designed to enable development of  biomarkers that identify patients destined for a poor response to AR-targeted therapies."
"9149764","5.10 Abstract - CANCER METABOLISM (Core Group B)  Cancer Metabolism (Core Group B) has been a developing Shared Resource in the Cancer Center for almost  two years, and is now proposed as a full-fledged Cancer Center Shared Resource. In 2009, a cancer  metabolism-focused Program Project grant led by Dr. Ze'ev Ronai, nucleated academic focus on cancer  metabolism, and expanding this area of cancer research was part of the Center's 2009 strategic plan. Growing  interest in metabolism among Cancer Center faculty, along with recruitment of new faculty interested in the link  between cancer and metabolism, drove the Center to develop technical resources to support and enhance  such analysis. Initial technology development began with the Institute-funded purchase of a Shimadzu QP2010  GC/MS in 2009. By 2012, Cancer Center efforts to more broadly provide and coordinate technology support in  metabolic analysis led to creating a Developing Shared Resource. The first step was to hire Dr. Adam  Richardson on a part-time basis, to initiate a Cancer Metabolism Core. Primarily through Institutional support,  the developing Core acquired additional instrumentation: a YSI 7100 media analyzer, a Shimadzu Prominence  HPLC, and a Seahorse XF24. With this set of tools along with staff expertise, the developing Shared Resource  is able to provide a wide range of metabolic analyses to Cancer Center scientists, including stable isotope  tracking of metabolic flux by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), measuring the abundances of  specific metabolites by either GC/MS or LC/MS, observing metabolite exchange with the media using either  GC/MS or the YSI 7100, and determining the cellular bioenergetics program via HPLC. The Resource also  added Dr. David Scott on a part-time basis, to maintain the GC/MS and develop new GC/MS methodology. As  the Core grew in scope and usage, Dr. Richardson moved to a full time position as Director of the developing  Core in 2013 and a part-time technician was hired in 2014. In the past year, 13 Cancer Center groups have  used the Core, and several high-profile publications have already been supported by the Core. The scientific  focus of the Core is to investigate the role of metabolism in cancer and its microenvironment both at the  cellular and at an organismal level, combining in vitro and in vivo analysis. Although interest in cancer  metabolism is rapidly growing, both in the Cancer Center and in cancer research in general, many of the  techniques and methodologies of the field are new to cancer biologists. As such, the Shared Resource places  a strong emphasis on evaluating new projects and assisting Center researchers in planning the proper  approaches and experiments. The Core staff works with Center investigators to design the appropriate  experiments, educate and train laboratory scientists, and assist with data analysis and follow-up experiments.  Such assistance includes guiding investigators new to metabolic analysis, as well as technically supporting  experts in this area. Overall, the Core's technology and expertise in measuring metabolic changes in cancer,  supports a rapidly growing field of research in the Center and a focal point in the Center's strategic plan."

This center-wide activity is overseen by an inter-programmatic Internal Advisory Board (I AB), under the recent supervision of Andrew K. Godwin within the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. The BSR has three major functions: 1) identify participants, administer informed consent, collect tissue, blood, and/or urine samples from selected populations, and obtain information on personal and family histories of cancer, clinical intervention, and lifestyle factors for use in research; 2) process and house human biospecimens obtained through investigator-initiated studies; and 3) provide expert histology technical procedures and pathological evaluation of tissue samples. Working in collaboration with pathologists, medical oncologists, surgeons and other hospital personnel, specially trained staff obtain patient consent, collect samples and assemble comprehensive clinical information about each donor and the corresponding samples. As part of this banking the BSR staff provides i) outstanding diagnostic pathology support; ii) a comprehensive informed consent process for the use of tissue, blood, and/or urine from patients and participants for research; iii) a specialized biospecimen bank devoted to the collection and distribution of specimens to support research; iv) extensive supporting data from the clinical record and self-reported health history of each participant, and v) fixation, paraffin processing, slide preparation and routine staining, immunohistochemistry support, tissue microarray, image analysis and digital pathology.

"9124859","Bladder cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease entity exhibiting divergent phenotype, biological behavior  and clinical outcome. About 70% of BC present as low-grade, superficial papillary tumors that are frequently  recurrent but infrequently progress to high-grade muscle-invasive stages. The rest (~30%) of BC are high-grade  and invasive at presentation, and they usually do have a prior history of low-grade, papillary tumors  but are believed to arise de novo or derive from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ lesions. Whether these two  major phenotypic variants of BC are caused by distinct molecular alterations is of central importance in  understanding and effectively managing BC. However, answer to this question remains elusive due to the  lack of concerted research efforts. Over the past 15 years, we have been dissecting the molecular  mechanisms of BC pathways by developing and analyzing genetically engineered mice via urothelium-specific  gene activation or ablation or both. The resulting mouse models not only recapitulate many salient  features of human BC, but yield new information regarding the cause-effect relationship between genes and  pathways. The present proposal is designed to gain much deeper and broader insights into the combinatorial  molecular events that together serve as the drivers to trigger BC formation along the two major phenotypic  pathways. Aim 1 will define the molecular alterations that are capable of synergizing with mutated fibroblast  growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) to initiate low-grade, superficial papillary BC. This Aim will focus on (i) the  deficiency of pi 51 NK4b, p16lNK4a and p19ARF, three tumor suppressors located on 9p21 and frequently  deleted in early-stage human BC; and (ii) the increased signaling of mutated FGFR3 through FGF signaling.  Aim 2 will examine the effects of gain-of-function p53 mutations and those in collaboration with pRb family  deficiency in triggering high-grade invasive BC. A combination of cell culture, genetically engineered models  and human studies will be used to accomplish the objectives. Collectively, these studies should help define  the molecular drivers that are responsible for urothelial tumorigenesis along divergent pathways and help  devise new biomarker panels for improved diagnosis, prognosis prediction and novel therapies of BC."

"9000108","Developmental funds have been used for two purposes during the last grant cycle and we propose to  continue funding in these areas in the next grant cycle.  1) Pilot Funds - The CCSG developmental funds support three types of pilot grants, each targeting a  different Cancer Center member group:  ? Push grants - to accelerate (or push) the pace of effort on cancer-focused research initiatives  judged to have a high potential to lead to peer-reviewed funding within 1 -2 years.  ? Pull grants - to encourage cancer research among non-cancer members and new members, i.e. to  puir them into the Cancer Center.  ? Paff/7er grants - to encourage clinicians to partner with a basic or population scientist in a joint  project in translational research. Partner grants require matching funds from the clinical department.  These pilot grants have yielded a return of investment of about 14 fold over the past five years. We plan  to continue using these pilot project mechanisms in the next grant cycle.  2) Shared Resource Development - We have used CCSG developmental funds from the past grant  cycle to support our Crystallography and Computational Biosciences (CCB) shared resource.

"9001910","Developmental Funds - Project Summary  Developmental funds play several critical roles in furthering the Consortium's strategic objectives. Several  outstanding investigators who received recruitment funds during the project period would not have come to  Seattle without the extra support that was offered through the availability of CCSG new investigator funds. The  availability of CCSG pilot project funding provides investigators a very tangible benefit of cancer center  membership, and, as described later in this section, has stimulated new collaborations that would otherwise  not have occurred. And, funds to catalyze new shared resource development have afforded Consortium  members access to technologies and expertise that would otherwise not be sustainable on an individual  laboratory or even in many cases an institutional basis.  During the past grant period, developmental funds supported the recruitment of 28 productive Consortium  faculty members in areas of strategic growth; 47 pilot projects resulting in the acquisition of 26 grants and the  publication of 32 papers; and four developing shared resources for Bioinformatics, Tissue Bank, Tumor  Models, and High Throughput Screening. In this application, developmental funds are requested for these  three types of high impact activities as well as two Special Populations Staff Investigators. Clearly defined,  longstanding Consortium processes for allocating these funds are described in each subsection below.  The Specific Aims of Developmental Funds are to:  1. Provide critical research support for up to 9 new Consortium investigators per year in areas of high strategic  importance to the Consortium, including solid tumor translational research, immunotherapy, health disparities  research, health economics and obesity research.  2. Provide pilot funding to stimulate 5-7 of the most innovative Consortium cancer research projects annually.  Awards will be targeted to areas of strategic growth (see specific aim 1) as well as to encourage new avenues  of research to support the most promising new projects in cancer diagnosis, treatment or prevention, with  emphasis placed on likelihood of stimulating follow-on funding and potential impact in the catchment area.  3. Develop a new Biomedical Informatics shared resource. This resource has been strongly endorsed by  senior leaders and our External Advisory Board, and will integrate data on all Consortium patients, specimens,  clinical trials and studies, and associated genomics or other assay data, and efficiently support the further  development of Consortium solid tumor translational research.  4.

By drawing on established  and new partnerships, the Program is also building research that addresses American Indian cancer disparities  and priorities identified by NM Tribes, Pueblos, and Indian Nations. Major scientific accomplishments in Risk  Prediction and Risk Reduction include the identification of social, lifestyle, and genetic factors associated with  lung cancer risk; gene-environment interactions in melanoma risk; and development and dissemination of a  novel telehealth strategy for the prevention of hepatocellular cancer. In Screening, members have developed a  statewide surveillance program of screening and diagnosis for cervical pre-cancer and cancer that informs real-  world cervical cancer prevention through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, screening practice and  outcomes. Members have also identified barriers to use of early detection tests in colorectal cancer and have  developed strategies to overcome these barriers to improve screening in underserved populations. In Post-  Diagnosis Outcomes and Survivorship, members have identified factors that contribute to disparities in post-  treatment outcomes and survivorship in endometrial and breast cancer and are developing interventions. Led by  Linda Cook, PhD and Anita Kinney, PhD, RN, the CaC Program is comprised of 28 members (19 full and 9  associate) from 7 UNM schools and departments, the Lovelace Respiratory Institute, and the Indian Health  Service Unit of the Centers for Disease Control whose work is supported by $19,276,863 million in annual direct  cost funding, of which $15,429,911 million is peer-reviewed and $3,137,820 million is from NCI as of 9/1/2014.  The discoveries made in this Program have resulted 294 publications, of which 19% are intra-programmatic  collaborations and 16% are inter-programmatic collaborations; with a total UNMCC and external collaborative  publication level of 30% and 80%, respectively."
"9187648","ADMINISTRATIVE CORE ? PROJECT SUMMARY  The overarching framework for this MIT/Mayo PS-OC is to understand the physical interactions between drugs,  tumor tissue and the microenvironment that influence drug distribution and how potentially heterogeneous drug  distribution influences tumor cell signaling and therapy resistance emergence (drug efficacy). The PS-OC will  require a strong administrative unit to support and coordinate Center activities across all sites, projects and  cores; including day-to-day administrative and financial support, planning and evaluation, ongoing  communications, pilot and trans-network projects, CAC activities, participation in PS-ON Steering Committee  and other initiatives developed over the life of the project. The MIT/Mayo PS-OC will be administratively based  at MIT's Koch Institute of Integrative Cancer Research, an NCI-designated Cancer Center that was established  in 1974. As demonstrated with past center grants based at the KI, this will allow us to leverage an existing,  well-organized administrative infrastructure that will provide support for all business aspects related to the  Center. Primary responsibility for scientific project management and managing the workflow of bio-specimens  and related high-content data between the two Research Projects and two Shared Resource Cores will be  based at the Mayo Clinic. Jointly the members of both teams will be referred to as the Administrative Unit (AU)."

"9129455","Established in 2004 in response to a growing need for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and modelling, the  Clinical Pharmacology Analytical Core (CPAC) helps investigators by providing detailed information on drug  interactions, quantification of drugs and metabolites, and protein binding of small molecules. CPAC services  include preliminary determination of drug metabolism and metabolite identification for future use. These  capabilities have been enhanced since acquiring the API 5500 Q-Trap instrument (described below). Once  validated in the shared resource, chargebacks are calculated by the IUSCC administration. The process of  rational drug design is built upon a strong foundation of biology, chemistry, in vivo pharmacology, and PK.  Relevant PK and metabolism studies should be conducted in small animal models or in vitro systems before  first drug administration in humans. This allows for the iterative process of implementing structural changes  in the drug molecule to optimize the activity of the drug and its pharmacological and PK properties prior to  moving to the more regulated and expensive clinical phase of drug development. PK plays an important role  in the determination of drug action. The drug discovery process should provide a delicate balance between  the chemistry, pharmacology, and PK of the drug. To coordinate these efforts, CPAC is now interacting  closely with In Vivo Therapeutics (IVTC), Chemical Genomics, Center for Computational Biology and  Bioinformatics, and other IUSCC shared resources. Over the past few years, CPAC and IVTC have worked  together to generate data that help Pls better evaluate molecules developed within the IUSCC that show  promise as novel cancer drugs. IVTC performs the live phase study {in vivo) and collects samples for CPAC  to perform the kinetics. Both core leaders are directly involved in study design prior to project initiation. PK  and metabolism data provide important information to guide drug design and treatment in pre-clinical drug  discovery (bench) as well as in clinical drug development and treatment (bedside) with efforts focused on  evaluation of toxicity and efficacy of new drug candidates. CPAC's state-of-the-art technology and expertise  supports research and development of safe and more efficacious drug treatment for IUSCC investigators"

"9001931","Immunology and Vaccine Development Program  The Immunology and Vaccine Development (IVD) Program bring together researchers and clinicians engaged  in the study of cancer immunobiology, basic immunology, immunotherapy, vaccinology, and infectious  diseases who shared a vision of developing immunologic strategies that could be deployed to harness the  immune system for targeting malignancies as well as infectious diseases that develop and progress in  immuno-compromised individuals. Modulating the immune system with vaccines for the prevention of human  infections has had many very dramatic successes, but the paradigms and strategies for reagent development  to prevent diseases such as polio or diphtheria have proven neither adequate nor readily translatable to  infections such as HIV and tuberculosis or to the treatment of cancer. The IVD program strengthens existing  collaborative interactions, provides opportunities for new collaborations, and promotes a synergy of research  efforts that will accelerate progress in cancer immunology, immuno-therapeutics, and cancer vaccine  development. The program's 50 members, 96% of whom have peer-reviewed funding, are drawn from all three  partners institutions, three schools and 16 departments. The program has $16.8M in peer reviewed funding,  including $4.8M from the NCI (direct dollars.) Program members are highly productive and collaborative, with  994 peer-reviewed publications during this grant period, of which 22% were intra-programmatic, 26% were  inter-programmatic and 22% were inter-institutional. The program's specific aims are to:   1. Develop a greater breadth of cellular therapy interventional clinical trials, including initiating trials to   advance cellular therapy to become an approved standard therapy for leukemia and solid tumors.   2. Define the immunological obstacles in the host and tumor microenvironment that interfere with effective   immunotherapeutic targeting of tumors so that strategies can be developed to effectively treat   cancers not currently responsive to therapy.   3. Identify, test, and validate improved strategies for infection control in immune compromised cancer  patients.   4. Adapt and translate insights from our basic, preclinical, and clinical studies in vaccine biology to   enhance immune responses to cancer antigens and improve the efficacy of adoptive T cell transfer."

"9149422","Developmental Funds Core: Project Summary   The Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) uses Developmental Funds to strengthen  cancer-related science through support of faculty recruitment and development of a Shared Resource,  specifically the Computational and Medicinal Chemistry Shared Resource (CMC-SR). Previous  Developmental Funds were used to support faculty recruitment that enhanced the PCCR's science discovery  base, especially in epigenetics, and also strengthened drug discovery. Shared Resource development  facilitated PCCR achievement of its scientific objectives and strengthened PCCR Research Programs through  improving target validation and in vivo drug evaluation. The PCCR will continue to use Developmental Funds  to support, in part, start-up packages for new faculty recruits. These funds are important to the PCCR as they  provide an important source of monies that can be leveraged for recruiting new faculty who will help PCCR  achieve the objectives established in the Center's Strategic Plan. In addition, funds are requested to establish  the CMC-SR which will provide much needed support for the development of chemical probes and small  molecule therapeutic compounds. The primary mission of the CMC-SR is to accelerate the development of  molecular probes and small molecule therapeutics for PCCR members. Through accomplishing this mission,  the CMC-SR will provide a crucial and previously ?missing link' in the drug discovery pipeline, between the  Biomolecular Screening services offered by Purdue's Bindley Biosciences Center and PCCR's Biological  Evaluation Shared Resource (BE-SR)."

In Specific Aim #1,  dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) and diffusion weighted (DW) MRl will be evaluated in a multi-center  clinical trial of patients with soft tissue sarcoma ofthe extremities receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior  to surgical resection. DCE- and DW-MRI imaging will be performed prior to and at the conclusion of  chemotherapy to evaluate the correlation between treatment response assessed with MRl parameters  (permeability, perfusion, and diffusion) and tumor histopathology obtained from surgical resection.  Exploratory analysis will also be performed to compare imaging and pathologic response with clinical  outcome. In Specific Aim #2, two novel PET apoptosis probes (18F-ML-10 and 1241-Diannexin) will be  evaluated and compared to existing PET probes for glucose metabolism (FDG) and cellular proliferation  (FLT). Similar strategies will be employed in Specific Aim #3 to evaluate hwo novel PET probes for  angiogenesis (i8F-FPP(RgD) and 892R-beYaci?Ufnat)). Preclinical microPET/CT imaQlno studiQS will bQ  performed in several sarcoma mouse models using the comprehensive panel of PET probes in longitudinal  treatment studies of various therapeutic agents. Correlations with tumor histopathology will be performed to  validate the imaging assessments. In addition, DCE and DW MRl imaging will be performed in the same  studies to compare the more specific PET assessments of metabolism, proliferation, angiogenesis, and  apopotosis with the MRl perfusion and diffusion measurements that are more clinically available. This will  further refine and validate the interpretation of MRl imaging response measured in Specific Aim #1 as well  develop more specific PET imaging probes for future clinical trials. Together, the Specific Aims of this  proposal will advance bi-directional translational research that enhances the knowledge of clinical MRl  biomarkers for assessing early drug response in sarcoma therapy (bedside to bench) as well as develop  novel PET imaging agents that are translatable to clinical trials and patient care (bench to bedside)."

NFNAP includes statistically based sampling plans for Key Foods, and analysis of foods by qualified laboratories. The four Specific Aims of the NFNAP are to: 1) identify major contributors of nutrients and other compounds identified by the sponsoring IC. Key Foods are frequently consumed foods and ingredients, which contributed, collectively, more than 75% of the intake of any specific nutrient for the U.S. population; 2) assess existing data quality for those identified contributors; 3) develop high quality, statistically-based nationwide sampling plans including high priority foods consumed by U.S. ethnic subpopulations using scientifically appropriate validated methodologies for rigorous quality control; and 4) develop validated databases as needed to disseminate nationally representative estimates for means and variability for foods and bioactive food components in dietary supplements. Analytical data generated through the NFNAP are compiled and released in annual updates of the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR). They are also used to calculate estimates for related foods not analyzed, to assess nutrient variability, and to evaluate methods for estimating the nutrient content of multi-ingredient foods. These data will be used by the Food Surveys Research Group (FSRG), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) to develop the Food and Nutrient Dataset for Dietary Surveys used in the ?What We Eat in America?

"9149765","ABSTRACT ? TUMOR INITIATION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM  The overall goals of the Tumor Initiation and Maintenance (TIM) Program are to identify the cells that give rise  to tumors and the signals that allow these cells to expand uncontrollably, and to use this information to develop  more effective approaches to treating human cancer. The TIM Program was established in 2013, when the  Cancer Center was reorganized, with NCI's approval, to enhance interaction and collaboration among  members. Led by Dr. Wechsler-Reya, the Program consists of 17 faculty and 2 adjunct faculty, including many  members of the former Tumor Development and Signal Transduction Programs. TIM Program members have  a wide range of cancer-relevant interests including self-renewal, cell cycle progression, oncogenic signaling  pathways, ubiquitin ligases and regulation of cell fate by non-coding RNAs. Encompassing these interests, the  Program is comprised of three overarching themes: Stem Cells and Development (focusing on the molecular  and cellular mechanisms that control self-renewal, differentiation, and transformation); Cell Growth Signaling  (studying the factors and processes that regulate normal and malignant cell growth); and RNA Biology and  Epigenetics (investigating the regulation of gene expression and cell fate by DNA and histone modification and  by non-coding RNAs). The program has a strong cancer focus, with particular emphasis on brain tumors,  melanoma, breast and prostate cancer. Program members interact closely with one another and other Cancer  Center members, resulting in numerous collaborative grants and joint publications. Of the 38 grants awarded to  Program members through both NCI and other peer-reviewed cancer-related mechanisms, 39% were  collaborative. Members also published 254 cancer relevant papers in the last funding period, of which 22%  were collaborative (10% intra-programmatic and 12% inter-programmatic). In the coming years, the TIM  Program will seek to recruit new faculty, particularly in the areas of genomics, epigenetics and animal models  of cancer. In addition, Program members will focus on translational research to move findings from basic  cancer biology toward the clinic."
"9148028","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The role of the Organoid Core (Core E) is to generate a bank of state-of-the-art next-generation 3D in vitro  organoid models of prostate cancer and provide them to the SPORE research projects for investigation. The  study of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has been limited by lack of in vitro models that represent  the molecular and phenotypic diversity of the disease. We have developed optimized growth conditions for 3D  prostate organoids from benign human and mouse prostate epithelial cells that can be engineered with defined  genetic lesions using patient-derived CRPC biopsy specimens. The organoids maintain the histology and 3D  architecture of the cancer tissue. We have generated 17 CRPC organoid lines over the past 2 years that  harbor a number of genetic alterations not present in publicly available cell line models. Leveraging our  program's commitment to collect, annotate, and sequence biopsy specimens from >2000 patients with CRPC,  we plan to establish 20 clinically and molecularly annotated CRPC organoid lines annually.  We will collaborate with each research project to engineer and study CRPC organoids that harbor specific  genetic alterations or molecular phenotypes, including those with mutations in the DNA repair pathway (RP-1),  mutations in the PI3K pathway (RP-2), mutations in TP35, silencing of RB1, and/or altered lineage  specification (RP-3), and overexpression of different glucocorticoid receptor isoforms (RP-4). Working with the  Animal Models Core (Core D), we will generate murine prostate organoids from genetically engineered mouse  models harboring the specific genetic alterations of interest for the research projects. We will work with each  project to develop protocols for in vitro drug treatment, in vivo xenograft studies, and genetic engineering of the  organoid lines such as RNAi-mediated knockdown and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic  repeats)-mediated somatic knockout.  We will also conduct independent research aimed at improving services, including further optimization of  organoid acquisition and growth protocols, identification of clinical and molecular determinants of successful  organoid growth, and development of protocols to engineer genetic lesions into benign human prostate  organoids."
"9107357","EARLY PHASE CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT (EPCRS)  ABSTRACT  Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) at the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC),  led by Olivier Rixe, MD, PhD, supports the development and the conduct of early phase investigator-initiated  trials (IITs). The goal of ECPRS is to increase the pace at which discoveries by UNMCC members are  translated into the design and conduct of innovative early phase investigator-initiated trials that are accessible  to all New Mexicans. This objective is supported by the cutting-edge, cancer-focused research in the four  UNMCC Research Programs, in particular the translational pipeline developed in the Cancer Therapeutics:  Technology, Discovery, and Targeted Delivery (CT) Program, and the UNMCC clinical research infrastructure  that includes the Clinical Trials Office, Shared Resources and the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance  (NMCCA), a UNMCC-based statewide cancer clinical trials network. In the current funding period, the UNMCC  used Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) Developmental Funds in combination with funds from other  UNMCC sources to supplement CCSG-supported Early Phase Clinical Research Support (formerly known as  Protocol Specific Research Support (PSRS)) to provide the clinical research infrastructure and funding for  associated-laboratory studies for early phase clinical trials that were designed by UNMCC members. Since  2010, 10 Phase 0 and Phase I studies have been supported by UNMCC. In 2013, 28 patients were enrolled on  3 pilot Phase I institutional clinical trials. These IITs all resulted from research findings by UNMCC members  and involved different protein targets from multiple pathways (GTPases, DNA repair proteins, integrins) in a  large variety of cancers (ovary, leukemia, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and other  solid tumors). Following guidance from the UNMCC External Advisory Committee, several major changes have  been implemented to enhance early phase clinical research at the UNMCC. Olivier Rixe, MD, PhD, an expert  in early phase clinical trials and drug development, was recruited as Associate Director for Clinical Research,  joining the UNMCC on July 1, 2014. The infrastructure for the UNMCC Phase I unit has also been reorganized  and expanded to enhance the impact of the EPCRS component. Processes have been established to stimulate  direct collaborations between the UNMCC Clinical Working Groups and the four UNMCC Research Programs  that focus on the development of novel concepts for early phase clinical trials based on research findings by  UNMCC members. These concepts will be evaluated using a unique prioritization system involving the Clinical  Working Groups and the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee. The UNMCC has committed $500,000  per year from other funding sources in addition to the requested CCSG funds for EPCRS, with the goal of  increasing the proportion of novel and innovative early phase investigator-initiated studies within the UNMCC  clinical trial portfolio. More than 27 concepts are currently being investigated for further clinical development."

"9108263","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Gene Targeting and Transgenic facility was founded over 20 years ago to assist AECC researchers in the generation of genetically modified mouse models of human disease. Until recently, the Gene Targeting and Transgenic components operated as independent Shared Resources, each being rated outstanding at the last CCSG review. Following relocation to new state-of-the-art laboratory space in the Price Center, the facilities were merged into one Gene Targeting and Transgenic Shared Resource. The Transgenic component of the facility continues to generate, with high efficiency (-100% success rate), transgenic mouse strains through the introduction of DNA sequences, such as regular plasmid vectors or BAC clones into the germ line by pronuclear injection or by lentivirus infection of fertilized oocytes. For each project, the facility supervisor consults with individual investigators and advises on transgene construct design, as well as making plasmids and sequence cassettes available to ensure suitable for expression in the mouse. Typically 20-25 investigators use this service with approximately 100 constructs injected per year. The Gene Targeting component continues to provide services for modification of the mouse genome through the use of gene targeting methods in embryonic stem (ES) cells and introduction of these changes into the mouse germline. Gene Targeting services include the generation of conventional knockout mouse lines, knock-in mouse lines and mouse lines with conditional alleles for the temporal and spatial ablation of genes. The facility has a high success rate (>95%) for obtaining gene targeted mouse. Finally, a new Gene Modification Service was implemented by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to provide a complete service for the rapid and cost efficient generation of genetically modified mouse lines to all AECC investigators. Services include the design and generation of simple and complex gene targeting vectors, electroporation and screening of embryonic stem cell lines of various genetic backgrounds (129, B6 and 129/06) and the generation of chimeric mice by blastocyst injection (performed by the Gene Targeting facility). The Gene Modification Service has also developed new technologies and procedures for high-throughput generation of targeting vectors and screening procedures and began full operation in early 2012."

The CDP has the following objectives: 1) to identify,  recruit, and fund promising investigators who are new to the field of head and neck cancer, particularly  investigators who are newly independent; 2) to mentor these investigators in the field of translational head and  neck cancer research and, in the case of new investigators, in the skills needed to be successful independent  investigators; and 3) to assist these investigators in applying for head and neck cancer-related funding and in  developing future Projects within the Head and Neck SPORE mechanism. The faculty within the SPORE  includes a multidisciplinary roster of basic scientists and clinicians, all with a long-standing record in mentoring  postdoctoral fellows, young scientists and research-oriented clinicians for careers in translational research. In  the current funding period, we supported 7 junior faculty members in the CDP, including four women. All seven  CDP-supported faculty members have received peer-reviewed funding in HNSCC and/or achieved objective  career advancements. Two (Drs.

"9279862","Currently available AR antagonists such as bicalutamide have limited activity in castration-resistant prostate  cancer (CRPC). Mechanistic studies have shown that the bicalutamide liganded AR can accumulate in the  nucleus and bind to chromatin, but that it does not effectively recruit coactivator proteins and instead can  recruit the corepressor proteins NCoR and SMRT. This ability to mediate chromatin binding may be an  Achilles Heal of these agents, as it could facilitate their acquisition of weak or possibly strong agonist  activity in CRPC. In contrast to these currently available antagonists, MDV3100 does not enhance nuclear  localization or simulate chromatin binding, and recently reported phase III trial results show that MDV3100  can prolong survival in CRPC. These findings likely will lead to FDA approval of MDV3100 in the near future,  arming medical oncologists with two new agents (abiraterone and MDV3100) that can effectively suppress  AR activity in CRPC. Therefore, it is now critical to understand in detail mechanisms of action for MDV3100  and related AR antagonists under development, to determine how they might best be used in conjunction  with abiraterone, and to identify mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance. Our overall objectives in  this proposal are to understand how MDV3100 and functionally related AR antagonists interfere with AR  binding to chromatin, and to identify mechanisms of resistance. Our recent studies have shown that  phosphorylation of serine 81 (S81) in the AR N-terminal domain is critical for stable binding of AR to  chromatin. Moreover, our data indicate that the primary mechanism of action of MDV3100 is to prevent  chromatin binding, and that MDV3100 interferes with a S81 dependent step in AR chromatin binding. Based  on these findings, our general approach is to determine the molecular basis for S81 dependent AR binding to  chromatin (Aim 1) and to determine how MDV3100 and functionally related antagonists interfere with this  binding (Aim 2). We will then evaluate candidate mechanisms of MDV3100 resistance in cell line models  (Aim 2), and in xenograft models and clinical samples (Aim 3)."

Once cloud computing requirements and design are specified, additional, follow-on implementation and operational services task orders will be procured.   A critical program informing NCI?s Cloud Strategy is the Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilot Program. The Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) Pilots are Research and Development efforts designed to explore innovative methods for accessing and computing on large-scale genomic data. They aim to bring data and analysis tools together on a single platform by creating a set of data repositories with co-located computational capacity and an Application Programming Interface (API) that provides secure data access. The goals of the Cloud Pilots are to democratize access to NCI-generated genomic and related data and to create a cost-effective way to provide computational support to the cancer research community.  To complete CGC testing and evaluation and provide critical input into the definition, design, and implementation of an NCI cloud strategy, CBIIT must complete evaluation of one of these Cloud Pilots that is implemented on the Google Cloud Platform and operated by the Broad Institute. In order to complete the evaluation and testing, CBIIT requires Google Cloud Platform computing time and data storage that will cover the costs associated with evaluation of the CGC pilot platform by the research community."
"9149602","Project Summary - Project 1  Long-term success in the treatment of tobacco-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is  hindered by an alarming rate of second primary tumor (SPT) development following curative treatment.  Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC develop a SPT of the upper aerodigestive tract at  the rate of 3-6% per year, and are most likely to succumb to these secondary cancers. Although smoking  cessation reduces the occurrence of SPTs, moderation of risk is not observed for 5 years, and is insufficient to  return risk to baseline. The availability of a well-tolerated and affordable intervention that prevents SPTs would  have a major global impact on mortality and quality of life in patients at risk. Unfortunately, no tolerable and  effective chemopreventive agents have been identified for HNSCC. Our broad, long-term goal is the rigorous  translational development of a tolerable and effective chemoprevention strategy against HNSCC SPTs.  Reduced risk for HNSCC and SPTs is associated with diets rich in the Brassica family of cruciferous  vegetables, including broccoli. Broccoli is rich in glucoraphanin, which is metabolized to the key bioactive  component sulforaphane (SF). SF induces the expression of the transcription factor NRF2, which leads to  upregulation of NRF2 target genes. A number of NRF2 target genes encode cytoprotective enzymes, which  act to detoxify environmental carcinogens including benzene, aldehydes and nitrosamines found in tobacco  smoke. The relevance of the NRF2 signaling pathway for oral cancer chemoprevention is highlighted by the  enhanced susceptibility of mice lacking the Nrf2 gene to oral cancer induced by the carcinogen 4NQO. We are  developing broccoli seed preparations (BSPs) as a chemopreventive agent against carcinogen-induced  cancers, and have determined the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BSPs in humans. We have also  shown that SF induces NRF2 and NRF2 target gene expression in normal oral keratinocytes and in HNSCC  cell lines. Moreover, we have provided first-time demonstration that transcripts for NRF2 target genes are  upregulated in the oral mucosa of healthy volunteers treated with SF-rich BSP. We hypothesize that NRF2  pathway activation in oral epithelium can be induced by administering BSP to patients curatively treated for a  first tobacco-related HNSCC, and that the target level of NRF2 pathway activation for chemopreventive  efficacy in humans can be determined in a mouse model of carcinogen-induced HNSCC. To test this  hypothesis we propose two Specific Aims: 1) To investigate the dose-response relationship between  sulforaphane (SF) and chemopreventive efficacy in a mouse model of carcinogen-induced HNSCC, and 2) To  systematically assess the clinical chemopreventive potential of BSP administration to patients with tobacco-  related HNSCC at high risk for SPT."
"9120323","Lead Development and Optimization Shared Resource  The Lead Development and Optimization (LDO) shared resource is a mission critical element of KUCC that allows us to redefine translational research in an academic cancer center. It is a key component of the Cancer Center's strategy to optimize the rapid movement of basic research findings into new therapeutic advances either through traditional lead compound development and optimization, or drug repurposing strategies. The LDO fosters translational research by: 1) providing support to researchers and clinicians engaged in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for treatment and prevention of cancer, 2) providing drug discovery, delivery and development expertise to KUCC translational research projects, and 3) supporting key collaborations with industry, academic, government and disease philanthropy organizations with whom we have established collaborations in support of the goals and themes of our  scientific research programs.    The LDO, directed by Michael J. Baltezor, PhD, is a multi-component shared resource that provides unique expertise and capabilities in drug discovery, delivery, and development that is rarely available in an academic setting. Through a combination of highly trained, industry-experienced scientists and state-of the- art equipment the LDO is capable of supporting the development of novel cancer therapeutics in the following preclinical spaces:    1) Drug Discovery High Throughput Screening (HTS) - research and development focused on target selection and validation for high throughput method development and compound probe screening;  2) Drug Delivery Biotechnology Innovation and Optimization Facility (BIOF) - research and  development focused on conventional and novel drug delivery and animal pharmacokinetic support;  3) Preclinical Proof of Concept (PPOC) - in vitro lead optimization and development of new and improved animal models for cancer to test lead molecules with capabilities to perform whole animal imaging in rodents.    The LDO provided support for 51 research projects in 2010, 32 (62%) were led by KUCC members. During the past three years the LDO was instrumental in helping advance five drug therapies by KUCC investigators into Phase I clinical trials and to do so in a cost effective and efficient manner. Overall, Cancer Center members with peer-reviewed research funding used approximately 75% of the LDO's capacity."

CLS staff has been included in 44 Cancer Center member publications as co-  authors, reflecting their important contribution to these scientific discoveries. In addition, data produced by  CLS, access to chemical libraries and advanced instrumentation, consulting, and other services, contributed to  at least 37 additional publications. The CCSG funding (10% of the total CLS budget), leverages substantial  institutional investment in this extensive drug discovery infrastructure, and provides Cancer Center researchers  with priority access to this technology strongly supporting both discovery and early translational research."
"9149762","5.9 Abstract - FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS (Core Group B)  The Functional Genomics Shared Resource (FG) (Core Group B) enables Cancer Center members to  rapidly perform large-scale genetic screens in cells. FG provides high-throughput screening (HTS)  infrastructure, expertise, and services to perform both loss- and gain-of-function studies. In addition, the Core  offers a variety of services to facilitate the screen follow up process including the production of high quality viral  preparations, validation of RNAi reagents, and the creation of custom mutated cell lines for in vitro and in vivo  target validation. Since its inception in 2006, Functional Genomics has continued to evolve and adapt to meet  the specific needs of Cancer Center investigators. During the last funding period, the Core increased gene  coverage to siRNAs targeting the whole genome, established cDNA library overexpression protocols as well as  miRNA gain and loss of function screening. Lentiviral methods for functional studies were implemented to  address biological questions in a wider range of cellular systems. The independent operational infrastructure of  the Core has also been enhanced. FG currently occupies a dedicated laboratory with all the instrumentation  needed for efficient preparation of cells and assays, while still additionally leveraging the capabilities of other  Facilities such as High Content Screening, Genomics and Bioinformatics to expand its capabilities and utilize  additional expertise. In addition, usage of the Core (a new Shared Resource at the previous renewal) has been  significantly increased, with 29 Cancer Center members supported in the past year. The projects performed by  FG range from cancer metabolism to screening to achieve mechanistic understanding of compounds with  therapeutic potential. Over the last funding period, 40 projects have been either completed or are in progress,  and the Core has supported 24 publications, with 9 additional publications anticipated during the next year. An  important role of the Core is to evaluate and implement new technologies. Major areas of technical  development under progress at FG include functional analysis of patient-derived primary tumor lines, adoption  of 3D culture techniques in HT formats, and the applications of CRISPR-Cas9 based technologies. With the  anticipated increase in demand of functional genomics services, the Core will continue to focus on genome-  wide loss of function screening as primary tools while develop new technologies outlined above. FG will play a  major role in the Center addressing questions in the areas of autophagy, stress, cancer metabolism, and  epigenetics. Overall, FG-supported studies will lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets as well as  enhance our understanding of mechanisms of drug efficacy and development of drug resistance in cancers."
"9108273","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis Program focuses on the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment that are determinants of the potential of tumor cells to invade surrounding tissues, penetrate blood vessels, and ultimately enter and grow in distant tissues. Studies are directed to deciphening the signaling pathways and mechanical interactions among monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and carcinoma cells, and each of their supporting stroma, which contribute to the metastatic phenotype. The goals of the program are to: (1) Dissect the role the microenvironment in tumor progression and metastasis, in particular, the contribution of macrophage subpopulations to the various phases and elements of tumor progression; 2) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of growth factor and cytokine action in regulating cell migration, dissemination, angiogenesis and invasion of distant sites by primary tumor cells; 3) to assess the role of surface molecules, such a cadherins and membrane surface oligosaccharides, in tumor progression; (4) to characterize the biochemical and structural properties of molecules that regulate cytoskeletal proteins involved in tumor cell and macrophage motility through the development of (i) fluorescent biosensors of the activity status of pathways involved in regulating cell migration in vivo and (ii) photo-switchable proteins for quantitative long-term tracking of distinct groups of cells photomarked in the primary tumor and (5) to translate these findings into correlative studies with human tissues that are predictive of metastatic potential and risk, and that identify therapeutic targets. New imaging technologies are developed in the Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center that provides this program with unique tools that are made available to the broader AECC community through the Analytical Imaging Shared Resource. Intrinsic to the experimental approach is the development of novel mouse transgenic models with fluorescently-labeled cellular lineages. The research by members of this program is integrated by a major shared focus on breast cancer, although other tumor types are studied as well. Research in this program is supported, in part, by a program project grant which reflects, and furthers, the collaborative research of members of this program. There are currently 24 members from 11 departments, of whom 10 are new to the program, supported by 22 NCI grants ($4.1M Direct) and 18 other peer-reviewed cancer-relevant grants ($3.5M Direct). Since the last CCSG review there have been 239 cancer-relevant research papers by members of this program of which 23% represent intraprogrammatic, and 28% represent interprogrammatic publications."
"9125771","The overall goal of this SPORE application is to develop more effective targeted molecular therapies and biomarkers for glioblastoma. The four proposed projects focus on 1) Overcoming resistance to VEGF inhibition by targeting Angiopoietin-2; 2) Inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) pathway; 3) designing novel strategies for imaging and targeting IDH mutant gliomas; and 4) Increasing the radiosensitivity of glioblastomas by inhibiting the bHLH transcription factor Olig2. One ofthe innovative themes of this SPORE proposal is that biospecimens collected by the Pathology Core will be comprehensively moiecuiariy profiled using multiplexed technologies so projects may effectively evaluate the interaction of targeted therapies and their targets. The Pathology Core will support the goals of the SPORE by providing expert neuropathologic review, biospecimen banking and clinical trial support. In addition, the  Pathology Core will be a centralized resource for clinically and moiecuiariy annotated glioblastoma tissues  and primary glioblastoma cell cultures that will be essential to the success of the proposed projects. By centralizing these activities, the Pathology Core will ensure the safe and effective use of finite glioblastoma tissue resources without limiting the scope of the translational research planned in this proposal. The SPORE support, combined with significant institutional support for these goals, will ensure that over the next 5 years the Pathology Gore will provide the critical research infrastructure required for successful, collaborative translational research ofthe SPORE program."
"9001919","Translational Bioimaging Core Shared Resource  Project Summary/Abstract  The Translational BioImaging Core (TBIC) provides state of the art imaging capabilities, including magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and  optical imaging, to support preclinical and clinical research projects conducted by Consortium members.  Operations are coordinated between the University of Washington (UW) Department of Radiology and the Fred  Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  During the project period, the TBIC (formerly the Animal Bio-imaging Core) focused on further development of  preclinical imaging capabilities. New instruments such as 14T MRI, research PET-CT, high-intensity focused  ultrasound, a large research data server, and an animal angiographic device have been implemented through  NIH/NSF Shared Instrumentation grants, institutional support, and industrial collaborations. A MicroPET  scanner has been obtained through an NIH Shared Instrumentation grant and has been used already for  multiple Consortium projects. A new tabletop MRI unit and a two-photon microscope for in vivo tumor imaging  are currently being installed at FHCRC. In addition, the existing high-frequency ultrasound platform for  preclinical studies has been upgraded. A proposal for a MicroCT scanner that can be docked with the  MicroPET scanner is currently under NIH Shared Instrumentation review. A new Molecular Tracer Laboratory  has been established in downtown Seattle. This facility provides radiotracers for PET imaging at multiple sites  across institutions, a capability that was not available during the last funding period. In collaboration with the  Radiochemistry Laboratory that provides outstanding expertise in radiotracer developments, investigators  employed new tracers such as [C-11]clorgyline and [C-11]rosuvastatin. New immunology imaging studies  have been initiated in collaboration with UW and FHCRC experts, radiochemistry, and local industries. The  technology can be applied widely to new projects that involve biologics in their therapeutic or diagnostic  research. Such planning priorities are determined by the TBIC and its advisory committee.  The TBIC consolidates inter-institutional efforts to support Consortium preclinical and clinical imaging research.  The goal of these efforts is to facilitate more translational imaging research among the Consortium members  and to better support cancer imaging research. Imaging instrumentation and its maintenance are costly, and  the Consortium or a single institution cannot acquire or support all imaging resources. The shared resource is  not only effective in bringing imaging experts and scientists together, but is also a cost-effective and  sustainable way to support cancer imaging research across programs, institutions and sites."
"9149767","ABSTRACT ? TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT AND METASTASIS  The overarching goals of the Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis (TMEM) Program are to define how the  interplay between cancer cells, stromal components, and the ECM creates an environment permissive for  tumor growth and metastasis, and to use this knowledge to facilitate the development of new and more  effective cancer therapies. The TMEM Program was reconfigured in 2013 during the restructuring of the  Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (SBMRI) Cancer Center, which brought together members of the  former Tumor Microenvironment Program and investigators interested in the immune and inflammatory  components of the tumor microenvironment, who were previously members of other programs. The Program  consists of 15 faculty (two of whom are new recruits) and four adjunct members, with expertise in structural  biology, carbohydrate chemistry, cryo-electron microscopy, computational analysis, signal transduction,  integrin biology, animal models of tumor growth and metastasis, innate and adaptive immune mechanisms,  and functional chemical genomic strategies for target identification. The complementary expertise brought by  program faculty is organized around three interacting themes: Angiogenesis and Immune/inflammatory  Modulation; Cell Migration, Invasion and Metastasis; and Defining New Intervention Points for Cancer Therapy.  Members interact at a number of levels, including monthly faculty meetings, program-led seminars (18 in the  last funding period), strategic meetings organized around new collaborative opportunities (for example, the  interface of the human microbiome and cancer), and collaborative grants. Program funding is strong, with  current total annual grant funding of $6.1M (direct costs). Members currently lead 34 grants including 13 R01s  (8 from NCI), 3 U01s (2 from NCI), and lead or participate in 5 P01s (2 from NCI), and multiple other grants  (DOD, Komen, SU2C). 14 (41%) of the grants are collaborative and multi-investigator. Our productivity is  reflected in 261 cancer-relevant publications in the last funding period, of which 27% were collaborative (16%  intra- and 12% inter-programmatic). In 2013 alone, we published 52 cancer-relevant publications, of which  21% were intra- and 12% inter-programmatic. In addition, program members contribute to the Cancer Center  as Scientific Directors of five Shared Resources (Animal Resources, Cell Imaging and Histology, Flow  Cytometry, Functional Genomics, and Structural Biology)."
"9211898","7. PROJECT SUMMARY  African Americans (AAs) are more likely to develop and die from cancer than any racial and ethnic group in the  United States (U.S.). Over the past two decades, there has been an increased focus on participation of AAs in  cancer clinical trials (CCTs) to address this disproportionate burden of cancer; however AAs continue to be  underrepresented in CCTs. The dearth of AAs participating in CCTs diminishes the generalizability of results of  trials. If AAs remain underrepresented in CCTs, the implications include slower progress in elucidating the  underlying causes of long-standing health disparities in cancer outcomes. There is an extensive body of  science detailing trial participation barriers among AAs, including limited access to specialty care centers  where trials are conducted, competing work obligations, and fear and mistrust of clinical research. Despite  these barriers, AAs are, inherently, no less willing to participate in CCTs or other types of research studies than  other racial or ethnic groups. The absence of differences in willingness to participate suggests that persistent  disparities in accrual may, in fact, be due to AAs being offered fewer opportunities than whites to participate in  CCTs. Although many interventions have focused on approaches to increase the willingness of AAs to  participate, perhaps efforts should be focused on increasing the opportunities among AAs to participate in  CCTs. We propose to adapt the IMPaCT patient navigation model and pilot a clinical trials navigator program,  IMPaCT 2.0, at Morehouse Healthcare (MH) and Grady Hospital (Grady), one of the largest safety-net  hospitals in the nation. We propose to enhance the patient navigation model with a mobile tablet-based clinical  trial tracking system (CTTS) (using i2b2 software) to facilitate increased engagement among AA patients  regarding CCT participation opportunities and to address deficits in the research infrastructure at these two  institutions. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we will identify those barriers and facilitators to AA recruitment at  MH/Grady (Specific Aim 1) and incorporate those findings into an adapted clinical trials navigation (CTN)  model with an integrated mobile tablet CTTS (Specific Aim 2)., We will implement IMPaCT 2.0 at MH/Grady  breast and prostate cancer clinics and evaluate, in a one-group, pre-/post-test design, the feasibility and  acceptability (Specific Aim 3)."
"9336547","PHY906 is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has been used in the Orient for nearly 2000 years to treat diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. Our research group has developed a novel cGMP formulation of PHY906 that has been shown to be free of heavy metals and any other contaminants. We have characterized the preclinical activity of PHY906 as a modulator of cytotoxicity of anticancer agents and a cytoprotective agent of chemotherapy. An extensive series of pre-clinical in vivo studies using mouse xenograft models have shown that this herbal medicine can enhance the antitumor activity of a broad range of anticancer agents, including the topo I inhibitor irinotecan, and reduce toxicity. Preliminary results from an initial phase l/lla clinical study with PHY906 in combination with IFL chemotherapy in the front-line treatment of advanced CRC patients showed that PHY906 was able to effectively reduce the Gl toxicities of diarrhea and nausea/vomiting as well as overall fatigue. These observations suggested that PHY906 can reduce the toxicities associated with irinotecan-based chemotherapy. However, this initial pilot study was unable to determine the potential effect of PHY906 on the clinical efficacy of irinotecan chemotherapy. Our hypothesis is that PHY906 will be able to enhance the safety profile associated with irinotecan chemotherapy and maintain, if not improve, the clinical activity associated with this anticancer agent. To directly address this hypothesis, we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial to investigate the effects ofthe Chinese herbal medicine PHY906 on the toxicity, quality of life, and clinical efficacy of irinotecan monotherapy in the treatment of patients with advanced CRC in the second-line setting. Patients will be randomized to receive the control arm of irinotecan plus placebo or to the experimental arm of irinotecan plus PHY906. As part of this clinical study, 3 specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will determine the effect of PHY906 on the safety profile of irinotecan monotherapy with a focus on Gl toxicity, in the form of diarrhea and nausea/vomiting, as well as myelosuppression and fatigue. Aim 2 will investigate the effect of PHY906 on overall quality of life associated with irinotecan monotherapy using well-established and validated patient-reported assessment tools.

ADMINISTRATION AND SENIOR LEADERSHIP  The Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (SBMRI) was founded as the La Jolla Cancer Research  Foundation in 1976 and became an NCI-designated Cancer Center in 1981. While other areas of research at  SBMRI have expanded over the past decade, cancer research remains the predominant activity (74% of  faculty). Because SBMRI and the Cancer Center have co-evolved, the Cancer Center has not needed its own  general administration and instead uses SBMRI's services, including Finance, Sponsored Research, Human  Resources, Administrative Assistants, Purchasing, Information Technology, External Relations, Facilities, and  Environmental Health & Services (EH&S). Thus, the Cancer Center Administration consists of a small team  that ensures the Center receives high-quality services from SBMRI Administration and focuses specifically on  the effective management of the Cancer Center and its operations within the CCSG Guidelines/FOA. The  Cancer Center Administrative Team holds monthly meetings with key members of SBMRI Administration to  ensure close coordination and to obtain necessary support for new Center initiatives. In addition to scheduled  monthly meetings, the Director and the Administrative leaders have frequent informal interactions to integrate  the Center Administration activities with the scientific goals of the Cancer Center. The Cancer Center  Administration leadership consists of the Associate Director for Administration and the Associate Director for  Shared Resources. The Center leadership and administration are supported by an Administrative Coordinator,  a Shared Resources Coordinator, and a Senior Administrative assistant whose salaries are supported by  SBMRI. The Cancer Center Leadership Team (CCLT), the de facto Cancer Center Executive Committee,  advises the Cancer Center Director on matters relating to Cancer Center membership, recommendations for  promotion, recruitment and space assignment, pilot project funding and other uses of CCSG development  funds. Final authority for decisions rests with the Cancer Center Director. At its monthly meetings, the CCLT  reviews progress toward attaining the Cancer Center's goals in strategic planning, which includes ongoing and  planned recruitments, mentoring, education, recruitment from minority and disadvantaged populations (with a  report by the Associate Director for Education and Mentoring, a new position for this submission), and  collaboration in team science, including institutional recognition of team science in promotion and tenure  decisions."
"9149605","Project Summary - Project 4  Project 4 is a new project that addresses the epidemic of thyroid cancer. Well-differentiated thyroid cancer is  increasing at an alarming rate. There has been a 3-fold increase in incidence of thyroid cancer in the past 3  decades. However, the mortality for these patients has remained very low (estimated to be ~2%). Therefore,  performing a thyroidectomy for all patients with that thyroid cancer may not be necessary. This project  addresses two major issues relevant to the thyroid cancer detection and management. Firstly, we will use next  generation sequencing to develop and validate a molecular test that can more accurately distinguish between  thyroid cancer and benign nodules in patients with needle biopsy results that are indeterminate. This molecular  test analyses the expression and/or mutation of 62 individual genes and builds on our previous experience  using a smaller panel of genes to diagnose thyroid cancer. In the second Aim, we will evaluate the ability of our  molecular testing to differentiate low-risk thyroid cancers from more aggressive (high-risk) thyroid cancers. In  order to accomplish this goal, we will first interrogate tissue samples obtained from patients who have  undergone surgery for thyroid cancer, and then experience disease recurrence or distant metastases.  Simultaneously, we will initiate a clinical trial to observe patients with small thyroid cancers. Patients with small  cancers will undergo upfront molecular testing and then will be observed. A molecular profile of high-risk  disease will be determined by the tumors from patients who progress during the observation period. This  information will then be used to inform the second phase of the trial, which will use the molecular signature to  separate patients into high-risk and low-risk disease for surgery or observation, respectively.  Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the NGS-based panel of mutational markers can reliably diagnose  cancer in thyroid nodules. This Aim seeks to develop and validate a novel molecular analytic test that can  accurately predict which thyroid nodules are malignant versus benign. We will develop the molecular test at the  University of Pittsburgh and then validate the utility of this test in 8 other academic centers.   Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that high-risk and low-risk differentiated thyroid cancers have distinct  mutational profiles that can be detected in FNA samples and utilized to guide patient management. This  Aim consists of two parts, the first sub-aim seeks to use molecular testing to characterize tissues derived from  patients with aggressive disease (experience recurrence of cancer or develop metastases). The second sub-  aim extends these data to develop and implement a prospective clinical trial that provides patients with small  cancers to have observation instead of surgery. The data from this trial will validate that molecular testing can  be used to stratify thyroid cancers into a low-risk subtype."
"9187649","Data Handling and Integration Core ? Summary  The ultimate goal of the MIT/Mayo PS-OC is to develop a multiscale predictive model connecting non-invasive  imaging (tissue scale) to predicted therapeutic distribution (tissue-cellular scale) and dynamic molecular  cellular response (cellular-molecular scale). Beyond this over-arching goal, the Data Handling and Integration  Core will provide key infrastructure to each Project through data management and storage, integration of  diverse data types, and model construction. The Core will be led by Dr. Douglas Lauffenburger, an expert in  systems biology and application of engineering principles to biological systems, with over twenty years of  expertise in developing computational modeling techniques and applying these approaches to extract key  biological insights from complex systems. Other members of the core include Dr. K. Dane Wittrup, an expert in  protein engineering and quantitative pharmacology, Dr. Kristin Swanson, an expert in computational modeling  with strong experience in extracting biological insight from non-invasive imaging techniques, and Dr. Nathalie  Agar, an expert in MALDI-MSI, stimulated Raman spectroscopy, and imaging of drug distribution in brain  tumors. Together, these investigators provide the requisite expertise and experience to fulfill each of the Core  functions. The primary responsibilities of the core include:  Core Task 1. Manage the data generated by the diverse array of analytical and physical biology methods that  will be employed in Projects 1 and 2 and extract relevant information from the data files generated by each  method.  Core Task 2. Data integration and computational modeling.  Core Task 3. Construction of a multiscale model predicting spatially resolved drug distribution and drug  efficacy (molecular and cellular response to therapy) from non-invasive MR imaging."
"9340309","Viral infections remain a significant cause of treatment failure in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recipients of cord blood (CB) or HSC from virus naive donors are at particular risk since their grafts contain no virus-specific memory T-cells. Antiviral drugs are effective only for some viruses, and most have significant toxicities. Adoptive transfer of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from the stem cell donor has proved safe and highly effective, but is available only for recipients of grafts from virus-experienced donors, thereby excluding those patients at highest risk. This lack of an effective strategy to activate and expand virus-specific T-cells from CB and naive donor T-cells has been a major obstacle to extending the approach to these high-risk recipients, whose continued prolonged morbidity and high mortality from viral diseases substantially reduces the cost:benefit ratio of the transplant procedure. We have developed a novel approach that effectively expands CTL specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenoviruses (Ad) from naive CB T-cells. We expressed the CMVpp65 antigen from an Ad vector in dendritic cells and used them together with T-cell enhancing cytokines to activate T-cells specific for pp65 and Ad vector-derived virion proteins. Subsequent restimulation with CB-derived EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines transduced with the same vector also reactivated an EBV-specific T-cell component, so that the final T-cell product contained T-cells that were specific for all three viruses, and recognized multiple viral epitopes. We produced and validated the function of the virus-specific CTL from the 20% fraction of cryopreserved CB that will be available to us for our proposed phase I clinical trial of these cells. We now hypothesize that virus-specific CTL prepared from virus-naive CB (Aim 1) will restore antiviral immunity and reduce viral infection in CBT recipients (Aim 2). In these aims we will discover (i) if administration of CB-derived T-cells with multiple viral specificities can produce immune reconstitution to all three viruses, or if there is a consistent hierarchy of recovery, favoring one viral specificity over the others and (ii) whether viral infections will be prevented or controlled after adoptive transfer of CB-derived CTL. Aim 3 will determine whether the mechanisms by which cord blood T-cells respond to latent viral antigens are associated with their naivety or developmental stage. Our studies will show whether this approach can consistently produce effective CTL directed to three of the commonest pathogenic viruses after CBT and whether this approach has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality after transplant."
"9105317","This project will focus on novel interactions between breast cancer cells and tumor associated macrophages  that contribute to increased tumor malignancy. Our previous studies have defined an EGFR/CSF1R  paracrine loop operating between these two cell types and its role in invasion and intravasation. In this  proposal we will evaluate additional novel interactions between tumor cells and macrophages which could be  critical for patient survival. We propose that neuregulins and CXCR2 ligands secreted by tumor cells  activate ErbB3 and CXCR2 on macrophages, resulting in increased production of AREG, HBEGF and  angiogenic factors by macrophages. HBEGF and AREG simulate tumor cell invasiveness, while the  angiogenic factors disrupt the endothelial barrier, with the combined results leading to increased  intravasafion. We propose three specific aims in which we will test these hypotheses. In Aim 1 we will  evaluate the role of stimulation of macrophage ErbB3 by neuregulins secreted by tumor cells. In Aim 2 we  will evaluate the role of macrophage CXCR2. In Aim 3, we will examine the roles of HBEGF, AREG and  angiogenic factors produced by macrophages. The project will integrate the use of in vitro and in vivo  models of intravasation and extravasation provided by Cores A, B, and C to study the role of these pathways  in breast cancer metastasis. Close collaboration with the other projects in the PPG will facilitate evaluation  of macrophage polarizafion and dynamics during invasion and metastasis (Project 1), mechanisms of  CSFl R synergy with ErbBS and GPCR signaling (Projects 2 and 4), and the roles played by the  ErbB3/CXCR2 pathways contributing to the various steps in transendothelial migration (Project 5). The  ultimate goal is to identify new options for prognosis and therapeutic interventions."
"9094431","Lung cancers are common and most often present with metastatic disease that cannot be cured by systemic therapies. Recent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) demonstrated partial responses in the majority of patients with activating EGFR mutations, but complete responses are rare and median progression-free survival remained below a year. In NSCLC patients without EGFR mutations, EGFR TKIs produce objective responses in less than 10% of patients, but with a small, statistically significant prolongation of survival. The development of drug resistance and progressive disease is universal. Improved therapy is clearly needed in both groups. Advanced lung cancers possess inherent or acquired survival mechanisms that can protect the cells from EGFR inhibition. Thus, the discovery of pathways that mediate these compensatory survival mechanisms could reveal novel therapeutic targets that would render kinase inhibition a more effective therapy for lung cancer. In the last grant period, we used a genome-wide shRNA screen and gene expression profiling to identify genes that when inhibited sensitize EGFR mutant and EGFR wild-type NSCLC cells to EGFR inhibition. These studies identified the FGFR and Wnt/?-catenin pathways as mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKIs. We further showed that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the FGFR pathway and multiple components of the canonical Wnt/?-catenin pathway identified in this screen, including tankyrase and casein kinase 2 (CK2), potentiated EGFR inhibitor therapy in vitro and in vivo. In this project, we propose to identify, validate and characterize signaling mechanisms underlying the inability of EGFR TKI to elicit complete therapeutic responses, in order to develop novel therapeutic combinations that can improve outcomes for patients with NSCLC. Importantly, we have been successful in the past in translating discoveries into biomarker-driven clinical trials. We will achieve these goals through three aims: 1) Pre-clinically and clinically evaluate the roles for FGFRs in innate resistance to EGFR TKI including the development of biomarkers and conduct of a Phase 1/1b clinical trials, 2) Determine optimal biomarkers for and the clinical efficacy in a Phase I/Ib clinical trial of combining EGFR TKI with tankyrase inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC, and 3) Determine biomarkers and establish the pre-clinical efficacy of combining EGFR TKI with CK2 inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC. By targeting multiple pathways, the ultimate goal of these studies is the development of therapeutic strategies for NSCLC patients that minimize the development of drug resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The overall goal of the Outreach Core of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to implement and evaluate,  Cancer Care Connect, an innovative enhanced care coordination model for cancer survivors that links health  system patient navigators (HSPNs) and survivorship care plans (SCPs) with community-based patient  navigators (CBPNs) to improve satisfaction with care, satisfaction with navigation services, and quality of life  among cancer survivors. The accomplishment of the study's goal will be facilitated by the Partnership's  decade-long history of recruiting, training, and engaging lay community health workers/advisors to promote  age-appropriate cancer screening, healthy lifestyles, and enrollment in cancer clinical trials. The patient  navigation model used by the Partnership has been successful in the context of cancer prevention, and now it  will be expanded to cover the entire cancer continuum, from diagnosis through survivorship. To our knowledge,  this will be the first study to extend patient care coordination from the health system to the community using  community navigation and SCPs. Following a baseline assessment, patients with a HSPN and SCP will be  linked to a CBPN, and the impact of the combined health system-based and community-based navigation will  be evaluated at multiple time points. We anticipate that cancer survivors receiving the Cancer Care Connect  will increase satisfaction with care, increase satisfaction with navigation services, and improved quality of life."

"9001933","Gastrointestinal Cancer Program  The Gastrointestinal (GI) Cancer Program is a team of clinician scientists and translational investigators who  work collaboratively towards the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality of GI cancers. GI cancers  account for a substantial portion of cancer related deaths in the US and, in aggregate, are the most common  cancer in the US. The most common GI cancers are colorectal cancer (143,000 cases/year), upper GI cancers  (17,000 esophageal cancers and 21,000 stomach cancers/year), liver cancer (29,000 cases/year), and  pancreatic cancer (44,000 cases/year). Thus, the GI Cancer Program has emphasized esophageal  adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer. The program has formed  multidisciplinary care teams and integrative research teams to provide cutting-edge clinical care that  incorporates innovative therapeutic trials into the care plans. Examples of these innovations include stromal  directed therapy for pancreatic cancer and state of the art molecular diagnostic assay development. There are  32 members in the program, from two institutions, three schools and 14 different divisions and departments.  Research themes of the GI cancer program are focused on: 1) investigation of the molecular features that drive  the initiation and progression of upper and lower GI cancers; 2) investigation of the host and tumor factors that  govern the behavior of GI cancers; 3) development of novel therapies based on new insights into the behavior  of cancers; and 4) development of novel molecular diagnostics for the early detection and treatment of GI  cancers. The studies are supported by $3.7M in peer-reviewed funding (direct) of which $2.5M is from the NCI  (funding in 2013). Investigators in the GI Cancer Program have published 470 manuscripts, which included  12% intra-programmatic, 44% inter-programmatic, and 17% inter-institutional publications. The high  percentage of inter-programmatic publications reflects the broad collaborations of the GI Cancer Program  members. The specific aims of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program are to:  1) Develop novel biomarker assays that can be used for the prevention and/or early detection of colorectal,  esophageal, and pancreatic cancers and for risk-stratification for these cancers and liver cancer.  2) Develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pancreatic cancers directed at the tumor  microenvironment.  3) Determine the molecular alterations in the major GI cancers (esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, and  colon) and use the molecular profiles to inform and effectively treat the cancers."
"9279861","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The observation that androgen-regulated genes are almost universally expressed in CRPC has prompted a search for processes that contribute to androgen receptor (AR) activation in the castrate environment. While pathways leading to prostate cancer growth and AR signaling may be entirely ligand-independent, many of the processes identified to date either still require or are enhanced by the presence of ligand.  We hypothesize that castration-resistant prostate cancers arise through a process of metabolic adaptation involving the biosynthesis of AR ligands, rather than the selective propagation of rare tumor cells harboring advantageous genomic mutations/chromosomal alterations. Determining the key adaptive components has important implications for developing effective treatment strategies focused on modulating steroidogenic mechanisms. Thus, we also hypothesize that targeting components of androgen metabolism will inhibit the development or progression of CRPC. This proposal will i) evaluate the phenotype(s) of prostate tumor cells arising during metabolic adaptation to castration; and ii) define the AR ligand-generating pathways that emerge, providing novel data on critical nodes amenable to exploitation as therapeutic targets and for stratification of patients for appropriate interventions. We propose the following Specific Aims:  AIM 1. Determine the contribution of steroid biosynthetic enzymes to the generation of intratumoral  androgens and consequent tumor cell survival in CRPC. These studies will determine the frequency and  mechanism(s) by which prostate tumors synthesize androgens de novo, determine the rate-limiting  reactions, and determine if enhanced androgen metabolism contributes to tumor progression.  AIM 2. Determine the mechanism(s) underlying the coordinate regulation of androgen biosynthetic enzymes and activation of the AR gene expression program in prostate cancers following the systemic reduction of androgens.  AIM 3. Determine the therapeutic effectiveness of progressive inhibition of androgen metabolism and identify resistance mechanisms to metabolism-directed therapy in CRPC. These studies will determine the efficacy of progressively severe AR-pathway blockade on inhibiting intratumoral androgen production, evaluate the attendant effects on CRPC, and identify mechanisms leading to further tumor progression/resistance"

Assets: This shared resource has three main assets which make it essential to the research mission of the  Comprehensive Cancer Center. First, it provides consultation on molecular, cellular and viral techniques,  leveraging the expertise of the Director and senior staff. Such consultation includes assisting investigators in  the design, implementation and optimization of new procedures. Second, it provides specialized services  and techniques not easily reproduced in investigators' laboratories. Some recent examples include  cytotoxicity assays to evaluate prospective anticancer agents, modified focus formation assays to uncover  novel oncogenes, expression of recombinant proteins using retroviral vectors or tetracycline-inducible  vectors, and establishment of human and murine primary cell lines from tissue explants. Third, it provides  subsidized access to critical cell culture and molecular biology reagents.  Usage: The laboratory is used by nearly all of the Cancer Center members whose primary focus is basic  science research. Usage of the Cell and Viral Vector Core Laboratory has increased each year since 2001,  and is reflected in laboratory charge-backs which increased 85% between 2006 and 2009. Over 60% of the  CWCL charge-back income in 2010 came from Cancer Center members with active cancer-related funding.  Specialized cell culture services and the ready availability of reagents at a significant savings enhance the  ability of our investigators to efficiently conduct research and support the research efforts of the  Comprehensive Cancer Center and Wake Forest University.  Future directions for the laboratory will include provision of two new services, cell line authentication, and  standardized production of replication-incompetent viruses for gene transfer. These services are provided in  response to changes in the field, and user requests."
"9094434","The Tissue Bank and Biomarkers Core (TBBC) is the central repository of specimens necessary for the execution of the studies of the Colorado SPORE In Lung Cancer program. Furthermore, as an extensive resource for lung cancer related specimens, the TBBC also provides specimens to extramural investigators when there are adequate materials to accommodate these requests beyond the needs of the internal projects. The three primary goals of the TBBC are to procure, characterize and process, and distribute specimens. The provision of these services takes advantage of a close working relationship with the existing facilities, infrastructure, and personnel for biobanking and histology operations of the University of Colorado Cancer Center Tissue Biobanking and Processing Shared Resource. Two general banks are maintained: a tumor bank and a premalignant bank. Specimens for both of these banks are collected as archival tissue or, in collaboration with the Clinical Trials Core, SPORE trial associated specimens and are obtained under IRB approved protocols. In addition to tissue, ancillary specimens including blood, sputa, urine and special bronchoscopic specimens are collected. The TBBC, in collaboration with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics core of the SPORE, also collects correlative clinical and biologic information that can be included in specimen distributions. The TBBC provides histologic and cytologic interpretation, prepares RNA, DNA and protein samples, creates TMAs and provides molecular analysis on selected specimens required by the SPORE projects. This includes histologic review and classification by up-to-date published WHO classification systems for malignant and pre-malignant lesions of the lung by the pathologist members of the core. The core designs its activities to meet the needs of each of the SPORE projects as outlined In the proposal. In order to meet the tissue needs and achieve the goals of the projects, the TBBC collects and processes tissues in a specific manner as determined via collaboration with project investigators. The TBBC also collaborates in the performance of project related studies in which expertise of TBBC personnel can benefit study design, data generation, and data analysis."
"9093733","The overall goal of the Leukemia SPORE Developmental Research Program (LSDRP) is to recruit and  support developmental research projects in leukemia for future peer-reviewed funding and/or future  independent SPORE projects. The types of studies to be supported include projects in basic research,  clinical research, epidemiologic studies, and cancer prevention and control research in leukemia. Projects  supported under the LSRDP will expand the scope of translational research and increase the number of  investigators committed to leukemia research. The LSDRP will work in tandem with the Career Development  Program to assist in the development of junior investigators and in the recruitment and mentoring of minority  investigators. To accomplish these goals, the following specific aims are proposed   1. To support developmental research projects in leukemia for future incorporation as full SPORE  projects and for applications for other major peer-reviewed funding. New research projects will be solicited  and funded using developmental funds. A total of $175,000 has been committed annually to this program  (including $125,000 per year of matching funds from institutional sources). These funds will be used to  support 3-5 developmental projects per year ranging from $30,000 to $60,000 throughout the life of the  SPORE.   2. Foster collaborations between basic and clinical researchers. The LSDRP chairs will facilitate  interaction between basic and clinical researchers through shared weekly meetings, the annual SPORE  retreat, and small group meetings.   3. To provide mentoring to junior faculty. Ail investigators submitting developmental research projects  will receive a written scientific and statistical review, and the LSDRP chairs will be available to discuss the  projects in detail. Where appropriate, mentors will be identified to work with junior faculty.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The Developmental Research Program will recruit and support innovative early-stage research in leukemia."
"9149606","Project Summary Developmental Research Program (DRP)  The DRP will continue to be carried out for the purpose of identifying and facilitating innovative new pilot  projects in head and neck cancer (HNC) research. The specific goals of this Program are: 1) to provide seed  funding opportunities for initial investigation of promising novel research in HNC; 2) to stimulate basic, clinical,  and translational HNC research in areas of high priority to the SPORE; 3) to facilitate development of pilot  projects into full project status in the SPORE or to be competitive for independent investigator-initiated  proposals to other funding agencies; and 4) to increase the visibility of SPORE activities and increase  participation among the institution?s clinicians and researchers. Our design for the DRP in this renewal  application is similar to the process used during the first grant period, which proved successful. Drs. Jennifer R.  Grandis, Robert L. Ferris, and Jonas T. Johnson, and all with ongoing experience in administering this  Developmental Program, will continue to provide leadership for this program to foster translational head and  neck cancer research. During the past grant period, the DRP funded 11 DRP projects in basic, translational,  and clinical research. The DRP Directors track the progress of the successful applications and assign mentors  to funded investigators to ensure that they obtain any needed services from the SPORE Cores and that they  are effectively integrated into the SPORE program. Awardees present their research results to the SPORE  investigators after one year of funding to be eligible for a second year of support. Progress toward translation  as well as impact and innovation will determine whether DRP projects are found to merit promotion to full  SPORE projects. In the past funding period, productive and innovative research funded by DRP awards to Drs.  J. Bauman (and D. Johnson) and Y. Nikiforov (and L. Yip and U. Duvvuri) have been promoted to full projects,  Projects 1 and 4 respectively, in this renewal application. Awardees are also assigned mentors and advised, as  appropriate, in the preparation of grant applications for funding outside the SPORE mechanism and given  access to SPORE Core resources to aid in this endeavor. DRP-supported research has led to 4 NIH awards  (R01CA112219, R01EB016516, R21CA167373, & R21CA180211). There are also several grant applications  submitted or planned based on DRP results from the previous grant period, including an R21 and two  additional R01 applications. The DRP will continue to utilize institutional web-based resources to solicit  proposals from notify the research community at the Univ. of Pittsburgh. A standing DRP Committee, together  with ad hoc reviewers with specific expertise as needed drawn from the UPCI, SPORE Internal & External  Advisory Board, and other SPOREs at UPCI, and/or other Head and Neck SPOREs will continue to provide  rigorous and consistent peer review of the project proposals. Proposals will be solicited and reviewed on an  annual basis. These activities of the DRP will continue to stimulate innovative research toward meeting the  translational goals of the SPORE: reduction in the incidence, morbidity, and mortality from head and neck  cancers."
"9129467","The Tumor Microenvironment and Metastasis (TMM) Program is the newest Program at the IU Simon Cancer  Center (IUSCC); it arose from our strategic plan and from existing collaborations in a working group originally  based in the HMI Program, where interactive investigators looked at solid tumors and metastatic processes.  The research goals of TMM are to: 1) advance our basic understanding of the role of cancer cell stromal  interactions in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis, 2) evaluate the functions of the metastatic niche,  and 3) translate discoveries of the pathobiology of solid tumors, the tumor microenvironment, and the  metastatic niche into new cancer targets and novel therapies. The ultimate programmatic goal of TMM is to  translate discoveries of the tumor microenvironment's pathophysiology into new cancer targets and  appropriately targeted therapies for treating metastatic cancers. Two central themes encompass these goals:  1) Cancer cell-stroma interactions and 2) The metastatic niche. Despite its relatively recent establishment in  late 2009, TMM is highly productive and collaborative in its basic and translational approaches to  understanding the pathobiology of solid tumors, cancer cell-stroma interactions, the tumor microenvironment,  and the metastatic niche. TMM has 25 full and 9 associate members from over 14 departments/divisions on  the campuses of Indiana University School of Medicine, lU-Bloomington, and Notre Dame, including:  Endocrinology, Dermatology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Hem/Onc (Adult and Peds),  Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Radiology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine,  Cellular and Integrative Physiology, Clinical Pharmacology, Medical and Molecular Genetics, OB/GYN, and  Chemistry/Biochemistry (Notre Dame). Over this funding period, TMM members have published a total of  453 papers, of which 31.2% represent intra-programmatic collaborations, 35.7% represent interprogrammatic  collaborations, and 24.7% represent inter-institutional collaborations. The Program has a total  of $8.5M in current peer reviewed funding, with $4.3M from the NCI, $$2.6M from other NIH branches, $1.2M  from the Department of Defense, $180K from the ACS, and $250K in other peer-reviewed funding."

"9149766","ABSTRACT ? CELL DEATH AND SURVIVAL NETWORKS PROGRAM  The long-term goal of the CDSN program is to unravel the mechanisms and signaling networks in normal and  cancer cells that govern their ability to either survive or to undergo various forms of death when stressed (as a  consequence of either the inherent requirements of uncontrolled cancer cell growth, or chemotherapy). The  CDSN program was created in response to new scientific challenges in the field of cell death and in the  emerging area of cancer metabolism. The program includes 17 investigators, including 3 adjuncts, with strong  expertise in autophagy and cell death, metabolic signaling, and structural and chemical biology, who work in a  highly interactive approach with the ultimate goal of efficient translation of our discoveries into more selective  and efficacious therapies. The program consists of three well-defined and highly synergistic themes: (1)  Metabolic and Stress Signaling, (2) Autophagy and Cell Death, and (3) Structural and Chemical Biology. These  themes are conceptually linked, with metabolic and protein stress in cancer cells closely interconnected to cell  survival, cell death, and autophagy. Exploiting these and other signaling pathways through chemical biology is  expected to lead to new therapies for cancer. The program has reinforced its cancer focus, as suggested by  the previous review, and fosters collaborations among its members through joint lab meetings, monthly  program meetings, retreats, and mentoring of junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and students. As documented  by our current annual direct cancer-related funding of $6.8M, the program has been very productive during this  period. Program members currently lead or participate in a total of 42 grants including 24 R01s (15 from NCI),  and 4 P01s (3 from NCI), and have authored 314 cancer-relevant papers (between 2009 and 2013), of which  31% were collaborative (16% intra-programmatic and 15% inter-programmatic). Of these, 50 were published in  2013, 22% intra-programmatic and 20% inter-programmatic. A central goal for the program for the next five  years is to further enhance interactions among members that allow us to address fundamental questions in the  area of cancer metabolism and cell survival. We plan to extend our expertise in these areas by recruiting at  least one faculty in cancer metabolism and, in collaboration with TMEM, another faculty with interest in  metabolism in the tumor stroma, an emerging field at the interface of metabolism, inflammation, and the tumor  microenvironment. Another faculty member will be recruited in the area of autophagy in mouse cancer models.  Our ability to translate our findings into innovative therapies will benefit greatly from the presence of program  members with outstanding expertise in structural and chemical biology and the rational design of drugs based  on structural data, combined with the capabilities of the Conrad Prebys Center for Chemical Genomics in  medicinal chemistry and high-throughput screening."

"9187677","PROJECT 1 ? SUMMARY  Uncontrolled tumor growth (cancer) often results as a consequence of a patient's ineffective immune  responses against the tumor. Cancer immunotherapy aims at restoring the body's defense system with tumor-  specific immune responses. Since dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that can  process and present tumor antigen to T cells to initiate immune responses, DC vaccines are the natural choice  for therapeutic intervention. Approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of sipuleucel-T, a DC vaccine for  advanced prostate cancer, represented a major milestone in this promising field. A DC vaccine is usually  comprised of DCs internalized with tumor antigens and adjuvants. A sequence of physical and biological events  determine the success of a functional DC vaccine to elicit the proper immune responses: 1) The DC vaccine  must migrate from the injection site to lymphoid tissues; 2) The DC vaccine must maintain a mature stimulatory  status to persistently process and present the immunizing antigen to T cells; and 3) The antigen-specific T cells  must travel to the tumor-bearing organ and infiltrate into the tumor microenvironment to exert their anti-tumor  activity. However, these events are often insurmountable hurdles for most DC vaccines thus far. Clinical studies  have shown that only less than 5% of intradermally injected DCs can reach the lymph nodes. In addition, the  stimulatory signals of ex vivo matured DCs cannot be maintained in vivo. Furthermore, the tumor  microenvironment prevents infiltration of the cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, overcoming these sequential barriers  is critical to the development of a successful therapeutic DC vaccine, in order to facilitate effective transport of  the DC vaccine and activated T cells. For Project 1 of the Center for Immunotherapeutic Transport  Oncophysics (CITO), we hypothesize that successful negotiation of the sequential physical and biological  barriers determines accumulation of DC vaccine in the lymph nodes, especially the tumor-draining lymph nodes.  Also, modification of the tumor microenvironment facilitates transport of the effector T cells and macromolecular  drugs that synergize with the Nano-DC vaccine for effective cancer therapy. We have developed a HER2-specific  Nano-DC vaccine to test the hypothesis. The cell surface HER2 protein is expressed in approximately 20-30%  of breast cancers and also in many pancreatic cancer patients. We have recently developed a porous silicon  microparticle (PSM)-based platform for DC vaccine (Nano-DC vaccine) development, and demonstrated that  PSM could serve both as a reservoir for the tumor antigen and as an adjuvant to stimulate the DC cells. We will  apply the Nano-DC vaccine platform in this study, and will test our hypothesis in murine models of breast cancer.  The project will be tightly integrated with the Transport Oncophysics Core (TOC) hinging on its imaging,  quantification, analysis, and computational transport modeling services to enable precision immunotherapy."

"9094435","The goal of the Clinical Trials Core (CTC) is to provide support for clinical trials designed and implemented for SPORE projects. The support includes assistance with trial preparation, regulatory issues, data safety and monitoring, auditing, conduct, and reporting. Our increasing understanding of the molecular basis of lung cancer has reinforced the need to continue conducting studies which involve the collection of both clinical data and specimens for molecular analyses. This translational approach allows for the investigation of biological pathways of lung carcinogenesis in human tissue, and acts as a powerful tool in the evaluation of novel strategies for the prevention, screening, early detection, and treatment of lung cancer. The CTC has been essential in translating the science generated from each of the individual projects.    The CTC has played a crucial role in the Colorado SPORE due the nature of our trials. Our trials have largely focused on chemoprevention, early detection, and tissue acquisition, and have robust enrollments and specimens. Trial subjects are predominantly enrolled from pulmonary clinics at affiliated Hospitals where Cancer Center personnel are not located. These are high risk subjects who do not yet have lung cancer. In addition, specialized training is required for the collection and handling of large numbers of specimens from each procedure at each visit. Special processing to allow separation of diagnostic tissue from remnant tissue and for cell culture is required. The Clinical Trials Core utilizes two databases. The SPORE Bioinformatics core provides a biorepository database that manages the storage and retrieval of biospecimens related to SPORE trials. This database also tracks all SPORE study subjects, enrollments, and personnel providing key statistics for grant reporting. The NCl?s Center for Bioinformatics provided our remote data capture management system in Oracle Clinical, and this provides a full suite of capabilities to facilitate study design, data entry, replication, and discrepancy management. We have a team of clinical research associates expertly trained to accrue subjects and collect data/tissue samples for all SPORE-supported trials. All data is entered into a web database designed to link the clinical information to the biological correlative studies for future analyses. During the previous five year funding period there have been 9 trials supported by the Clinical Trials Core and these trials have enrolled 720 subjects. Additional trials are being actively planned based on basic science and clinical discoveries. The CTC support has led to 34 publications involving all of the projects and to multiple vertical collaborations and subsequent trials"
"9126430","Our main goal is to correlate key proteomic and genomic alterations in melanomas with responses  to next-generation targeted therapy. The new treatment opportunities and the remarkable heterogeneity of  melanoma tumors require better profiling of tumor sub-types to achieve efficient selection of patients for  targeted therapies. We will focus on responses to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) such as PLX4032/RG7204/  Vemurafenib and GSK2118436. The studies will include novel kinase inhibitors developed by Plexxikon to  overcome the paradoxical effect of BRAFi (i.e., stimulation of cells with wild type BRAF), termed paradox  breakers (PLX-PB). Freshly isolated tumors will be characterized at base line before treatment and at the  time of disease progression employing multiplex-phosphoproteomic assays, high throughput sequencing of  coding regions (Exome-Seq), and gene expression arrays to establish a subset of indicators that correlate  with short (< 6 months) versus durable (s 12 months) response to the drug. We will assess the  characteristics of tumors poorly responsive to BRAFi compared to those with durable response, relapsing  over a year after treatment. We expect to identify mechanism(s) of resistance that can be used to devise  alternative treatments. The major translational outcome ofthis work is classification of melanomas by  phospho-proteomic/genomic/gene expression aberrations that show an association between treatment and  response that will lead to development of assays for selection of patients for targeted therapies. In addition,  the project will facilitate clinical trials of novel BRAFv600 kinase inhibitors. Aim 1: To correlate phosphoproteomic,  genomic and gene expression aberrations with resistance to BRAFi. Aim 2: To perform  functional analyses on the best markers associated with treatment response employing melanoma cells in  culture. Aim 3: To conduct a Phase I clinical trial with next-generation paradox-breakers (PB) BRAFi  developed by Plexxikon Inc. We will compare tumor profiles of PLX-PB response to those revealed in Aims  1 and 2."

"9149757","5.3 Abstract - STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY (Core Group A)  The Structural Biology Shared Resource (Core Group A) brings together two major techniques for  determining atomic resolution structures, Crystallography and NMR, with complementary state-of-the-art  Protein Analysis technologies and expertise. These technologies have provided strong support for structural  biology studies, and increasingly are also supporting drug discovery efforts by Cancer Center members. Core  crystallography resources include robotics for crystallization trials and an X-ray generator with two detectors.  NMR resources include four spectrometers, from a highly automated 400 MHz instrument supporting medicinal  chemistry, to a 600 MHz instrument with a cryoprobe supporting structural analysis. The Protein Analysis  Facility utilizes technologies including spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and isothermal titration  calorimetry, supporting the analysis of proteins, as well as protein-protein and protein-small molecule  interactions. On-site custom protein production by the Facility was ended in 2013 after being found to no longer  be cost-effective, but an equivalent service is available at an Institutional Core at Sanford-Burnham's Orlando,  Florida site. The NMR/Crystallography and Protein Analysis Facilities are both managed by highly experienced  Ph.D.-level scientists, who oversee day-to-day operations, train users, and perform or assist in experiments, as  required. The services of a highly experienced crystallographer, Dr. Aleshin, were recently added to the  Shared Resource, providing the final links in the pipeline from gene to protein structure that will transform the  ability of scientists with little prior experience in structural biology to incorporate structural studies, as well as  chemical biology, into their research programs. Dr. Aleshin manages such projects and can either provide the  services or assists in handing off the project to another ?structural? collaborator. Moving forward, this service is  expected to play a central role in executing our plans to incorporate structure-based drug design into the  Shared Resource. While the number of direct users of the Crystallography and NMR Facility is limited, the  scientific impact of such analysis is amplified through a large number of productive collaborations of these  structural biologists with other Center investigators. In the past funding period, 31 Center members have  received services from the Core, with more than 118 peer-reviewed papers by CC members supported by the  Structural Biology Shared Resource. Of note, half of these publications utilized data from our NMR  instruments. This reflects the increasing role of NMR both in chemistry including impressive work in membrane  protein structure led by Dr. Marassi. A well-developed charge-back system is in place, as well as an on-line  instrument-scheduling system. An advisory committee meets, as needed, to resolve any user- or management-  related issues and to discuss future plans. We envisage an expanding role for the Shared Resource over the  next 5 years, continuing to support outstanding basic research, and increasingly also enhancing translational  aspects of Cancer Center members' science."

Specifically, the CSB Program is comprised of 18  members, from 4 Purdue University academic departments and 3 different colleges. These highly collaborative  CSB investigators published 279 papers since the last review in 2010, with 23 (8%) of these involving intra-  programmatic collaborative efforts, 43 (15%) representing inter-programmatic research activities, and 24 (9%)  inter-institutional publications, providing an overall collaborative record of nearly one third of the total (32%).  These efforts are sustained by $4.9M (direct costs) of cancer-related, peer-reviewed, extramural grant support.   Fundamental and technical advances in chemistry, biochemistry, and structural and molecular biology over  the past several decades have provided unprecedented opportunities to probe the living systems involved in  cancer at a molecular level. The complementary, multidisciplinary approaches in this program result in strong  collaborative efforts that focus research groups into effective subgroup teams. Research Clusters in the CSB  Program include: (1) Intracellular Signaling Pathways and Cancer, (2) Membrane Proteins in Cancer, and (3)  Chemical and Biophysical Tools to Probe Molecules Involved in Human Cancer. These Research Clusters use  a variety of approaches to foster discovery. Structural biology approaches allow Program members to address  the molecular mechanism of target molecules using high resolution NMR, X-ray crystallography, cryoelectron  microscopy and a supporting array of biophysical techniques. By developing a structural understanding of  these molecules and their interactions, they provide a framework on which mutations and posttranslational  modifications associated with cancer can be understood and from which new potential inhibitors can be  developed. In this Research Program, proteomic analysis can first define these critical molecular targets and  then researchers can explore epigenetic variations and response to cellular signaling that can provide the  basis for modern molecular medicine approaches to cancer. Chemical biology provides another highly  effective approach for identifying these critical targets and probing their biochemical details in a high-  throughput fashion. By applying groundbreaking chemical methodology, this area of research can drive the  development of unique chemical entities that complement the research being done in basic biological  investigations, therapeutics development, and imaging efforts in the other three Research Programs of the  Purdue University Center for Cancer Research (PCCR)."

"9132693","Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are genetically complex soft-tissue sarconnas that have  one of the highest risks of sarcoma-specific deaths, which could be attributed to its limited responses to  conventional chemo- and radiotherapies as well as its invasive growth that often prevent complete surgical  resection. These clinical observations emphasize the urgent need for novel therapies based on a greater  understanding of molecular and cellular pathogenesis of MPNST. More than 50% of MPNSTs are identified  in individuals afflicted with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NFI). NF1-associated MPNST often arises within a  subpopulation of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST), plexiform neurofibroma (PNF), which is  hypothesized as a congenital lesion caused by NF1 inactivation in multipotent neural crest stem cells  (NCSCs) during nerve development. Thus, NF1-associated MPNST may represent the only sarcoma with a  defined developmental basis and a critical benign precursor lesion. As such prevention treatments could be  a reasonable expectation. Recent studies showed that loss of NF1 activates Ras-mediated extracellularsignal-  regulated/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway in MPNST cell lines.  However, our preliminary studies using genetically engineered mouse (6EM) models showed that despite  consistent activation of Erk/MAPK in pre-neoplastic and benign lesions, nearly half of MPNSTs exhibited no  Erk/MAPK activation. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether multipotent NCSCs are the  cell-of-ongin for a subset of plexiform neurofibromas that have high potentials for recurrence and malignant  transformation (Aim 1). Furthermore, we attempt to determine whether prior to MPNST, there is a critical  therapeutic window(s) in which an ERK/MAPK pathway inhibitor (MEKi) can prevent PNF and MPNST  formation (Aim 2). Finally, we attempt to define a subset of MPNSTs that will respond to MEKi (Aim 3). All  three aims provide a pathway leading to either a prevention strategy and/or therapeutic strategy based on  modern genetic laboratory investigation of appropriate human tissues as well as further development of  mouse models of this disease process."

"9079383","Developmental funds have played a key role in facilitating scientific growth and increased interdisciplinary collaboration at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) during the current funding period. Over the current funding cycle, $80,899 per year was awarded and expended on one new faculty recruitment, one pilot project per year, and support of the development of a Behavioral Measurement Shared Resource (BeMSR), which is being put forth as a competing shared resource as part of this renewal application. We are requesting $295,000 per year of CCSG support for our development program to recruit six new investigators over five years as part of planned expansions of Center programs, to fund up to three pilot projects per year, and to support the development of three new shared resource facilities. The faculty recruit supported by CCSG funds during the current funding period has already received support from NCI. MCC and institutional resources also provided support in the recruitment of 23 additional faculty members to VCU and MCC. Of these, eight have received new NCI funding (35%) with $6.8 M (direct costs, all years) and an additional $6.5 M (total direct costs, all years) in NIH and other extramural funding. Faculty positions and space for recruitment priorities for the next five years have been Identified. While the requested CCSG funds will be more than matched with MCC and institutional funds to accomplish these planned recruitments, pilot projects, and shared cores, the CCSG funds provide critical leverage to obtain matching funds from other institutional sources. Our pilot research project program received a total of 26 applications for the two most recent rounds of funding in 2010. Of these, 13 (50%) were awarded. Over the current funding period, a total of 63 applications were received for review, with a total of 27 (43%) approved for funding with 28.6% awarded in 2008-2009 resulting in extramural funding. The requested increase in CCSG funding will allow us to fund more of these key applications. Member surveys and Program discussions identified specific scientific member needs in the areas of lipidomics, high throughput sequencing, and imaging services. Once the need for each resource was agreed upon and endorsed by Dr Ginder, the identification of space, the acquisition of equipment, and the identification of potential directors was undertaken. Institutional commitment has also been secured to include the personnel required to launch the proposed activities."
